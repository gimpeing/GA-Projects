,Thetruthishere,"When my grandma was in her 20s, she was the sole survivor of a small plane crash. Her husband and two friends they were with died, and the only reason she survived is because her husband wrapped his body around hers to protect her from the impact.

After the plane crash, she was in the hospital in a coma for 3 weeks. During that coma, she saw a light at the end of a tunnel. She wanted to go towards the light but a figure appeared at the end.

,Thetruthishere,"It was evening About a year and a half ago.  My youngest daughter, who was 3 at the time, suddenly let out a horrified scream from the living room, followed by an episode of scared crying. I was getting my other daughter dried off after her bath and ran out to see what happened. 

I found her running towards me from the other side of one of the chairs in the living room. I said “what happened?!” She was sobbing and grabbing onto me so I picked her up and said “what’s wrong?” 
She wouldn’t tell me so I just let her cry until she calmed down. We went to the room she snd her sister shared, and finally she told me she saw a face under the chair. 

I need to mention, I didn’t watch anything scary while the kids were around, nor did I allow them to watch anything considered scary. They were always with me unless they were at daycare and I was at work. 

I asked her what the face looked like. She furrowed her brow, grit and bared her teeth and twisted her nose up. The contortion she performed startled me. She had not made that face before. I said “ok, well, I’m going to go check and I promise you, I’ll take care of it, whatever I find.” 

I felt on edge but checked under all the chairs expecting for something to appear to me. I found nothing. I ended up calling my parents, who are religious, and the prayed for us. I did that to comfort the kids, but I believe my daughter must have seen something.

,Thetruthishere,"This takes place in Grand Rapids, Mi. 

About 18 years ago when I was 17-18 I was living across the state from Grand Rapids. I was a senior in high school and I had a lot of friends who had graduated and went to college. One weekend a friend and I decided to take a trip to see some of our friends and spend the weekend at their house. When we got there we realized the house was down a weird dead end street. It was like a normal city neighborhood but you could turn down this one almost not noticeable street that looked almost like an alley and there was like 5-10 houses down it and they were all in pretty bad shape. 

When we got there it was a really big and old like 5 bedroom house and there was a couple people living there and a couple people I was just meeting for the first time. We met and all got along and were having a good time. Then they started telling me about how weird the street was and how all the neighbors have been living there for a long time. So we started partying and my friend started telling me he loved living in the house but things were weird because he was a really curious dude and he said the landlord told them specifically when they moved in he knew they were gonna be partying a lot and just doing typical young college kid stuff. Then he starts telling me about the basement. 

He tells me after the landlord told him he didn’t care what they did the one rule he had in the house, and he was very adamant about this, was to never under any circumstances try not to open the doors in the basement. Obviously at this point my interest is piqued. So after a discussion we head down to the basement. 

To set this up visually... the basement was like one of those very old basements where everything is cement. It was super dirty and long and had big cement support pillars down the middle and there was nothing in it. Now on either side of the room there was doors. Big doors. And when I saw them my heart sank. 

Both doors had about 1000 nails in them. All over. Some of them were bent, some were sticking out. It looked like someone was frantically nailing this thing as shut as they could. Both of them. We discussed it for awhile and decided not to open the doors and honestly I really regret it. I still think about it from time to time. I have no idea what was behind them. We’ve discussed so many possibilities. Was it like an old well? But if so why would they be on both sides of the house? Was it maybe old tunnels? The house was really old. My the ultimate reason my friend didn’t want us opening the doors is because he was afraid a poltergeist was trapped or something, which I laughed off. 

I don’t even think the house is still there but I know they asked the landlord again what was behind the doors and all he would say is “just promise me you’ll never try and open them”",t2_3ut2p2ub,False,,0,False,Adamant landlord,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_ffxzsu,False,dark,,public,12,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,12,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583802725.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This takes place in Grand Rapids, Mi. &lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"A couple months ago me and my buddy were drinking at our friends house and we both decided we wanted to leave. Of course being the responsible guys we are we agreed to walk to my house and I would drive him to pick up his car in the morning. It was about 3am and pretty cold. I only had a sweatshirt on and was shivering a little bit.

At one point in the walk a cemetery was up about a quarter mile to the right. I looked up and saw a little girl with black hair running into the cemetery and immediately I told my friend to look but he looked too late and didn’t see her as she disappeared into the cemetery. I explained to him what I saw and obviously he thought I was crazy and just seeing things and wrote it off as I had a little too much to drink. 

Fast forward about 5 minutes later and we’re walking on the left side of the road with the cemetery to our right immediately next to the road. 

We’re just walking and talking but I couldn’t stop thinking about the little girl I saw running. She had no coat or sweatshirt and it was cold out. Just as I was about to stop thinking about it she pops out from a bush right next to the cemetery on the other side of the road. She popped out of the bush and sprinted down the road, I froze with fear and my friend immediately started laughing. I asked him why the fuck are you laughing and he said because I can’t believe my eyes right now. She kept running, pretty fast I may add and just like that she was gone. She didn’t disappear like a gosht or anything she just was too far away to see anymore maybe she hid in another bush i’m not sure.

,Thetruthishere,"A little background first. I am a sensitive and have seen ghosts, spirits, demons, unknown things. I currently have a 10 month old daughter.

It’s a proper crib with the mattress lowered so she can’t fall out and can stand up. There is a night light at the foot of her crib that is always on. 

It’s the middle of the night. We are all asleep. I wake up to something brush my face lightly..Felt like maybe air? Anyways, I open my eyes a little confused why I’m awake. I lightly hear my baby whispering and light laughing. I open my eyes and look around. I see her walking next to bed! Wobbly holding on the side of the bed and crib to balance.

I’m starting to sit up and she starts walking back towards my way. Closer to the head of the crib. She keeps looking inside the crib excited and lightly laughing/whispering.

After speaking to a few elders. I was told it was just a friendly spirit nothing evil. That’s why it was allowed to enter even after being blessed. It just wanted to play and changed it’s form.

,Thetruthishere,"To understand the Creator you can learn about Him through learning about yourself.  For we were made in His image and likeness.

&amp;#x200B;

We all have our inner personalities as well as our external behavior.  There is the inner “you” and the “you” that you show to the world, your true self, and your behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

We see in ourselves that our external actions are not always aligned with our inner selves. External actions of rage and anger can be traced to inner feelings of innocent love and desire to be loved that were unmet. A lack of inner self-confidence can cause us to invest our love and attention in the wrong places.

&amp;#x200B;

This disconnect between our true inner feelings and emotions and our external actions is a reflection of the Kingship of Heaven. This is also known as God's supervision in the world.  


The Creator has ""His inner personality"" which is pure goodness and includes the 13 attributes of mercy.  The Creator has His external actions which are the Divine Supervision of the world along with it's ""Judgements"", which are the bad things that happen on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

These Harsh Judgements are not the true will of the Creator's Inner Being.They are not expressions of who He really is, but rather the results of the Judgements calculated by the system of Heaven's Court, the system the Creator made to judge the world according to its actions and intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

When you will understand this teaching deeply about yourself, you will be able to penetrate through the layers of the Creator's Divine Supervision and recognize His true Goodness.  This is the inner aspect of all Creation and the Creator Himself.

&amp;#x200B;

The practical action we can take from this is to invest more effort into revealing a true correlation between our true inner selves and our external actions that are based on goodness. By doing so, it gives power to the Kingship of Heaven to overpower the system of Judgments in place today. This allows the revelation of Divine Supervision on the world that is based on His true Inner Goodness and Infinite Kindness. by Rav Dror Moshe Cassouto, u/RavDror, [www.Emunah.com](https://www.Emunah.com) @RavDror on Social Media",t2_k9lxxsi,False,,0,False,How to Understand the Creator,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_fg1lzl,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583815847.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the Creator you can learn about Him through learning about yourself.

,Thetruthishere,"I've had a couple of supernatural / paranormal experiences in my life but there is one that stands out from them all. When I was about 28 I was living in an apartment with a friend of mine. Things were great between us we got along so well and worked well as flatmates. One night we were pretty bored so we decided to go onto the Three Kings subreddit (r/threekings) and try to do a ritual. She was very much into the idea of it but I wasn't because she had no experience with magic or meditation or hypnotism or anything outside of the norm. So I can't remember which ritual it was but I'll describe it as best I can. So I had to hypnotise her which involved reading out a prewritten script, pretty much saying you are getting sleepy, very relaxed, even 10 times more relaxed etc. The thing is I actually hypnotised her. She fell into the hypnosis like instantly. Next there was the ritual part which involved meeting something hidden behind a door that will show her the future. So I was reading out another prewritten script of her walking down a hall looking at different doors, opening the doors and seeing whats on the other side. She described what was on the side doors as nothing, or white light. When she finally got to the door at the end of the hall she was very hesitant to open it. She opened the door and her face changed. A huge grimace came over her face, like a huge smile showing all of her teeth. Straight away I felt light something was wrong and I told her to come out of the hypnosis. But she didn't. She started speaking gibberish that I didnt understand and then finally she said ""He's here, he's here"" Over and over. And now this is where the next thing happens. The lamp next to her flickered a couple of times. It wasn't that intense but it totally freaked me out. I tried to talk to her slowly to wake up again, but she just sat there with her head down whispering gibberish. Suddenly she raised her head and looked at me with her own eyes again.

When I was about 28 I was living in an apartment with a friend of mine. Things were great between us we got along so well and worked well as flatmates. One night we were pretty bored so we decided to go onto the Three Kings subreddit (&lt;a href=""/r/threekings""&gt;r/threekings&lt;/a&gt;) and try to do a ritual. She was very much into the idea of it but I wasn&amp;#39;t because she had no experience with magic or meditation or hypnotism or anything outside of the norm. So I can&amp;#39;t remember which ritual it was but I&amp;#39;ll describe it as best I can. So I had to hypnotise her which involved reading out a prewritten script, pretty much saying you are getting sleepy, very relaxed, even 10 times more relaxed etc. The thing is I actually hypnotised her. She fell into the hypnosis like instantly. Next there was the ritual part which involved meeting something hidden behind a door that will show her the future. So I was reading out another prewritten script of her walking down a hall looking at different doors, opening the doors and seeing whats on the other side. She described what was on the side doors as nothing, or white light. When she finally got to the door at the end of the hall she was very hesitant to open it. She opened the door and her face changed. A huge grimace came over her face, like a huge smile showing all of her teeth. Straight away I felt light something was wrong and I told her to come out of the hypnosis. But she didn&amp;#39;t. She started speaking gibberish that I didnt understand and then finally she said &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s here, he&amp;#39;s here&amp;quot; Over and over. And now this is where the next thing happens. The lamp next to her flickered a couple of times. It wasn&amp;#39;t that intense but it totally freaked me out. I tried to talk to her slowly to wake up again, but she just sat there with her head down whispering gibberish. Suddenly she raised her head and looked at me with her own eyes again. &amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; She said. We talked into the night but.. she seemed different. Over the next few weeks she changed. She seemed quiet and distant, and got angry a couple of times which wasn&amp;#39;t like her. Gradually she started to get better but she wasn&amp;#39;t exactly the same again. I recommend staying away from Three Kings rituals unless you know what you&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

My account was banned from r/paranormal, due to the fact that they have terrible mods on it, who gave no warnings to anyone when they get banned.

He was quiet, he absolutely adored my mom, and he was generally, one of the best dogs to ever live, statistically speaking. 

When he passed, I would see him in a couple of my dreams (posted on this account) and I think he was just trying to say Hi. 

Story: Right now, it’s 3:32am, so I was just going downstairs to get some water, and when I turn the corner, I see him. It was a black shadow, almost physical, like an outline quite distinguished. He was sitting on the stairs, looking down at the kitchen. It took a moment, maybe 3 seconds before I turn on the hallway light, so I could see him for maybe 3-4 seconds. 
I ran downstairs to get a glass of water before scrambling up the steps.

,Thetruthishere,"First I'd like to say I'm glad I found this sub because I never get to talk about this experiences, I'm 25, way past the age when you make up ghost stories, but there's no way of telling this kind of stuff without it looking that you are just lying, I can't even believe myself when talking about this.

I used to suffer from sleep paralysis a lot, it has always been terrifying, but there's just two instances where what happened was just completely out of normal.

The first time I was like 15 maybe, I was going through a face where I was starting to believe in God and was learning about him and reading the Bible. Sleep paralysis usually happens in the middle of the night, but this time it happened early in the morning, It was like my head was draged to the curtains by itself, and I could clearly see two red eyes, when I had sleep paralysis you could hear anything in particular, maybe a resemblance of shouts but nothing clear, this time was different. With a really unsettling voice the eyes were telling me to ""do it"", they told me do it over and over and over, I couldn't snap out of it for a really long time, I couldn't even talk back to it inside my mind or anything.

When it was over I was really sceptical about what had happened, part of me didn't believed it was real, and the other part trying to make sense out of it couldn't understand what was ""it"", I had no idea what this thing wanted me to do. I kept it for myself for a time, but later told my grandma, and asked her what she thought this thing wanted me to do, she advised me to not even try to learn what it wanted and just pray.

I had thought maybe I was a bit biased since I was reading the Bible for the first time, and maybe my mind made a demon for me, but the truth is, the devil is not very ""demonic"" in the Bible, yes he is mean beyond normal standards but he is never described in any way and when you read what he says he just sounds like a regular man making people or god question themselves, and the red eyes didn't mention anything about religion and I didn't took it that way, still maybe it had something to do with it if it was real.

The second time I saw them was 10 times more terrifying.
 I was working for a friend looking after her country house while her family was away, Iwas having a really hard time. The place was just enormous and had no way of stoping people form jumping the small grids, some places you could stick through without even jumping, and her family was rather wealthy, having a lot of valuables inside the house.

From the house to the nearest entrance must have been like a km, and there I learned woods are not like in the movies, take 5 steps away from the light the house gives you and it's pitch black, you won't see 1 meter in front of you and it was as if flash lights got their light sucked out of them, using them would only give you 3 more meters in one direction.

I was on the process of buying a gun when my friend forbid it, I don't live in the USA where people are ok with guns, she didn't like the idea of me killing someone who was just planning to steal a couple of oranges out of fear, I asked for a crossbow and she told me there wouldn't be any weapons in her house if I wanted to keep the job.

I used to sleep in her tv room (I was not allowed but that's another story) because I would play my PS4 there until I fell asleep, always with a knife bellow my pillow, one day I heard steps on the floor below, and to my bad look I had sleep paralysis as soon as they woke me up, I could here these cautious steps going up the stairs cracking without being able to move, later they got to my couch, I had my face covered with the blanket.

I was trying to reach my knife but I just couldn't move, later I swear for my life that the guy gently put the cover out of my face, I could stare at him at that point, it was really dark and couldn't see past his hoodie, he had the cap on. After like 2 seconds and the adrenaline just rushing I snapped out with hit but the guy just banished, it was as if it was made of a shadow out of smoke, I swear I could see the smoke  like for 2 or 3 seconds before it disappeared towards one of the two paintings upstairs.

I told this to my friend and asked her if the paintings had some story behind them. She kinda laughed it off, and told me they were old but that a friar and some fruit had nothing to do with people made out of smoke wearing clothes from the 21st century.

That was like 5 years ago, I haven't had a similar experience since then, and I truly hope I just don't.
I don't believe in this kind of stuff, I don't know if I convinced myself over the years or if it happened so long ago it just doesn't feel real anymore.

My first time posting but after reading so many of these kinds of things, I wanted to share. \n\nBackstory: my dad passed away in 2015. He was 64, so not super young, but it was a shock to us all because all 4 of my grandparents were still alive and well, and we obviously didn’t expect for him to die before them. So, My mom says that she felt like he was “still around” the house after he died, as she would see shadows, hear foot steps etc. I kind of chalked it to her just being alone now in a house where they used to be together. (I didn’t live there at the time, but did live there a couple years later in 2017-mid 2019) in 2017, her father, my Grampa, died as well. \noverall, she does believe in spirits and ghosts, etc and *used* to be quite Christian. She’s had paranormal experiences and is open minded but realistic.. her first guess isn’t always like “OHH GHOST!” She tried to figure it out logically before going to any paranormal conclusions as to not freak herself out. \n\nThe experience:\nIn late 2018, in the time i was living with her, I had a boyfriend who’s house I would stay at a few nights a week, as you do. She said that one night when I wasn’t there, she woke up in the middle of the night because she felt something was watching her. She opened her eyes and recalls a large shadowy face, with not super defined features but like a floating egg head with indents for eyes etc. No body. She flung herself out of bed, screaming, and threw a chair at it (scaring the shit out of my dog and cat who sleep in the bed with her. I don’t know if they sensed anything, I don’t think she can remember except when she screamed and got up they jumped up too). It disappeared into thin air. She turned on the lights and waited, but eventually fell back asleep. (Idk how she fell asleep after something like that lol)\n\nThe next night, she woke up again in the middle of the night, but this time to a glowing white orb above her in bed. She says it was the size of a pomelo. She, again, got scared and started screaming and kind of flailing her arms. The orb floated slowly out of the room, (unlike the face that just sort of dissipated). \nWhen I came home a couple days later, she told me what happened. I immediately was freaked out and also confused. What are these two things doing, battling!? Dark vs light? And so we went to a bruja shop, got crystals etc. (Yes we like crystals and believe in energy and all that) \n\nShe said things subsided for a while, but one night (again, as I was away for the night), she was getting ready for bed, and she said she felt a need to turn around while brushing her teeth so that she was facing the bedroom. When she turned, she saw a blurry gray man run and jump into the bed, like a dive into a pool, and disappear into it. She said it didn’t feel very malicious. She was spooked but still went to bed. \n\nThe next day, she told me about this third experience, and I freaked. I’m telling her to get a shaman in this house quick, especially as I’m set to be moving out of her house and kind of far away. So now she’s gonna be alone!? No, not on my watch!!!! \n\nShe’s done some work with this particular shaman before, so the shaman knows us and our family a bit. She does some reiki work as well over my mom, and gives her instructions on how to proceed and get the spirits out of our house. I do this ritual with her, and so far, she hasn’t had any more spirits around her room at night. \n\nSomething that the shaman said to her though has stuck with me ever since. My first guess when thinking about the entities coming to my mom at night, is that it was my dad (first black shadowy face) and then my Grampa (her dad, as the glowing orb). My dad and grandpa didn’t really get along. My grandpa was very protective of my mom, and never thought my dad was the best man for her. \n\nBut then I’m thinking, why would my dad be a dark shadowy face? It unfortunately makes sense, even though I would like it not to. He was a difficult man, and in his opinion, was going to finish life too soon. He wasn’t ready to go. \n\nLet’s go back to the shaman. She practices some past life guided meditations, and in her reiki work with my mom, told her that my dad was essentially stuck to her. Why? Because they had many past lives together. Cute, right? No. Fuck no. Apparently, in every past life before this one, he had out-lived her..... and the shaman said he had basically done anything to remain the survivor. So killed her, let her die, etc. The shaman said she saw it all there, and that he couldn’t let Go of my mom in this life because he was pissed that he went first. \nI honestly wish I could be like, nah that’s crazy. Dad wouldn’t kill mom, hurt her, or haunt her, etc. But the fucked part is that I can totally see  it. It makes sense to me. It hurts my heart to admit that but I can see my dad being someone who puts himself before everyone else.. he didn’t think he deserved to die. He even admitted once to my mom as she was taking care of him throughout his sickness that if the tables were turned, he probably wouldn’t have stuck around to take care of her. 😑 \n\nAnyways. What do you think?? Shadow man? Angel/demon? And who the hell jumped into her bed!? (She said it wasn’t my dad.) \n\nSorry this was so long. But it’s been something I’ve been thinking about and dealing with for the past 4 years 😓 \n\nTL;DR: my mom was haunted, I think it was my dad haunting her, and my deceased grandpa is trying to protect her from my dads darkness.', 'author_fullname': 't2_55y8ohuu', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'My dead dad is haunting my mom', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Haunting'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Paranormal', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'd', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fd2q6e', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 17, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Haunting', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 17, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583303106.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.Paranormal', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all.

(I didn’t live there at the time, but did live there a couple years later in 2017-mid 2019) in 2017, her father, my Grampa, died as well. \noverall, she does believe in spirits and ghosts, etc and &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be quite Christian. She’s had paranormal experiences and is open minded but realistic.. her first guess isn’t always like “OHH GHOST!” She tried to figure it out logically before going to any paranormal conclusions as to not freak herself out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The experience:\nIn late 2018, in the time i was living with her, I had a boyfriend who’s house I would stay at a few nights a week, as you do. She said that one night when I wasn’t there, she woke up in the middle of the night because she felt something was watching her. She opened her eyes and recalls a large shadowy face, with not super defined features but like a floating egg head with indents for eyes etc. No body. She flung herself out of bed, screaming, and threw a chair at it (scaring the shit out of my dog and cat who sleep in the bed with her. I don’t know if they sensed anything, I don’t think she can remember except when she screamed and got up they jumped up too). It disappeared into thin air. She turned on the lights and waited, but eventually fell back asleep. (Idk how she fell asleep after something like that lol)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next night, she woke up again in the middle of the night, but this time to a glowing white orb above her in bed. She says it was the size of a pomelo. She, again, got scared and started screaming and kind of flailing her arms. The orb floated slowly out of the room, (unlike the face that just sort of dissipated). \nWhen I came home a couple days later, she told me what happened. I immediately was freaked out and also confused. What are these two things doing, battling!? Dark vs light? And so we went to a bruja shop, got crystals etc. (Yes we like crystals and believe in energy and all that) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said things subsided for a while, but one night (again, as I was away for the night), she was getting ready for bed, and she said she felt a need to turn around while brushing her teeth so that she was facing the bedroom. When she turned, she saw a blurry gray man run and jump into the bed, like a dive into a pool, and disappear into it. She said it didn’t feel very malicious. She was spooked but still went to bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, she told me about this third experience, and I freaked. I’m telling her to get a shaman in this house quick, especially as I’m set to be moving out of her house and kind of far away. So now she’s gonna be alone!? No, not on my watch!!!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She’s done some work with this particular shaman before, so the shaman knows us and our family a bit. She does some reiki work as well over my mom, and gives her instructions on how to proceed and get the spirits out of our house. I do this ritual with her, and so far, she hasn’t had any more spirits around her room at night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something that the shaman said to her though has stuck with me ever since. My first guess when thinking about the entities coming to my mom at night, is that it was my dad (first black shadowy face) and then my Grampa (her dad, as the glowing orb). My dad and grandpa didn’t really get along. My grandpa was very protective of my mom, and never thought my dad was the best man for her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I’m thinking, why would my dad be a dark shadowy face? It unfortunately makes sense, even though I would like it not to. He was a difficult man, and in his opinion, was going to finish life too soon. He wasn’t ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the shaman. She practices some past life guided meditations, and in her reiki work with my mom, told her that my dad was essentially stuck to her. Why? Because they had many past lives together. Cute, right? No. Fuck no. Apparently, in every past life before this one, he had out-lived her..... and the shaman said he had basically done anything to remain the survivor. So killed her, let her die, etc. The shaman said she saw it all there, and that he couldn’t let Go of my mom in this life because he was pissed that he went first. \nI honestly wish I could be like, nah that’s crazy. Dad wouldn’t kill mom, hurt her, or haunt her, etc. But the fucked part is that I can totally see  it. It makes sense to me. It hurts my heart to admit that but I can see my dad being someone who puts himself before everyone else.. he didn’t think he deserved to die. He even admitted once to my mom as she was taking care of him throughout his sickness that if the tables were turned, he probably wouldn’t have stuck around to take care of her. 😑 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways. What do you think?? Shadow man? Angel/demon? And who the hell jumped into her bed!? (She said it wasn’t my dad.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry this was so long. But it’s been something I’ve been thinking about and dealing with for the past 4 years 😓 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: my mom was haunted, I think it was my dad haunting her, and my deceased grandpa is trying to protect her from my dads darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'new', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '6e7e38f8-9edc-11e2-be54-12313b06caaf', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qjxn', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#0dd3bb', 'id': 'fd2q6e', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Any-Impression', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 5, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/Paranormal/comments/fd2q6e/my_dead_dad_is_haunting_my_mom/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/fd2q6e/my_dead_dad_is_haunting_my_mom/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 550954, 'created_utc': 1583274306.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",t3_fd2q6e,

After a slow curving descent the object leveled off and flew toward Bastia Airfield.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 4, 1971 \xa0-\xa0 Lago de Cote, Costa Rica -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130409075827im_/http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/photosmain/costarica01.jpg""&gt;Images Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The photo above (cropped and enlarged) was taken by a Costa Rican government mapping plane during an aerial mapping mission. This UFO photograph is unique for several reasons. 1) The photograph was taken by a high-quality, professional camera. 2) The unidentified object is plainly visible against the uniformly dark background of the lake and appears in sharp focus. 3) The camera was aimed downward and the plane was flying at a known, fixed altitude (10,000 feet), which makes it easy to calculate a maximum size for the object (683 feet).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The plane carried a crew of four; a specialist in aerial photography, a geographer, a topographer, and the pilot. No member of the crew stated that they saw anything unusual during the routine flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much analysis has been undertaken using the original negative, most notably by Dr. Richard F. Haines and Dr. Jacques F. Vallee. It seems safe to assume that it is not a double-exposure or the result of manipulation of the negative. All indications are that this is a photo of a large three-dimensional disk , or shallow cone, [hovering?] above, and possibly partially submerged in Lago de Cote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': 'a95a55a0-60ff-11ea-96bd-0e982b31aa79', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': ':Australia: Australia :Australia:', 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2gwjtk', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#ffd635', 'id': 'ff8ur4', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'RevenTexX', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 13, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': None, 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'permalink': '/r/Skydentify/comments/ff8ur4/historical_ufo_photos_look_oddly_similar/', 'parent_whitelist_status': None, 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Skydentify/comments/ff8ur4/historical_ufo_photos_look_oddly_similar/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1653, 'created_utc': 1583649714.0, 'num_crossposts': 7, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",t3_ff8ur4,
,Thetruthishere,"This started a few months ago, possibly September.

I was attempting to fall asleep, when I hear whispering in the corner of my bedroom. Now, I have a large air conditioner outside on my patio, but this whispering was loud enough to physically hear overtop the loud noises of the conditoner. Two voices, maybe female, maybe male, but couldn’t distinctively understand them, which would’ve gave me a clue if they were female/male.
I’m never prepared for these situations, so when I’m scared, I immediately turn on my light and read a book to get my mind off of things, and it helps me sleep.

The next happened in October. 
My dog (rip Baxter) was on my bed, sleeping. I was attempting to fall asleep as well, when I hear static electricity on my bedroom carpet. Like ZZZ. I was kinda scared, when I began to hear heavy breathing, as if you ran for a maybe 10-15mins non-stop. Me, being the skeptic I was, put my ear to my dog’s face, cause I know my dog can sometimes breath quite loudly. 
My whole body went stone cold. 

The heavy breathing was louder than my dog’s breathing, and I could hear it overlap. NOPE, NOT AGAIN! I pulled my string light as fast as I could, and IT STILL WAS HAPPENING, keep in mind, this is at the FOOT OF MY BED, very, very close. 

I began reading fast, heart pounding like I’ve never had before. Scrolling through the pages, the heavy breathing slowly, but surely, disappeared. 

A few nights after, I heard heavy footsteps downstairs, like my dad’s footwear, but I knew my dad was asleep, cause I could hear his snoring. My brother was on his phone in his room, or asleep, so he was home, and not away, so it couldn’t have been him.

This is one of the strange occurrences, that I actually did have a confirmed Paranormal Experience. I’ve only had two others, the shadow at scouts and Gnomes.

,Thetruthishere," I am sharing this wherever I think would make sense .. So here goes.

I have lived in my apartment for 3 years now and other than things falling randomly that I would usually blame on my cats I have never experienced anything paranormal. My boyfriend claims to see white lights at night in our bed room but i don't know , I feel there is always a logical explanation for things.

Yesterday I felt particularly ""spooked"" in my apartment I felt like someone was behind me , like I felt a presence . But also I am a fat baby when it comes to these things so I never take myself seriously . Anyway this is where It gets weird. That night my phone rang I was expecting a call from my best friend. So I pick up and say hello. And what I heard was a doll like voice laughing and giggling . She has a 1  year old daughter who does not sound like that but I just assumed it was her , so i was like ""awww hi "" all the while being creeped the f out and wondering what her daughter who goes to bed at 8 was up at 12 am. Then it quickly cut to my friend and she was like "" Was that you ? what are you doing ? tell me you are joking with me ."" I felt the blood leave my face . I was like "" no what did you hear"" thinking she heard the same thing or maybe some static. She was in shock she told me she heard a demonic man voice say ""hellooooooooooooo"" clearly and then cut to me saying hello. We spent the next few minutes arguing as she thought I was joking with her and I thought she was joking with me (even though she is not the type of person to do something like that ) . We established that it could have just been a weird glitch or something and left it at that.

I am so spooked from this lmao. Has anyone experienced something like this ? I never heard a sound like that in my life other than maybe in movies. I'm glad she heard something too because I feel like no one would have believed me .

,Thetruthishere,"So, sometimes my mind goes blank then my reflexes increase, my strength sky-rockets, my accuracy sky-rockets, and my hunting skills improve. Also, I remember everything when this happens and can control it and myself perfectly.

Example of hunting skills improving: I can track anything without having to look at them. I also can sense where people are around me and know details about them. I've named it Hunting Mode. Plus, I become very intimidating.

Examples of reflexes improving: I can block something from hitting me without even knowing it was there. I blocked my sister from hitting me from behind without knowing she was going to do it.

Example of accuracy improving: When I wanted to throw a pen at my sister to aggravate her. So, when her back was turned I decided to throw it at the back of her head. The only reason why it didn't hit her head is because she moved the last second. I was at least twenty feet away from her, and I was able to activate the ""Hunting Mode""

Example of strength improving: I was practicing using it then, my friend wanted to try to intimidate me by grabbing my shirt while getting in my face. So, I pushed him back and almost made him fall. I'm not usually strong enough to do that because he is a big guy.

Example of becoming intimidating: My friend doesn't like it when people push him, so he would usually become furious. That time he seemed horrified of me. Also, when I decided to look at myself in the mirror while doing it, it felt like it was tearing my mind apart. My eyes also looked like it was empty or there was just an endless, and empty abyss there.

Example of sensing people around me: My mind went blank and my head slowly rotated to where another person was in a car next to me.

When I did see who it was in the car I was right about there gender, age and where they were located in the car (those are the only ones I could verify).

,Thetruthishere,"Hi there! I just recently got this subreddit recommended to me by my phone and I thought I'd share some of my own experiences. You don't have to know absolutely everything about me but in my relatively short lifetime I've had some strange encounters. 2 years ago I moved from a relatively small village to a larger city, though in a pretty bad neighbourhood. And in these 2 years I've had the most haunting experiences I've ever had in any home I've lived in. Now as a bored teen I've practise and still practise some 'odd' hobbies like Tulpamancy and things related to that. And I know I'm not the most 100% sane person. However ever since the summer of 2019 I've heard strange noises coming from my neighbourhood and have seen strange lights in the skies. (I'll explain more about those lights in another post though. I've got them on video and camera). 
It started with odd clicking noises that would go on for a good 30 seconds to a minute before stopping and then returning later, with no set interval. It would usually be more than an hour, sometimes even 2 hours between the first clicking noises and the second clicking noises. And they would always start when it was about to turn pitch black outside. The sound was comparable to somebody taking a series of fast pictures or a fast camera shutter that was quite loud. It sounded eerily similar to one of the beasts from early videos from TheSunVanished oddly enough and when I first started hearing it I had a minor breakdown cause when I looked outside I also witnessed a red light while the sound was playing. But I've since debunked that light as just being a light from one of the neighbours backyards. That sound remained unanswered though.

It remained till around October-November when it dissapeared as suddenly as it initially appeared and was quickly replaced by a sound that would haunt my nights. A demonic screaming that hasn't stopped till this day. It's rather soft so It doesn't echo much further than my neighbourhood probably and usually appeares around 30 minutes before midnight and keeps going till around midnight. Occasionally I hear it way later at night aswell but that's a rare occurance. I have no clue what the source is and I'm unsure if I really want to know at this point. But luckily I haven't been attacked by anything demonic (directly). And I've grown somewhat used to it now.
I've asked my mom about these noises and she said she's never heard them directly. However she has been woken up by the rattleing and shaking of our backyard garden fence, this could all just be the wind aswell however. Near the end of 2019 our backyard fence gate got ripped out of its seem aswell. I've passed it off as the wind aswell just being to powerfull for the old gate however. My stepfather did quickly replace it with an all new fence while the old fence was suposedly ok, but he's done similar things before so it's not out of the ordinary.

What do you think? I'd be thrilled to read what you guys think of this and if you guys want to hear more of my personal experiences.

I just recently got this subreddit recommended to me by my phone and I thought I&amp;#39;d share some of my own experiences. You don&amp;#39;t have to know absolutely everything about me but in my relatively short lifetime I&amp;#39;ve had some strange encounters. 2 years ago I moved from a relatively small village to a larger city, though in a pretty bad neighbourhood. And in these 2 years I&amp;#39;ve had the most haunting experiences I&amp;#39;ve ever had in any home I&amp;#39;ve lived in. Now as a bored teen I&amp;#39;ve practise and still practise some &amp;#39;odd&amp;#39; hobbies like Tulpamancy and things related to that. And I know I&amp;#39;m not the most 100% sane person. However ever since the summer of 2019 I&amp;#39;ve heard strange noises coming from my neighbourhood and have seen strange lights in the skies.

,Thetruthishere,"Nightmares and weird noises

So for some background, I moved into a new apartment back in mid January. The apartment we moved into were older but had just been renovated and were super homey feeling and cozy. I honestly love my apartment and have no issues with it at all, no creepy vibes,  actually I feel super at peace there. The problem started last weekend, I went to sleep around 9 on Saturday and was woken up around 11:30 by the sound of someone stomping up the stairs of the apartment next to me. I looked outside, no neighbors car, thought it was weird but whatever and went to sleep. Starting from then every hour I would have a nightmare, wake up and see it was an hour from when I had went to sleep, and this repeated every hour until 4am when I would last until I woke up for work. This repeated almost down to the minute for 4 days . The only break i had was Wednesday when I stayed up till 12 and there was no stair noise and when I went sleep no nightmares at all. Last night I laid down around 9, wife as well. 11:30 came and there came the noise, just as some insight the neighbor has not been home in like 2 weeks, not sure why. I heard the noise, looked at my wife to tell her but she did not wake up. Went back to sleep and there’s a nightmare again, I woke up at 12:40 and more annoyed than anything, decided to stay awake till after 3 and then laid down.

,Thetruthishere,"So like 2 nights ago, it was around 1am and I heard someone coming down the stairs. I thought it was my mom so I pretended to sleep while I listened to my door very slowly but loudly crack open. (It’s pitch dark in my room so I can only feel and hear everything it does) as soon as it comes in, it comes up to me and rubbed something that felt like a jacket on my face for about 5 seconds. It chills there for a second before walking to the foot of my bed and I think it was literally just standing there. But then it goes to the other side of my bed (to my back) and lays on the very edge of my bed for maybe 5 minutes. Then it gets up and starts going through my closet and I got so confused when I could hear it rustling through the hiding spot in it, but it did that for another 5 minutes until it came back around to the other side of my bed and started searching under my pillow or something. Only for a minute before it sat on the bed beside me (I’m not sure but I think I heard a sigh) for only a minute, then it actually lays right beside me, like I can feel it solidly against me. It stayed there for about 3 minutes, but then I heard my mom walking upstairs in her room, and that’s when I got really fucking scared, but that’s not even the worst part. 5 seconds after hearing my mom upstairs, another one walks up to me from my door and crouches down beside me. Then I be like “yo wtf”, turn my phone on for a light and nothing is there.

Edit: I forgot to mention how I am constantly being bothered by it now, literally rnrn

Update: another freaky ass fucking thing that happened was yesterday, my mom came into my room to pray (she’s Christian) for something I can’t remember. But the entire time I was sitting there with my eyes closed, I could feel one of them standing in front of me, pacing back and forth. Sometimes I can hear an actual footstep, this shit has been getting so fucked, whatever this ghost wants, it wants it bad because it reeeallyy isn’t scared in the slightest of me knowing it’s there (though that could be my own fault, as I haven’t been doing anything to ward it off, and maybe even been more welcoming).

,Thetruthishere," For context, I'm a girl and the major part of this story happened when I was in 8th grade. I  lived in the same house from the age of 4 until I turned 21. It was a  duplex, meaning there were two houses on the same  property, with a  large backyard. Our property manager had turned part of his garage into a  small bedroom and had rented it out to a man.

My  family moved in to the home closest to the backyard when I was 4. My  dad being the friendly guy he is, made friends with the man living in  the small bedroom across from our home. This man was older, maybe in his  late 40's or early 50's. Always reeked of alcohol and cigarettes, wore  glasses, and had crooked teeth. The works.

Over  the years, he'd watch me closely, in a creepy way. He'd only leave his  door cracked open, about an inch, and I'd see his glasses gleam as he  watched me play with friends or by myself. He would always try to tempt  me to come to him with money or candy.

As  I got older, I started inviting my middle school friends to my home. A  few of them would comment on the weird man staring at us. I remember a  time where I said ""He's staring at us again."" and one of my guy friends  responded with ""He's not staring at us, he's watching YOU.""

My best friend, and yes she is the same best friend I've been mentioning in my last two stories. We'll call her Karin.

Karin  and I had been super invested in Naruto, we'd always watch it on our  spare time together. One of the characters Jiraiya, was a super pervert  who would lurk around women, Naruto called him pervy sage. So we started  calling the creepy old man Pervy Sage as well. (Sorry Jiraiya.)

Late  one night maybe around 8pm or 9pm, when i was about 13 or 14, Karin and I were in my dining  room area, sitting at the computer with my dog on my lap. My parents  were at work, my older brothers were in their room(they share the master  bedroom). They were hanging out with their friends.

I  recall hearing my front door open but not thinking much of it. That's  until I smelled the stench of cigarettes and alcohol, we looked to our  left and saw him inside my home. But neither of us said anything, Karin  and I were both in shock. He walked up to us and stood behind me. He  began to play with my hair asking what we were doing. Karin and I just  sat there, not knowing what to say, he knew my parents weren't home. She  blurted out we were ordering pizza online and typed in Pizza Hut on the  search bar. She later told me if we ordered pizza a grown up would come  and we could tell him/her what was wrong.

The  man did not budge, he continued to play with my hair. Karin got up and  nervously said ""I'm gonna ask your brothers if they want anything on  their pizza"" and with that she ran to her right, straight down the  hallway, and bolted through my brothers' door.

I had just finalized the pizza purchase and heard her scream ""Pervy Sage is acting weird!""

The  man spoke only spanish, I doubt he knew what she said, but with that I  grabbed my dog and ran towards my brothers room and repeated it. ""Pervy  sage is acting weird!""

Both Karin  and I were blurting out how weird he weird was being and how he came in  uninvited. I can imagine, we both  looked hysterical. My brothers, told us to get the fuck out of their room.

I'm  not sure if they were trying to look cool in front of their friends but  I knew how they were, if I didn't do as they asked, I'd get beat up or  told off. Karin and I looked at each other sort of defeated, we closed  their bedroom door and stood in front of it for a second.

We looked back where we originally sat but the man was not there. Karin  and I ran to the kitchen, grabbed two knives and ran into my bedroom and  locked the door. She sat on the bed with my dog and I sat on the floor,  trying to listen or feel if he was walking around my house. My house  was old, it would easily shake when someone walked around, so I felt if I  sat on the floor I'd feel it if he were inside.

My  bedroom had two doors... One with a lock that connected to the hallway.  The other, with no lock, connected to my parents room, which was right  next to the front door of the house.

Karin  and I heard his footsteps in the living room once more then silence. We both  looked at each other in horror. We both rushed to the second door and  pushed against it just in time to stop him from opening it. The man  pushed for about 30 seconds before stopping. The moment he stopped Karin  and I took the opportunity to push a dresser into the door to barricade  it.

About  15 minutes of us sitting on my bed, knives in hand,  we heard the pizza guy arrive. With that the man was gone, back in his  hole of a bedroom, outside my home. We locked the front door and ate our  pizza.

We didn't call police,  because of where we lived, we thought 'who'd believe two kids?'. A few  days later Karin and I reported everything to our school counselor, she  was an amazing caring woman, she was always there for us no matter what  we needed, so we trusted her enough to tell her what had happened. She made a full report,  and interviewed us  both separately to make sure we weren't lying.

She called us both into her office the next day and let us know she had called police to report the incident but they  told her ""We cannot do anything until something happens.""

Karin was furious, ""are we supposed to be found dead in a ditch for them do something?"" I can still hear her saying this to this day.

Our  counselor called our parents to report the incident. Karin's parent's  didn't seem to care, their divorce was more important. My dad asked me  if it was true and said he'd talk to the guy. My brothers came to me  saying ""if he comes near you tell us."" all of a sudden they cared.

My  dad remained friends with the man. The man stopped talking to me for years but  never stopped watching. When I was 16, Karin and I were hanging out near  the front of the property, the man had ridden his bike near us and said  ""You're attitude has changed."" (in spanish) This was the first time he said anything to me since the event two to three years prior. So I told him ""I'm not a  kid anymore, I know what you are, and I can fight back."" Karin glared at  him. He moved away shortly after that.

Karin  and I lost touch after he moved away, we both went to different high  schools and for the first two years we tried our hardest to remain in  contact, but we grew apart. That and her mom had her moving from place  to place after the divorce.

I grew up with trust issues around men due to that man. Just something I'm slowly trying to get over.

,Thetruthishere,"Below is a recounting of a real-life strange encounter my boyfriend and I had recently with what we both believe to have been a being that was not of this world in our apartment building. The story has not been embellished for dramatic effect in that I have not changed any of the details of the story to make it a better story, it is as true as I remember it to have happened to us. 
Discussion is welcomed. I hope you enjoy the tale! 




The familiar chime rang out, reverberating off the cement block walls as the elevator doors slid open. In the months we’d been living in the building, we’d only rarely shared the elevator with anyone else, but this time there was a woman on the lift already. She didn’t acknowledge our presence as we got on the elevator with her, she just stood there in the back corner, expressionless. I reached in front of her to press the button to take us down to the ground floor. The buttons for the 5th and 6th floors were illuminated as though they had already been pressed, as was the button for the basement. The doors slid closed and the elevator cables began to creak and groan as they pulled us upwards. The elevator stopped on the 5th floor and with a chime the silence filling the space was broken and the doors opened. There was no one there waiting to get on, and the woman in the corner made no move to exit the elevator. I looked over my shoulder at Matt; we shared a look of mild confusion, but didn’t think much of it. Perhaps the woman had accidentally pressed the buttons for both floors; a simple mistake. After a moment the doors closed again and we were hoisted the rest of the way up to the 6th floor. Another chime and the doors slid open. Again, no one was there; again the woman made no move to exit. Nervous laughter escaped me as I glanced over at the woman. She remained expressionless, her eyes almost lifeless; she looked dull, there was no lustre to her hair or skin. She was elderly and wore a long winter coat, a fur hat, and boots - clean and fashionable, but dated. She hadn’t moved an inch since we stepped onto the elevator 2 floors ago.

The story has not been embellished for dramatic effect in that I have not changed any of the details of the story to make it a better story, it is as true as I remember it to have happened to us. 
Discussion is welcomed. I hope you enjoy the tale! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The familiar chime rang out, reverberating off the cement block walls as the elevator doors slid open. In the months we’d been living in the building, we’d only rarely shared the elevator with anyone else, but this time there was a woman on the lift already. She didn’t acknowledge our presence as we got on the elevator with her, she just stood there in the back corner, expressionless. I reached in front of her to press the button to take us down to the ground floor. The buttons for the 5th and 6th floors were illuminated as though they had already been pressed, as was the button for the basement. The doors slid closed and the elevator cables began to creak and groan as they pulled us upwards. The elevator stopped on the 5th floor and with a chime the silence filling the space was broken and the doors opened. There was no one there waiting to get on, and the woman in the corner made no move to exit the elevator. I looked over my shoulder at Matt; we shared a look of mild confusion, but didn’t think much of it. Perhaps the woman had accidentally pressed the buttons for both floors; a simple mistake. After a moment the doors closed again and we were hoisted the rest of the way up to the 6th floor. Another chime and the doors slid open. Again, no one was there; again the woman made no move to exit. Nervous laughter escaped me as I glanced over at the woman. She remained expressionless, her eyes almost lifeless; she looked dull, there was no lustre to her hair or skin. She was elderly and wore a long winter coat, a fur hat, and boots - clean and fashionable, but dated. She hadn’t moved an inch since we stepped onto the elevator 2 floors ago. She didn’t shift her weight from one side to the other, she didn’t adjust her grip on the bag she was carrying, she didn’t make a sound. A sense of dread washed over me - I didn’t want to spend another second on the lift with this strange woman. I wanted to exit the elevator right there on the 6th floor and take the stairs down.

,Thetruthishere,"Hello all!

As I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/f9ziia/will_soon_possess_a_haunted_dollsuggestions_for/) I now possess a potentially haunted doll. I promised I would post an update, and so, here we are. 

Doll in containment: [Here](https://i.imgur.com/EoP73VW.jpg)

It's under 24/7 watch. The camera does motion detection, and also takes a still image every single minute. It alerts me to motion and also records 15 seconds before, and after the motion as a separate video.

Currently, he resides in a large glass jar. After speaking to a few different people, it was suggested I start small. Glass is made from sand, so a fully glass jar is ""akin to burying it"". For now, I felt that was a good start, and will increase as needed.

This was also suggested because if I start strong, the entity may see that as a challenge.

The two black boxes, one on each side: These are mini EMF detectors.

They glow blue as seen in this short video: [Video](https://i.imgur.com/OVnnApp.mp4)

They are pretty sensitive and will react to EMF even from across the room. For example, when my cat runs across the carpet, that little bit of static will make them react if they are within about 5 feet. They glow brighter, the stronger the EMF.

These two pictures should explain how they are helping with the investigation:

[One](https://i.imgur.com/jd5PbMJ.jpg)

[Two](https://i.imgur.com/vpe4jvZ.jpg)

In the first image, you can see the constant small glow they give off while next to the jar. Not even touching the jar.

The second image shows one of them moved to the wall, away from the jar by two inches, and is no longer glowing. You will see the left one is still glowing. I have a bunch of these that I use to make a circle, or other design, around investigation areas. It helps track the movement of entities/energy.

I have done one Spirit Box session, and one EVP session so far, but have received no contact. I did a reading with a separate EMF detector, and it gave me a strong reading at first, but then it stopped a moment or two later.

I will, of course, update more in the future when/if anything else happens.

No nightmares so far!

Someone below asked about my prior experiences, and I uploaded some old EVPs and recordings I did. Here is the comment, and my reply with the link:

&gt;Damn how was living in a haunted house? Did it scare you? And what kind of voice was there? Those over nights sound intense. That would’ve been fucking awesome. And damn that’s dope how you got the doll. Do they have big over night hunt events? So many questions lol.

You know, it's kinda funny really. My friends and family kept telling me all these ghost stories, and I just never really experienced anything, despite being a believer. I never heard the footsteps, I never saw things move.

In 2008, we had a kitchen fire, and the second floor took so much smoke damage that my brother and I ended up having to sleep in the living room. The back wall had a large opening for the kitchen, that went along to the bathroom as well. As I was laying there, late one night, I saw a swirling mass of colors exit the boarded up kitchen, walk along the wall, and into the bathroom.

At that time I was experimenting with astral projection, and hypnogogic imagery, so I assumed it was that. The next morning, my brother asked me ""Did you see the lady in white?""

I asked him what he meant, and he said he woke up around 3am, and saw a woman in a white dress come out of the kitchen, walk down the wall, and into the bathroom.

----

After that, I started hearing little noises, little taps. I heard my name said a few times. I started recording, and caught EVPs, two of which are my name, and two being longer sentences. One saying my name freaked the ever living fuck out of me, so I stopped recording. It wasn't that it was my name, but HOW it was said.

So, I was using an app called 'sleepbot' that records noises while you sleep. Fun for hearing you snore, ya know?

In order to use it, you leave it on the bed around your head, and if you move, it captures that as well.

Around 5am, I was half awake, and I swore I heard something. I rolled over, grabbed my phone, and hit stop. I then hit play on the last 30 seconds...it was my name, but it WASN'T an EVP in my opinion. I hear the entity take a deep breath, and say my name, before drawing more air through it's teeth. But as it says my name, wind goes over the microphone of of the phone. Just a foot from my head. (Uploaded the recordings to drive for your enjoyment: [EVP/Recordings](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1YEciZ0QwCqsjP_xdegOIuaSuvq3Ui_YH) (Uploaded to Mega.nz as well since some are having issues downloaded from google drive) [Here](https://mega.nz/#!Kt8FFaiL!IqFp9_Nx4MJZmfJQQtcCcfBWXItwTP9_KZPLMVyD4d8)

I heard it, and immediately got the fuck up. Ended up spending the rest of the morning in the kitchen smoking with all the lights on. I stopped recording after that, as it was clear I was getting too close.

After my experiences years later in bank repossession work, I renewed my interest.

To answer the final question, yes, both of those do public and private ghost hunts.",t2_bekyn,False,,0,False,The Doll Has Arrived...Follow up as promised!,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,pic,0,False,t3_fd57z5,False,dark,,public,647,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Picture/Evidence,False,647,,False,,1583348163.0,,[],{},,True,,1583313811.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Hello, I am once again coming back to this sub with something relating to dreams (lol). Trying to figure out if anyone has theories or similar experiences regarding something that happened to me this morning.

For context, I was sleeping in later than usual (my only class of the day being at 3), and had just gone back to sleep at around 9 AM. I don't know if I could call this sleep paralysis, but I could feel that I was neither really asleep nor awake when I heard a small knock on my door. I didn't — or wasn't able to — reply, and then the door opened. In my half awake half asleep state this didn't seem too weird, since my mom has been on sick leave for the past two weeks for a surgery, and so it was plausible that she'd check on me. I couldn't really move or open my eyes properly, but I wasn't scared. The person came up to the side of my bed, and I remember them staying there for a bit in silence, before they gently kissed my forehead and left. After that, I slept normally, but this all felt very vivid and I could remember it clearly as I woke up.

Again, my mom was home with me that morning, so I later asked her if she'd been in my room or if i'd dreamed that, and she said she hadn't. I considered the fact that she might have been too embarrassed to admit it, but i'm honestly not sure? It could have just been a very vivid dream, but i'm not sure about that either. It just felt real and vivid, and I remember it very clearly, more than most other dreams. Could it be a strange form of sleep paralysis (I've never heard of ""positive"" sleep paralysis before).

,Thetruthishere,"About 9 years ago, I'd usually have to go to an extra English class on Tuesday and Thursday. On the way there was an abanded building mixing with a feildwith of tall grass, a bunch of big trees and dense bushes.

I slept not long after that bc I got so tired then woke up a little before 4:00 a.m. I’m scrolling through reddit when suddenly I’m hit with this immense fear.

I go to the living room bc I can’t stand being in the last room anymore and plus my sister was also sleeping in the living room and there was only us 2 and her 4 little kiddos. 

I keep feeling this fear like something is waiting for just the right moment to jump scare me and I’m seriously thinking I should commit suicide cause that’s how scared I was. I want to cry, or wake my sister up but if she fell back asleep it would only scare me even more.  I can’t go back to sleep either bc every time I close my eyes it’s like the presence gets stronger and I feel like I’m going to die. I would have fallen asleep easily laying on my back but I deal with sleep paralysis so there’s just no way.

I’m scared but don’t know what to do. I think about climbing out the window and walking home but it was so dark. 
I decide to wait til it gets light outside maybe I’ll be more comfortable in closing my eyes. 

I keep hearing house noises that makes my heartbeat pick up pace. Shadows I see from the sides of my eyes that make me wish I could just be dead already. 

My stomach is hurting and I’m trying to hold in my insides cause I don’t want to go to the bathroom and puke. 

In all the fear is everywhere and I feel so little against it.

When it starts to lighten up outside and it’s close to the kiddies waking up I start to feel comfortable and let my guard down. Bad mistake, I start to hear this weird sound like something heavy being dragged. I look around trying to figure out where it’s coming from when all of a sudden the blanket that covers the front door (bc I live in a cold area and it’s winter here) pushes up and the front door opens. I swear to god my soul left my body at that moment, I’m so scared but I go close the door then go lay next to my sister under the blanket til she wakes up, when she does I go straight to sleep.

Later that day after I wake up my sister told me Branden a.k.a “big so” passed away, I don’t even know the guy but apparently he passed away of suicide downing bottles of pills.

So Ive said this before please forgive my structsring with writing.

During the summer after finishing my freshman year a few buddies and I were just hanging out all day into the next morning(around 3 to 4 am) we decided to stay at my place that night to play games and watch tv. So arounf 3 or 4 am we decide to head down to the basement to sleep since we had a reclinging couch and a love seat. Well I was ready to sleep but my 2 friends were not so they kept talking and trying to get me into the conversation. So while we sat in out spot reclined we heard pounding upstairs like someone was running down the stairs, then a loud bang, and a scream. The scream didnt sound like anyone in the house which made this even more weird. We shot up from our spot and all looked at each other for a few seconds before we all said ""did you hear that?"". I pointed out that it didnt sound like my Dad but it didnt sound like someone broke in either so we rush upstairs to see what happened. Nothing was there or moved out of place so we freaked out and ran to my room just confused. We eventually passed out right away and the next morning my friend Aaron and I told my mother what happened. She went from it was probably one of the animals but when we told her it couldnt have been it then turned into it must have been your father. So I pointed out if it was my Dad you would have heard him get up and then go back upstairs which no one heard. He had an average body type during this time and id maybe an inch smaller than me you would have heard him go back up stairs.

Since that was shorter than my last post Ill give you guys another short story. During my JR year of high school so a few years later I had 2 friends over on a school night. These 2 were like family to us so my Mom was aleays cool with it as long as we were home on time and in bed at a decent time. So my friend Aaron who lived with us was up in my room studying and doing home work while my friend Orlando and I were in the living room. Orlando was watching TV while I was on the computer trying to get a game running on the computer. Orland shuts off the TV and says ""Im going to head upstairs man"" so I tell him ""wait up Im going to shut this off"". I was secretly afraid to shut off everything downstaors because of how creepy the house was at night which resulted in me shutting everything off and running upstairs. So as I stand up we hear through the vents someone yelling. Like an actual person yelling not like air blowing through the vent. I swear it sounded like my name being called my friend claims he just heard a yell. He looks at me and nopes out while I press the power button the pc and run up stairs.

,Thetruthishere,"To preface this, I'm pretty sure the area my friend lives in has occultists because we've had a few strange run ins while out in the wooded suburbs. We just try to ignore strange happenings but also tempt fate a bit which is why we went out walking at night on Friday the 13th. There aren't too many streetlights and sometimes the sidewalks abruptly end so it was dark enough that walking or driving around would require use of a flashlight or headlights (especially to avoid deer). 
Anyway since it was the weekend and we were bored high schoolers at the time, we decided the nearby elementary school would be empty this late at night and we could mess around on the playground. We had an uneventful 20 minute walk over and jumped a medium fence into the playground. Another 20 yards or so further was the front of the school. The front face of the school had a looped road off the main road we walked on, and the only lights on were the outdoor ones on the school's entrance. The front of the school was empty when we walked to the playground, and we sat on the swings talking for half an hour before I noticed there was a cop car sitting outside the school front.
I pointed it out to my friend and she froze.
It was silent outside all night. Neither of us heard the car pull up. The angle the swings were at meant that a car pulling up would've cast it's headlights right on us, which we would've also noticed, but there were no lights. No other cars had passed by either. The car was parked there silently in the dark with only the school's front lights on it. Everything felt wrong about it, it was even an older model car that the county doesn't use anymore. It was kinda hard to see in the dark, but it looked like there was a lone pale figure in the driver's seat with no facial features. A completely smooth face.

,Thetruthishere,"So, In Canada, We have a scouts system similar to the US. Our System by level is Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Ventures. This happened during Cubs. 

So, there was this house on the property of the camp. Beautiful house, nice wooden smell, it was great. During this time, all the troops around us, gathered for a weekend up at the house. There were maybe 6-7 troops gathered, we would be doing wooden car racing, etc. 

The house was split into two rooms, one for males, other for females, and there was a closet doors connected to each room. At the time, there was maybe 10-20 guys in one room, and maybe 10-15 females. We would be sleeping on the floors with our sleeping bags. 
After brushing, me and the guys went back to the guys room. We were talking and one of the kids said that this place was haunted, and that the closet that leads into the girls section was where someone was hanged. 

Now, I’m not gonna lie, I always had a strange feeling of the doorway. So much in fact, that I specifically put my sleeping bag across the other side of the room. There was also an air vent there, that I was afraid as well, so I then moved it into the middle, even if I had to sleep in between two guys, I didn’t mind it.

That night, after the counslers shushed us to sleep, cause you know guys, we talk for hours on end if we don’t get told to sleep.

It was around maybe, 4:30. I awoke, my head facing towards the closet, when I notice something going down. The closet door, was slowly opening. I was kinda stunned, girls shouldn’t be peeping on guys. That’s when I see a shadow, no bigger than 6’. It was crazy tall for it’s size. Now, best I can describe from memory, is like the colour Vanta Black (Google it). It was very blurry, but crisp until the middle. It slowly inched it’s way across the wooden floor boards. No sound, nothing. It just silently passed each kid as it went by. I didn’t want this thing to see me, so I turned my head. It passed more kids, the more it went down. I was now trembling. I didn’t know what it wanted. It kept moving slowly, passing a few kids ahead of me, and then it happened. 

The more it got closer, the more I felt dread. Not only did I feel dread, but I felt the air getting colder. And not just the physical feeling cold, it felt cold in my insides. The air got more dry and cold, like Liquid Nitrogen. The greatest amount of that feeling happened when it passed me. I was maybe a few feet to the door, so when it went to the other entrance I was at, I’m not sh*tting you this, it was LITERALLY TURNING THE DOORKNOB. It pulled the door open, and slowly exited, before, strangely enough, shut the door behind itself.

That morning, We were getting up from bed, and walked down the rickity old steps. One of the kids said “Did you guys see that shadow last night”, and maybe 4 kids eyes widened. We all blurted “YES”. We talked about it for a short while, and let’s just say, after that experience.

,Thetruthishere,"When a strange or an unexplained thing happens it usually lasts only a moment or perhaps only a few minutes and as the weeks, months and years pass by you're no longer certain of what you have actually witnessed, if anything at all. The story that I want to tell however is one where the unexplained has lasted a whole night, so the experience is unpleasantly fresh in my mind even though it happened more that two decades ago. Perhaps smarter people than me will be able to come up with a rational explanation, or maybe there will be someone who had similar experiences.

It happened in the late 90s when I was 13 years old. My grandfather, who lived in another town, has fallen ill and my parents had to leave in a hurry to assist my grandma. I was left to my own devices, and as any teenager my age I was more than happy to be alone with all the computer games I could play. At the time we were living in a small two bedroom apartment, with a dog that looked scary, but in reality was the kindest and gentlest animal.

I spend the whole day playing video games. By the time I would usually go to bed I got a call from my father telling me that grandpa died. He told me that they will be staying in the other town to arrange the funeral. I got upset and cried for a while. I didn't want to go to bed so I went to the kitchen and cooked a frozen pizza. It was almost midnight by the time I finished eating. I decided to watch some TV thinking that perhaps it will help me fall asleep. As I was changing channels I stumbled upon some porn. Being a teenager with no easy access to porn, my horniness overcame any sadness and I spend some time masturbating. After I was done I took a shower and went to bed.

As I was going to bed I called the dog into the room since she would just scratch the door if I were to leave her outside. I closed the bedroom door and cozied up under the blanket. This is when I began to hear strange sounds from the kitchen, with which my bedroom shared a wall. The sounds were exactly what you would hear when you place kitchenware on a table. For example when you put a cup on a counter-top, or a knife on a plate, only louder. I could distinctively hear those sounds, and there was no mistake that the sounds were coming from the kitchen.

The dog heard the sounds too, I looked at her and she was starring at the wall intently. Things started to get much noisier. Within minutes I could hear ruckus from beyond the wall. Plates hitting other plates, metal clanking, hollow sounds when something hits a wooden table and many more in a bizarre cacophony. I was literally paralyzed with fear, for the first half an hour I wouldn't dare to move. During that time the dog became livid and began barking, not at the wall but at the door.

As time passed I had ample time to reassure myself that this wasn't a dream, and that this was really happening. The dog kept barking at the door and I finally gathered some courage to move. I sat up and after staring at the wall for a while, I looked at the door. It looked as if I was safe, and I was certainly glad that the dog was with me in the room. During the next hours the commotion continued while I was able to get up from the bed and slowly approach the door. After a while I was holding the doorknob, but I never gathered up enough courage to actually open the door. It wasn't just my fear: when I looked at the dog I could see what I can only describe as terror in her eyes as she kept barking.

It took me some time to return and sit on the bed. An hour perhaps, since I was still afraid to move too quickly, partially because I didn't want to miss any of the noise coming closer, and partially because I was too afraid that I might attract attention of whatever it was that was making it. Once I was sitting I looked out of the window, but I couldn't see anything, it was pitch dark. I decided that the best strategy for me would be to sit quietly and wait for the morning.

As the dawn came I could hear the noise die out slowly just as it came. The noises became weak and rare enough that I could hear the building's elevator in the distance. And very soon the dog calmed down. Just sitting looking at me looking at her. I waited for about another hour and decided that it was probably safe to come out. When I entered the kitchen I couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. Everything was as I remembered it.

To this day I don't know what exactly was making that noise. All I know it was coming from the kitchen, it was strong and it lasted all night. I tried really hard to come up with a rational explanation. My line of thinking was that perhaps someone has broken in to the apartment. But the problem with that theory was that the front door, and the balcony door were both locked, there were no signs of break-in. And besides why would anybody break-in just to make noise, without taking anything and without leaving a trace.

The closest paranormal explanation is poltergeist. The problem is that I don't really believe in paranormal, so that “explanation” was never enough for me.

These events started 5 years ago, this entry took place around a year from the beginning. I am no longer under the impression I am the star of a reality show and everyone keeping it a secret. I only know I am the host for some sort of parasite in my mind/sole. I have sought medical help in the past and been through that, but I appreciate everyone's concern. Through posting this I have finally come into contact with some people who have been or are going thru the same thing I am ,down to the different methods employed on me. My goal through writing these post is that anyone else going through similar events can know they aren't alone, ultimately we can collaborate and demystify this. \n\nThis is my fifth entry, I got ahead of myself on my fourth entry so the events and experiences that I am writing happened before my last entry. If you are just finding this and have not read any of my previous posts I believe I am the star of a reality show that everyone on the planet is in on, including my family,friends literally everyone. I do cling to the possibility I may be mentally ill, I almost hope for it. I move into a new apartment and hope for the best, no more neighbors spying on me, contacting my coworkers, family, friends ect. Unfortunately I am in for a huge disappointment, This new apartment is equipped with new technology, and it is everywhere. Now my sleep is interrupted constantly,my dreams are being manipulated and new methods and tactics are being used. The voices never stop and there are more voices with different sometimes electronic tones. The tone and tempo of there sentences are very strange, but it doesn't seem like they are strange for being stranges sake.  When I first started to hearing them I remember thinking  to myself this is  what you would use to brainwash or hypnotise someone. I later learned these methods were associated with NLP, or nero linguistic programming. They also started using tones to induce me into a trance, then things got wierd, I could write 10 pages on all of the different methods that were used, if you are going thru something similar message me and i can elaborate or we can trade stories. I could go on about every detail but my last entry was seven pages and I don't have that time. . As a side note I've been in  contact with more than a few people that are going through this, so your not alone. Anyways I have transitioned from being heckled by passer bys neighbors everyone to hearing things all the time in every sound possible, the wind electricity anything with a sound produces voices, I am told its programming. I could and can only speculate but it seemed they were  programming themselves into all surrounding and ambient sound. At  times I would enter what I called dual mode, basically my mouth would move with the words I heard them speaking, they  called this parroting. My mind was feeling foggy , it always did but now it felt more sluggish these voices didnt go away, how were  they following me to this level with this new pinpoint accuracy? They were making up songs and constantly singing. I had this overwhelming thought of I”have to do something” the thought was over whelming  unrelenting, and on a fast loop. I later realized  that among other things it was possible  to implant streams of thought in my mind. For now at this point the only thing that makes sense is everyone on the planet is participating in a reality show Im the star of collaborating to mess with me. Its the only possible explanation, I may be schizophrenic ,but its a very small possibility in my mind. I try to convince myself I am but I keep getting bombarded with new information and experiences Im just not intelligent enough to make up. Anyway I have moved into this new apartment and my sunny optimism of a fresh start has been shit on, on top of the reality show continuing Im being hit harder and wondering how my life has turned into this. Although I've accepted everyone on the planet is in  on it, as a defense mechanism I think maybe everyone isn't participating. One day I traded in my car and got a brand new one. On top of being excited for the new car I thought that maybe there was a possibility this car had not been hacked yet, I would finally have a car where I would be free of any cameras, microphones or speakers being hacked. I was in for a disappointment as soon as I drove off of the dealership I heard the voices, this put me in a very fowl mood I felt so hopeless so helpless to do anything or escape, truly everyone on the planet was in on this, It did take along time for the dealership to fill up the tank and put on the temp tags they must have installed cameras and hacked the bluetooth. I knew I was going to be unpleasant so I let my family do what we had planned for the evening without me and stayed home. My neighbors were badgering me through the hidden speakers and watching me through there hidden cameras and I had enough, I couldn't kill anyone and go to prison, if my life could be made hell like this on the outside i could only imagine what their reach would extend to on the inside of a prison. I decided to kill myself. I sat inside the bathroom on the toilet and had a razor every time I would start cutting they would start talking, at times they would say don't do it, don't leave your family, then they would say whats taking you soo long? “Your just trying to make everyone feel bad for you”. After a couple of hours of trying to cut and it hurting and being tired of the audience I decided Im done, I wont be a spectacle and I wont do this in front of everyone to be broadcast  over these hidden cameras. I decided I was going to kill myself where no one can see, I was going to find a tall bridge and jump off. I called a cab, when it arrived I turned off my phone so my location could not be tracked. I had the cab drop me about 20 miles away near a high exit ramp. I debated walking up the ramp to jump but decided I would look odd walking the opposite direction of traffic on a tollway and may get arrested and my plan would be foiled and Id be in jail to boot. New plan, I would walk until I saw a high building I could access,climb up and jump from there. I walked about 20 minutes heard and no voices, I was successful I had lost them. I finally found a building that was under construction and easily accessible. I accessed the stairwell and climbed to the top I think it was 10 stories, It would definitely do the trick.  I walked to the edge and looked down,  I pulled my wallet and phone out of my pocket. I turned my phone on and tried to write my wife a message telling her I loved her and I was sorry but it was at 1 percent so it was the most pathetic suicide message ever, “killilng myself, phones about to die love you sorry”, I put my phone and wallet on the ledge and prepared to lean foward enough to lose my balance and fall, then I hear “do it hurry up” I look where the voices are coming from and theres a crane doing construction on a nearby building. Then I see construction workers on the building the crane is working on encouraging me to jump. What the fuck why are they operating a crane at night and why are they such dicks? I go to the otherside of the building facing the tollway nobody yelling or looking, then I hear all of the familiar voices that have been tormenting me, having a blast using there voice filters.” How the fuck did you find me” “cant you let me do this in private? “  “No, we wanna watch, plus your not even crying you're not gonna do it. “ , and if you are you better hurry” “you are the perfect definition of a loser” why don't you stop being a loser?” “fuck you, you are the loser” the rest is a back and forth of blah blah blah. I finally asked why? A familiar female voice said “power” this pissed me off so much I decided i was gonna tough this out and one day show them power, I was going to have revenge. I walked for 2 hours freezing with no jacket looking like an insane person yelling at the air. I finally got to a gas station and bought a charger to charge my phone. I went to the bathroom and looked at myself I looked disheveled and by wrist were bleeding. My phone charged and I called my wife to pick me up. She was so surprised to hear my voice after the message I sent her. Anyways now my mind was on the fact that they tracked me down so fast and the voices came out of no where, I came to the conclusion they were using very small drones, looking back all of these  answers and rationalizations I came up with were a self defense mechanism. I couldn't accept or entertain the possibility that through technology, spiritualism whatever something was inside me, cohabitating with me.

So this happened a few years ago, but the memory stuck with me and I remember it clear as day. I’m Vietnamese and my family celebrates Lunar New Year every year which is a holiday where we exchange red envelopes as a tradition. (The red envelopes contain money and it’s for good luck for the new year). 

My grandma does this lottery thing where she puts a 5 or 10 dollar bill in every red envelope, but only ONE of them has a 100 dollar bill, which was the jackpot. I have quite a few cousins so maybe around like 10 or 15 (my grandma was holding like 30 envelopes tho because my aunts and uncles also get to choose one) and we line up from youngest to oldest. I was one of the older cousins so I’m never in the front.

When it was my turn to choose an envelope, there was this one envelope I just KNEW for certain that it had the 100 dollar bill. I can’t even describe the feeling. I just had this deep certainty about it. If u asked me to bet my life on it during that moment, I would have (just shows that I knew 100%). I chose it, no hesitation and I opened it up a few minutes later. It was the 100 dollar bill.

I tried to play it off as maybe it was just a rlly lucky coincidence, but I still couldn’t find a reason on how I just KNEW? I didn’t see any of the red envelopes before hand at all. Anyway, every year after that incident, I’ve been trying to see if I could get certainty feeling again and I haven’t had that same feeling since. I still have no rational explanation for it.

,Thetruthishere,"So for a bit of context; I live in West-North-Western Georgia (US). I’m in the middle of nowhere, on a weird off-on-it’s-own cul de sac with houses on only one side and woods all around it. Other than the cul de sac houses are all over 100yards(m) away from each other. The woods are thick and begin about 30ft (10m) away from our house. 
The area is not known to have any bears (those are far further north), no wolves or coywolves, and our coyotes are rather small and very shy. As are the deer. I even contacted our local DFW and they said there was nothing bigger than coyote and deer out here. 

I take the dogs out into the yard to pee 2-3 times after dark. I put them on a split leash and normally wander around the yard for a bit to let them find a spot, but that has come to an end. I don’t dare step off the patio now. 

For the past few weeks, my dogs have been acting really odd when it comes to going out at night. They want to go out front, but since my landlord doesn’t want me to let them ruin the front lawn I have to drag them to the backdoor. And they refuse to step out most times, especially my younger dog. They want to stay close to the house, and are always VERY alert. 
They will lunge towards the woods at random, starting to bark like crazy. I would normally call this off as wildlife, but it’s been getting really weird. And normally if there is something like a rabbit, they are very easily shushed and redirected. 

I’ve heard whatever it is walking, right at the edge of the woods. It doesn’t have the typical 4-beat walk of a 4 legged animal, and it is not scared of my dogs. I can hear it’s heavy by the way the leaves scrunch and the branches crack. It is not scared of the dogs, or me shouting, and it does not leave. If it’s there at 9 pm, it’ll be there at midnight, and it’ll be there at 2am. Always at the edge of the woods. And I can feel a difference myself, too. Even when I go out alone (I had to grab a patio chair the other day, for example) it’s almost like I can feel when it’s there. I’m normally very relaxed in my yard, even at night. But I’ll get that backshuddering, heartracing get-in-get-in-get-in feeling. 

My dogs will even go crazy when inside, seemingly at random. Standing at the windows barking out to the woods. 

I’ve been out there during the day, looking for things like fur scraps, scat, stag, or clawmarks, etc. Nothing turned up. Not even footsteps (thought it would have been a person, perhaps)

I’m trying really hard to find a reasonable excuse for what might have been happening. But I keep running into dead ends. 

I’m an immigrant, I’m not too knowledgeable on the local stuff... “folklore” or whatever you wanna call it. But holy hell this scares the life out of me.

,Thetruthishere,"This is my written encounter with Robert the Doll.

Detailed as follows is the meeting and later encounter with the spirit or entity attached to the doll. Then an explanation of any bad luck that has happened.

Everything that happened is real. I experienced it while awake. I was on no substances that could cause a hallucination and have never partaken in anything that would be considered a drug or illegal substance. You choose what you believe but my eyes saw what they saw and I heard what I heard. 

I went on vacation with my family to Key West a few years ago. We decided to go to the museum to visit and I honestly did want to go see Robert in person because I had read about him before. I took a picture at one point that had him in the background. It was not a direct picture in front of him. This was enough to get his attention though but I did delete the picture later and it no longer exists. 

When he visited me (this means the entity moved from the doll) I heard laughing and turned on the light to see the metal pull cord to the fan (it was on but I had never seen it move the chain prior to this) spinning around like someone had pulled it or was messing around with it. This was the extent of any interaction I have had with the entity away from the doll itself. Nothing happened while I was at the museum or during the day up to this point. 

Since taking the picture and the visit I have not had anything that I would call unfortunate or terrible in a life-ruining way. I have a nice job that I like now and life has been normal. I think there is a chance Robert may know when someone makes a mistake or is intentionally going up and taking his picture with full knowledge of what they are doing.

This was the extent of any interaction I have had with the entity away from the doll itself. Nothing happened while I was at the museum or during the day up to this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking the picture and the visit I have not had anything that I would call unfortunate or terrible in a life-ruining way. I have a nice job that I like now and life has been normal. I think there is a chance Robert may know when someone makes a mistake or is intentionally going up and taking his picture with full knowledge of what they are doing. Basically, if you play with fire, in this case, you will probably get burned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m willing to answer any questions to my best ability.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"When I was 10 my family and I went to New Mexico to visit relatives. It was February and freezing. We were staying at my aunts house, a small bungalow. Me and my family, my mom, dad, and sister, were sleeping in the loft. It was just one room with a full size mattress on the floor which my parents slept in and me and my sister slept on the floor in sleeping bags. The hole time we were there I felt like I was in a dream. When we went out to town it was normal I felt real but whenever we went back to that house I felt like I was watching a movie. Like i was there but at the same time I wasn’t. 
      
I was never a big believer in the supernatural as a kid but this changed my outlook forever. I still dont have a definitive side i stand on but i question everything now. Just to give some backstory I don’t remember much from when I was younger and most of the memories I do have are choppy and faded but this i remember clear as day. As far as my dreams go i dont have nightmares like ever and even if i do there weird pointless ones that aren’t scary but just have a feeling of fear if the makes sense. All my dreams are weird they never make any sense, like how you feel on shrooms, those are my dreams. 
   
When i went to bed that night i fell asleep pretty easily which doesn’t happen often. Okay now for the actual dream. I was in the backyard on the hill that was covered in snow. A young girl somewhere from the age of 9-11 was standing in front of me. She was wearing a long white night gown, she was pale, not unnaturally pale just very white i guess, almost glowing, she had dirty blonde hair and blue eyes, she had freckles but not all over her face only faintly spread from her cheeks to her forehead. She didn’t have shoes which i found strange until i realized she wasn’t touching the ground. She was hovering an inch or so above. 
   
She reached out her hand motioning me to follow her so i did. As we walked up the snowy hill to the edge of the woods i noticed footprints in the snow just one set leading into the woods but none coming out. They were big bootprints probably a mens 12 or so boot. When i looked at the footprints for a brief second i could see the man that made them. He was around 6’2 and stocky, he had a chubby face, a beard and a button nose, he was wearing a black beanie and a thick winter flannel type jacket, maybe wool? with a button up and a long sleeve underneath, he had old worn jeans on and construction type boots. I only saw him for a second but it felt like forever. The weird thing was i couldn’t see his eyes they were there i just couldn’t focus on them. 
  
Then we got to the edge of the woods and the girl looked at me and continued to go deeper into the woods. We were only walking for a second but i look around and i couldn’t see the edge of the trees anymore when i turn around we are in a small clearing in the middle of the woods about the size of a small bathroom if that make sense. There are these huge logs in the shape of a rectangle that the girl is walking on (more like hovering on) and there are these white fairy lights strung up on the trees also in the shape of a rectangle. I climb up on the logs and look at the girl, she looks down into the middle of them and goes from a happy little girl to sad almost like despair, i followed where here eyes went. It had to be like a 4 foot drop to the ground where there was fresh dirt, no snow like someone had just covered in a hole. I look up at her and she looks at me with sadness in her eyes and i feel dreadful i look back down at the ground and theres a hole, about 5 feet long and 3 feet wide i couldn’t tell how deep it was but when i finally focused on the bottom there was what look to be a body wrapped in that clear plastic tarp stuff you put on the floor when your painting a room. I felt like my heart had fell to my stomach and the dread starts to become overwhelming. 
  
I wake up in the loft covered in sweat even though the room was freezing. I check the clock and its 4 am everyone else is sound asleep. I didn’t go back to sleep after that i just stayed up trying to think about anything else except what just happened. I never talked about until i was around 14 me and my mom were talking about how we had a lot of fun there and how we’d like to go back. We had just pull in the driveway and we were sitting in the car. I dont know why but i felt like i needed to tell her about the dream so i did i started crying and before i could finish the rest of the dream she finished it for me. She said she had the same one. That freaked me out even more. I’m 17 now and haven’t had a dream that vivd since. I have only told that story twice(to my mom and my best friend) and both times i’ve broken down into tears trying to get through it. I dont mean to cry i just feel so overwhelmed its hard to think.

You may need to know this to understand better. In chronos's findings time travel or temporal divergence as they call it is when someone travels into a parallel reality because you can not travel into your own past merely a similar parallel reality. If one opens a portal into a divergent timeline once the portal is closed the link is lost forever.


Recently I found this [site](http://www.chronos.ws) about time travel that states at the bottom for ""entertainment"" purposes only, but I find it makes to much sence to be just that. In particular the part on navigating timelines. Where it tells you how more advanced time travelers could enter our time line and secretly control events/history while none would be the wiser. I believe people from Orion star system threw the MIB have been doing just that. Well up until we discovered time travel and weeded them out of our timeline. This would have uimaginable gains and resources. The site also goes into how one would do that. 

I believe this would also make sense out of the Mandela Effect. 1.On this site it states that when a time traveler enters a divergent timeline or parrallel reality that there mere presence would have huge effects, not right away if they avoided making changes, but long term the future would look nothing like the future of the original timeline. This is explained on the site aswell. I'll touch on that, it's because there atoms and what makes up people or what ever else they bring into our timeline was never in that timeline, so by adding atoms and particles to a timeline it has drastic effects because of destiny and the law of causality.

1.Excerpt from site,
While some events, such as flipping a coin or rolling a die, may seem to be random, their outcomes are determined by the forces of nature. This can be illustrated by tracing the contributing causal forces of an event backwards in time:

When a coin is flipped, it lands tails-up. This is due not to random chance, but to forces acting on the coin, including air density and wind, local gravitational forces, the force and trajectory at which the coin was thrown, and the weight of the coin itself. While these and other factors may seem to be random and spontaneous, each force acting on the coin was in turn caused by another force. For example, the force with which the coin was thrown was determined by the neuro-muscular development of the person throwing it, which in turn was determined by the person's experience, diet, environment, and genetic makeup. The person's genetic makeup was determined by which genes were passed on from the parents, which were determined by when the parents conceived the child, which was determined by when the parents first met, which was determined by the geographic locations of the parents, which could be traced back through economic, political, geological, and evolutionary causal forces, which in turn can be traced back to the creation of Earth and the Solar system, which in turn was determined by the forces existing at the creation of the Universe. 

I'm confident this explains the Mandela effect because if time travelers entered our timeline there mere presence would change events. I still have my memories of my past, but my future from the point they entered my timeline would change leading to these changes we are seeing. (I have seen myself) The flip flop aspect could be explained by; If other time travelers (beside's Orion) from other star systems enter our reality there presence from the point they enter our reality after Orion did would have long term affects changing events again. 

Disclaimer: These are just my thoughts/opinions not facts. I wrote this for debate purposes only. To put it into the public consciousness to see what comes back, and what peoples thoughts are. Maybe it  will reach the right person and make them think a little, provoking good healthy constructive criticism. What are your thoughts PM me or comment please. I'm excited to see what they are.

Update:
 I found proof to back up my claim that this site is not that of entertainment purposes. I did a FOIA (freedom of information act) search on Chronos Technologies .inc the company that made this site. I found some very interesting things to say the least. The person that owns this companie Randall B.  Olsen also works for the United States Government in technology department and is responsible for a ton of technology advancements in our society and especially for space and space exploration. This would make sense that he developed technology that allowed temporal divergence. I've only scratched the surface (just started the research) and will report back when I have more.

Also I've found patients and other projects Chronos Technologies Inc. worked on using their developed technology.
Here is one such company they develope tech for.

In chronos&amp;#39;s findings time travel or temporal divergence as they call it is when someone travels into a parallel reality because you can not travel into your own past merely a similar parallel reality. If one opens a portal into a divergent timeline once the portal is closed the link is lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I found this &lt;a href=""http://www.chronos.ws""&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; about time travel that states at the bottom for &amp;quot;entertainment&amp;quot; purposes only, but I find it makes to much sence to be just that. In particular the part on navigating timelines. Where it tells you how more advanced time travelers could enter our time line and secretly control events/history while none would be the wiser. I believe people from Orion star system threw the MIB have been doing just that. Well up until we discovered time travel and weeded them out of our timeline. This would have uimaginable gains and resources. The site also goes into how one would do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this would also make sense out of the Mandela Effect. 1.On this site it states that when a time traveler enters a divergent timeline or parrallel reality that there mere presence would have huge effects, not right away if they avoided making changes, but long term the future would look nothing like the future of the original timeline. This is explained on the site aswell. I&amp;#39;ll touch on that, it&amp;#39;s because there atoms and what makes up people or what ever else they bring into our timeline was never in that timeline, so by adding atoms and particles to a timeline it has drastic effects because of destiny and the law of causality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Excerpt from site,
While some events, such as flipping a coin or rolling a die, may seem to be random, their outcomes are determined by the forces of nature. This can be illustrated by tracing the contributing causal forces of an event backwards in time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a coin is flipped, it lands tails-up. This is due not to random chance, but to forces acting on the coin, including air density and wind, local gravitational forces, the force and trajectory at which the coin was thrown, and the weight of the coin itself. While these and other factors may seem to be random and spontaneous, each force acting on the coin was in turn caused by another force. For example, the force with which the coin was thrown was determined by the neuro-muscular development of the person throwing it, which in turn was determined by the person&amp;#39;s experience, diet, environment, and genetic makeup. The person&amp;#39;s genetic makeup was determined by which genes were passed on from the parents, which were determined by when the parents conceived the child, which was determined by when the parents first met, which was determined by the geographic locations of the parents, which could be traced back through economic, political, geological, and evolutionary causal forces, which in turn can be traced back to the creation of Earth and the Solar system, which in turn was determined by the forces existing at the creation of the Universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m confident this explains the Mandela effect because if time travelers entered our timeline there mere presence would change events. I still have my memories of my past, but my future from the point they entered my timeline would change leading to these changes we are seeing. (I have seen myself) The flip flop aspect could be explained by; If other time travelers (beside&amp;#39;s Orion) from other star systems enter our reality there presence from the point they enter our reality after Orion did would have long term affects changing events again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:
 I found proof to back up my claim that this site is not that of entertainment purposes. I did a FOIA (freedom of information act) search on Chronos Technologies .inc the company that made this site. I found some very interesting things to say the least. The person that owns this companie Randall B.  Olsen also works for the United States Government in technology department and is responsible for a ton of technology advancements in our society and especially for space and space exploration. This would make sense that he developed technology that allowed temporal divergence. I&amp;#39;ve only scratched the surface (just started the research) and will report back when I have more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;ve found patients and other projects Chronos Technologies Inc. worked on using their developed technology.
Here is one such company they develope tech for.

,Thetruthishere,"I have never known what to make of what i am about to tell you. It was the strangest thing i have ever seen besides one other experience that i will tell in another post. Back in 2014 i went to a fireworks show on the fourth of july. Me and a guy i was dating were sitting down on the grass and the show was about to begin. We decided to get up and go smoke a joint behind the school where the fireworks were being held. I used to smoke weed everday years before but at the time i only smoked maybe once or twice a month. I am high but not crazy high i only hit the joint a few times and feel relaxed. After we smoke we go back to where all the other people are and the fireworks begin. After about 10 minutes the weirdest thing happens. There is this glowing ball of light that is far off in the distance. At first im thinking it is just a part of the firework but then this ball keeps getting closer. I ask the guy im with if he sees it and he does. At this point im intrigued and have never seen anything like this before and ive been going to see fireworks my entire life. I keep staring at the bright white glowing ball of what kind looks like fire but kind of doesnt. Its so hard to explain exactly what it looks like. Well it keeps getting closer and now it looks like its only 100 feet away. I am scared now and start closing my eyes because i dont know what i am seeing. I am wondering if it is because i am hallucinating from the weed. The guy i am with keeps saying what is that ive never seen anything like that. I turn my back on the ball of light bc im too scared to look at it and start asking people around me if they see it. They say yes they see it and im asking what is it and they dont know. Im thinking ok it isnt the weed this thing is real and what if it hurts us. I turn back around and it is super close and when i look at it its like im looking at it through 3D glasses. I can tell its like 30 feet away but at the same time it looks like it is right in front of my face. I ended up running back to the car and leaving.

So I walked in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I froze in there, everything went completely silent and the white light EXPLODED from nothing in the middle of my room in front of my face, way brighter than the light in the room already and more branched out more than I’d ever seen it before, kind of like big fingers of lightning. It surrounded me for a second, then retracted back into the space it had come from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I lost my shit and had a Blair Witch Project level freak out with snot and everything. My mom and I went for a drive after that. I haven’t seen the light that big since in my house, but sometimes I catch a little flash here and there but very rarely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year ago at the bar I work in, we were exchanging a few stories over drinks after hours. I told this story and one of my colleagues told me that it was called “house lightning” and it’s a common thing in Latvia, where she’s from. My boss also said he saw more or less the same flash in a forest a few decades ago, which incidentally is just across the road from where I grew up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone seen anything similar or know what it could be? I completely accept the possibility it could have been a psychological thing but I’m curious since other people have seen it too, and I haven’t been able to find anything about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: used to see a big scary lightning flash across the ceiling as a kid at the same time every night, want to know what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'new', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '6297446c-9edc-11e2-b612-12313d27e9a2', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qjxn', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#94e044', 'id': 'fbgmo2', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'necr0trix', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 27, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/Paranormal/comments/fbgmo2/the_white_flash/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/fbgmo2/the_white_flash/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 550954, 'created_utc': 1583000450.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",t3_fbgmo2,

Apologies for formatting also as I’m on my phone!



When I was younger, in my old house before we moved, I was terrified of the upstairs of my house for as long as I can remember. I can’t say when it started as it feels like it’s part of my earliest memories, we moved into the house when I was 2 and I believe it started pretty early on. This fear did not go away until I was 10, this is when we moved to a new house and all this fear that I had my whole life just vanished. I am almost 22 now and this fear has never returned in any house or situation so I believe it is tied to that house or something that happened there. 

When I say terrified I mean I could not be up there alone right up until we moved. We only had one bathroom which meant I used to hold it until someone would come with me. It became a chore for my mum and sister who had to come with me. If nobody came I just wouldn’t go until they did (I can hold for a long time and I wonder if this is why). When this happened at night, I would either wake up my sister who I shared a room with, or I would shout for my mum. This would sometimes go on for upwards of an hour. At times my sister just refused to get up as I can imagine it was frustrating and eventually she was just able to sleep through it. My mum would always wake up at some point and when she did she would take me to the toilet, which was literally outside of my room, and go back to sleep. I used to throw up a lot as a child and would often throw up on the end of my bed because I was just too afraid to leave my room and be in the bathroom alone and there was no time to wake my mum or sister. I know that’s absolutely disgusting but being alone in any room upstairs just wasn’t an option for me. This was just our normal at the time. For some reason the room I absolutely hated was my mums room. It had this dark feeling every time I peeked inside and most of the time I’d just walk past it as quickly as I could and avoid going in there. 

My mum has told me briefly about me seeing a dog at the end of my bed when I was younger even though we didn’t have a dog. I also vaguely remember thinking there was a boy crying in the bathtub. I don’t personally think these experiences are evidence of the paranormal but they are strange. I also vividly remember some very traumatising nightmares that I believe could have been sleep paralysis as I get it often now. I was very young at the time of some of these dreams and looking back I don’t think they are normal for a 5 year old. I had recurring dreams of someone calling me from downstairs imitating my mum, I knew it wasn’t her as it felt evil so I’d just ignore it and let them call until the morning. I also had frequent horrific nightmares of my family being brutally murdered or attacked and they always ended with me dying too. I could feel the pain in the dream and it always felt like I woke up once I had died. 

A couple of dreams I had were just everyday things with my family that I genuinely believed to be memories until I brought them up a couple years ago and my family had no idea what I was talking about. There are also a few gaps in my childhood memories for seemingly no reason. 

I have spoken about this to a few people and while the dreams are creepy, I still frequently have nightmares like that and I do believe it is just my brain, some have suggested the paranormal though. But the fear of being alone upstairs that carried on until I was 10 just weirds me out. It was such a big part of my life. My family and I were all shocked when we moved and I was absolutely fine with my own room and going upstairs alone. I am considering regression therapy as I believe something might have happened to cause this that I might have blocked out as a child but still kept the fear? 

However, I don’t know much about these things and I really don’t know if it’s worth going through regression therapy for something that could be paranormal or nothing? If anyone knows a little more about these kind of things and regression therapy I’d love to hear it. I don’t know why but I have a strong feeling that something paranormal had scared me at a young age. I’ve always wanted to know what it was that scared me so much.


EDIT: I’d also like to mention that whenever people tried to get me to go upstairs alone, or if I was ever left upstairs alone, I would literally start hyperventilating and having a massive panic attack. This was only ever in that house and it was only me, my mum and my sister living there. 

Furthermore, someone had died in that house before. I’m not sure what room, but I’m also not sure that it was just a simple ghost that was causing the fear. I’ve never felt fear like it since, hence why I believe it’s either childhood trauma or something malevolent. It really felt like something horrible was up there.

,Thetruthishere,"I’ve never posted on here before and I’m honestly not sure how to even start this (I also hope this is a good place to post it lol). But something happened to me when I was about 14 that has left me with a genuine fear of closet’s and relaxing alone with my bedroom door open.

I’ll start with a little backstory. When I was 11 I moved from my childhood home in a bigger, slightly newer home. It was big and a lot more spacious than my old house, so I was excited. But the night we moved in there something about the house didn’t feel right? It just felt the need to constantly look over my shoulder. Nothing actually happened, just weird feelings.

Even after settling in nothing really happened? Other than feeling the constant need to look over my shoulder and occasionally seeing shadows out the corner of my eye.

It wasn’t until I was 14 that something happened and seemed to be the start of weird occurrences?

One morning, I “woke” up (I put it in quotations because never actually opened my eyes), and almost immediately decided to go back to sleep. I feel like it’s important to note that I wasn’t stuck, I could have opened my eyes if I wanted to, but I just didn’t.

As I was laying there, I tried to make myself comfy, so I moved my left arm and hand out from underneath the covers to rest on my side (I was laying on my right side with my back facing my open bedroom door). And as I lay there I began to hear what sounded like someone dragging their feet across the carpet. I wasn’t worried at this point bc my room was at the very end of the hall, and the bathroom was right before it, so I figured someone was going to the bathroom.

But they passed the bathroom and walked right into my room and opened my closet (my closet door creaked really bad when someone would open it). I still rationalized it in my mind as my mom, as she would put my clothes away for me. But then, the shuffling started up again and the walked back towards the door, but they didn’t leave, they stopped and I suddenly felt an ice cold, wrinkled hand grab mine, not threateningly, just a nice hold (think of when friends hold hands lol) and like any normal person I got scared as fuck.

So I tensed up, but was too scared to open my eyes. I tried to tell myself that it was my grandma (who lived with us) and she had finally lost her damn mind. The hand suddenly started rubbing circles with it’s thumb on my hand. For some reason I start to relax bc I convinced myself that it was grandma who had finally lost it.

But as soon as I relaxed the grip went from light to almost crushing? and the things nails felt like claws digging into my hand? The hand yanked me, like it was trying to move me. And that’s when I finally opened my eyes and sat up, but there was nothing there? I can’t remember if my closet door was shut completely or not, but I do remember that it wasn’t wide open like it should have been.

It was weird and I was terrified. I looked at my hand, and started rubbing it. It looked normal, no finger marks or anything (I’m very pale, so squeezing my hand like that would have been noticeable for at least a second or two), it just had little indents where the nails would have been?

I obviously got the fuck out my room after I saw the little marks, but I never actually told anyone until after we moved out the house. It scared me to think about then, and even talking about it now is setting off my anxiety.

I’m sorry this is so long, and I hope you guys actually take me seriously. I tried to sound as “adult” as possible while telling this. This happened about 7 years ago now and has left me with a lot of serious, but at the same time, very silly fears. 

I just wanted honest opinions as to whether this might have been a ghost or not.

,Thetruthishere,"I recently posted here about a past experience with a shadow entity and somebody was interested in some of my other stories, so this is my experience living in a very active house about 5 years ago. Sorry for the long post, there were many creepy occurrences there.

Just after graduation my family moved into a house previously owned by my great grandmother. There were 5 of us at first: my parents and I, my friend K, and my boyfriend (now husband) who had moved in due to not wanting to move out of state with his family.

The House had it odd layout, as it had been a mobile home that had an add on in the front (living room) and the back (master bedroom). Bf had a room on one end of the house, K &amp; I shared a room on the other end, the kitchen was in the middle. To get to the main bathroom you would have to go through the room that K &amp; I shared.

It started with little things, weird feelings, moved objects, the sound of furniture being dragged and moved, most notably the bathroom door. We started keeping it shut at night, otherwise it would open and close on its own. It did this all the time, day or night. We checked for drafts and anything that could cause it and found nothing. We began to notice that anytime it started to move, if we got irritated and told it to stop the door would immediately cease to move. One night we hadn’t been in bed long when K got up to use the bathroom. I heard her leave the bathroom without closing the door and I told her to close it because it bothered me. I heard the long creak of the door as it slowly shut, but didn’t quite click into place. I irritability told her to shut it all the way, when she responded “that wasn’t me...” in a horrified tone from the opposite corner of the room. I turned the light on and the door was completely shut, just not clicked into the frame. I ripped the door open and nothing was there. We were completely freaked out. I slammed the door and told her that is why I keep the door shut.

There was also the knocking. We had 3 doors on the house leading outside. Pretty frequently we would here 3 knocks on any of the doors. I always look out the window before opening the door if we’re not expecting any guests because you never know who might be there, so I would check the window and nobody would be there. I was once standing in front of the back door when this happened and I could clearly see through the window on the door that nobody was there, but the door was shaking as it was hit. 

My bf started having vivid nightmares of something trying to drag him from his bed. Later my mother’s friend was over with her toddler and he was exploring like a normal kid his age. He stopped in the doorway to my bfs room and stared for a while. He then came back and started saying “ghost” and pointing at my bfs room. Nobody had mentioned anything remotely related to a ghost or scary story and this was nowhere near Halloween either. We tried to brush it off, but he was insistent. We tried to ask for details but he would only say “go see” and “ghost”. I followed him back to the room and he pointed at the small game closet and insisted “ghost!” “Go see!”. I opened the door for him and nothing was there, but he insisted there was a ghost.

The worst night we spent in the house was when we had been in bed for about 45 minutes when suddenly something slammed into the bed with enough force to shake the whole mattress. My bed frame didn’t fit in the small room, so the mattress was on the box spring on the floor. Both K &amp; I felt it. We turned the light on and there was nothing so we got as far from the edges of the bed as possible and tried to sleep. Something grabbed Ks foot and yanked her blanket away. Once again the light revealed nothing and we were terrified. Something slammed into the wall next to the other side of the bed. These things continued into the night and we ended up sleeping in the living room with my dad staying with us.

My parents eventually moved out after a few months into the house they were working on and left us the hell house. K &amp; I moved into the master room and made our old room the area where we kept our 2 new puppies kennels. On 3 occasions my 8 month old pit would walk into that room, throw himself on the floor with all of his hair standing on end, and scream and growl while fixated on the upper corner of the room. When he would do this I would have to physically drag him from the room and shut the door to calm him. The other dog would somehow get out of a locked kennel when he was left in there alone and the kennel would still be locked and secure, we still have no idea how he did it.

K and my mother started hearing voices when they were there alone and the uncomfortable feeling got worse. One night something started clawing at our bedroom door and we we so freaked out by it that I called my bf to come look at the door from the other side because I was too scared to unlock and open it.

The House got 5 ft of water in it during hurricane Harvey and we tore it down and moved. I never felt upset over losing the house, I was just relieved to be rid of it and hoped that the flood took whatever was there with it.

Sorry for the long post, if I think of anything else I might add it in an edit.

EDIT: We did attempt to catch something on video one night.

Sorry for the long post, there were many creepy occurrences there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just after graduation my family moved into a house previously owned by my great grandmother. There were 5 of us at first: my parents and I, my friend K, and my boyfriend (now husband) who had moved in due to not wanting to move out of state with his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House had it odd layout, as it had been a mobile home that had an add on in the front (living room) and the back (master bedroom). Bf had a room on one end of the house, K &amp;amp; I shared a room on the other end, the kitchen was in the middle. To get to the main bathroom you would have to go through the room that K &amp;amp; I shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with little things, weird feelings, moved objects, the sound of furniture being dragged and moved, most notably the bathroom door. We started keeping it shut at night, otherwise it would open and close on its own. It did this all the time, day or night. We checked for drafts and anything that could cause it and found nothing. We began to notice that anytime it started to move, if we got irritated and told it to stop the door would immediately cease to move. One night we hadn’t been in bed long when K got up to use the bathroom. I heard her leave the bathroom without closing the door and I told her to close it because it bothered me. I heard the long creak of the door as it slowly shut, but didn’t quite click into place. I irritability told her to shut it all the way, when she responded “that wasn’t me...” in a horrified tone from the opposite corner of the room. I turned the light on and the door was completely shut, just not clicked into the frame. I ripped the door open and nothing was there. We were completely freaked out. I slammed the door and told her that is why I keep the door shut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also the knocking. We had 3 doors on the house leading outside. Pretty frequently we would here 3 knocks on any of the doors. I always look out the window before opening the door if we’re not expecting any guests because you never know who might be there, so I would check the window and nobody would be there. I was once standing in front of the back door when this happened and I could clearly see through the window on the door that nobody was there, but the door was shaking as it was hit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bf started having vivid nightmares of something trying to drag him from his bed. Later my mother’s friend was over with her toddler and he was exploring like a normal kid his age. He stopped in the doorway to my bfs room and stared for a while. He then came back and started saying “ghost” and pointing at my bfs room. Nobody had mentioned anything remotely related to a ghost or scary story and this was nowhere near Halloween either. We tried to brush it off, but he was insistent. We tried to ask for details but he would only say “go see” and “ghost”. I followed him back to the room and he pointed at the small game closet and insisted “ghost!” “Go see!”. I opened the door for him and nothing was there, but he insisted there was a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst night we spent in the house was when we had been in bed for about 45 minutes when suddenly something slammed into the bed with enough force to shake the whole mattress. My bed frame didn’t fit in the small room, so the mattress was on the box spring on the floor. Both K &amp;amp; I felt it. We turned the light on and there was nothing so we got as far from the edges of the bed as possible and tried to sleep. Something grabbed Ks foot and yanked her blanket away. Once again the light revealed nothing and we were terrified. Something slammed into the wall next to the other side of the bed. These things continued into the night and we ended up sleeping in the living room with my dad staying with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents eventually moved out after a few months into the house they were working on and left us the hell house. K &amp;amp; I moved into the master room and made our old room the area where we kept our 2 new puppies kennels. On 3 occasions my 8 month old pit would walk into that room, throw himself on the floor with all of his hair standing on end, and scream and growl while fixated on the upper corner of the room. When he would do this I would have to physically drag him from the room and shut the door to calm him. The other dog would somehow get out of a locked kennel when he was left in there alone and the kennel would still be locked and secure, we still have no idea how he did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K and my mother started hearing voices when they were there alone and the uncomfortable feeling got worse. One night something started clawing at our bedroom door and we we so freaked out by it that I called my bf to come look at the door from the other side because I was too scared to unlock and open it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House got 5 ft of water in it during hurricane Harvey and we tore it down and moved. I never felt upset over losing the house, I was just relieved to be rid of it and hoped that the flood took whatever was there with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, if I think of anything else I might add it in an edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: We did attempt to catch something on video one night. We set up a new video camera with a full battery in our room before bed and left the bathroom light on because the camera didn’t do night vision. When I checked it in the morning there was only about half an hour of video before the camera apparently died. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but later on I realized that something must have drained the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Right up front, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this story, so if it isn't please forgive me. I read a few of the posts here and was reminded of this particular experience of mine.

A brief background: I was raised Catholic. I don't feel as close to the Church as I used to but I do consider myself religious/spiritual. After 3rd grade, my parents started sending me to Catholic schools, and I was baptized and confirmed in the faith.

A few times in my life, I've had a strange sensation manifest itself during moments that were very spiritually significant in some way. It's not a very flashy story, but it's one of those things that kinda affirms my belief in God. I know it's happened multiple times but I can only recall one specific instance. 

During a church retreat I went on as a part of Confirmation, I was a part of a meditation of sorts. In actuality, it was just kind of a ""let's calm down and think about God"" moment. We were in a chapel, myself, a handful of other teenagers, and our adult group leader. We were lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling.

The leader led us through a meditation, talking us through a reflection on God. While we were lying there, just thinking about God, I felt something weird in my chest. It felt like hot water was being poured into my heart. 

To elaborate, imagine the sensation of the first sip of a warm drink going down your throat. Imagine feeling the warmth of that drink as it travels to your stomach. Now, imagine that feeling a little farther forward in your chest than your throat. Imagine it where your heart is, right behind your ribs, nestled between your lungs. That's what I felt.

That was the first time I felt it, but I have felt it multiple times since, all during intimate religious moments. I don't really have any way to prove this in anyway, considering this was just a sensation I felt in my chest, but that's my story.

I’ve come across this subreddit recently and after reading multiple stories it had me remembering something strange that happened to my sister and I when we were younger. Just for context, at the moment she is 27 and I (male) am 23. 

When I was around 7-10 years old I would have this reoccurring dream where my sister and I are in my dads truck, she was always the driver and I was always the passenger. This dream always took place on the same part of the street where I could see our mailbox through the lower left side of the front windshield. For whatever reason the same thing would always happen in the dream, the truck would start up and take off by itself and neither of us could control it or make it stop. It would always end up crashing which would startle me and wake me up in the middle of the night. 
I never really thought much of this dream at the time, just brushed it off as you would after any weird dream, I did however find it a bit odd that I had had the same specific dream like 9-10 times. 

Anyways a couple years later when I was around 13 I was watching tv with my dad and 3 sisters. We were watching a show that I guess was people telling stories of weird dreams they had. Intrigued by the idea, this sparked up a conversation within my family and we started sharing the weird dreams we experienced. Most of them were what you’d expect, stories of being able to fly or having superpowers etc. nothing out of the ordinary. Then (the specific sister who was always in my dream) started talking about her dreams. She started by saying that a couple of years before, she had a reoccurring dream where her and I were in my dads truck. She then went on to explain the dream EXACTLY how I had them, down to what seemed like the smallest detail. Her always being the driver me always being the passenger the truck parked in the same spot I saw it with the mailbox in the same view as mine. How the dream started and how the dream ended. 
Obviously I was very shocked. I felt almost speechless as she was telling it but after she was done I tried explaining to everyone that I had the EXACT same reoccurring dream. Of course everyone thought I was joking, including her. I was pretty frustrated because no one would believe me so I just gave it up and moved on. 
A couple days later I went up to her and told her again that I was serious and that I was freaking out because I had the exact same dream. We then spoke about it for awhile and shared details of what we remember. Our 2 dreams seemed to match up perfectly with other smaller details matching that I won’t bother writing about here in fear of this being too long. 
This really freaked us both out. Neither of us had a good explanation for this. We’re a family of 5 kids (3 girls 2 boys) but as it pertained to this specific dream I had always dreamt her and she had always dreamt me. We decided that when we have the dream again we’ll tell each other the next day but ever since that conversation neither of us have had the dream again.

&lt;p&gt;I know this story isn’t as crazy as a lot of the other ones on this subreddit but it always freaks me out when I think about it. Have any of you had any similar experiences with a sibling? I would love to hear your stories.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,This happened back when I was a senior in high school. I used to live in a around a 100 year old farm house. The house was up on a hill and below there is the Old cattle barn. And across the street there is a cemetery that dates back to the founding of the town that I live in (around the late 1840s). So one night three friends and I are chilling around a apple tree that's behind my house. They are all talking and I am standing there looking down at the cattle barn and in the light there's a white around I would say 5' tall white figure walking up the hill. So I say hay look at that and we all just start running back to the front of the house. After we all got are stuff back together me and my one friend went back and saw it along the wood line it the back. Later that night I would say around 1 in the morning the same friend and I were on the porch and both of us saw two black figures join into one and disappear.

I will never forget what I saw I’m 25 now this was back in 2003 was in third grade.

So I usually never liked going to the restroom during class because well I’ve always been afraid of the dark or going to restrooms with a bunch of stalls  alone it just freaks me out.

,Thetruthishere,"Every night going to sleep throughout my life I have felt like I wasn't alone. I would see and hear things in the dark, often feeling something as well. I always just brushed it off as something from my dreams, or a really vivid imagination.

It started in my old house, when I was very little. I would often feel the presence of something around me. Stalking me. And when going up the stairs next to a huge window I felt scared, like it could come out at any point.

It was definitely a hostile feeling. I always felt like I was being hunted. And one night I felt it in the house. I was terrified of the bathroom in front of my room. Not anywhere else. Not the creepy basement door to nowhere, not the dark corridor, not the empty room next to me that creaked. The bathroom. I felt like it was watching me.

After a couple of years we finally moved, but I didn't stop feeling whatever ""it"" is. I felt like it was in my room now. Watching from the corners. Making noises sometimes.

Then I moved again, and that was the most stressful and horrible couple of years of my life. I was really depressed. Sometimes when I felt the presence I started talking to it. Venting my frustrations and asking it to please go away and leave me be. It never really worked.

But I felt things change a little. I felt like the hostility was somewhat disappearing. And even though I was still creeped out, I didn't feel afraid anymore.

And recently things have changed quite a bit too. I tried talking to it sometimes, trying to get any confirmation it was actually there, and not just something my mind came up with all these years.

I started confiding some personal information with it, talking about some of my fears and anxieties.

A couple of days ago I lost my guitar pick. I couldn't find it anywhere. Looked everywhere I could and didn't find it at all. So I asked for it out loud. I said, to my seemingly empty room ""could you please give back my pick? It's important to me"".

Some days later, while I'm alone, I'm at my desk, writing and drawing. My pencil falls and I have to get up to get it. When I'm back there it is. The guitar pick just one top of my desk, as if nothing had ever happened. I thanked whatever it is who is in my room and went about my day.

Now I don't feel the hostility at all. But it's definitely still not friendly. I think I might be gaining its trust in a way. Earning it's friendship.

I have also been feeling its presence outside of my home as well. Keeping me from feeling lonely. When on my room, I think it might be protecting me in a way. I sense different presences some times, and even when they are hostile I feel like I don't have to worry. I never get harmed in any way from these ""entities"", and I think my dear friend here has something to do with it.

Anyone had a similar experience? Should I be concerned about what's happening? I really want to earn its trust, any ideas on how to do it?

,Thetruthishere,"This was around the time I was in middle school.

,Thetruthishere,"I’ve posted this before on another thread. This became a frequent occurrence for a long time and although I’m free of it now, the memory still haunts me. Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom.

Between the ages of around 8-17 something used to watch me sleep.

A bit of background: I lived in a mobile home at the time and my room was on one end and my parents room was on the other end. The way my bed was facing was perpendicular to the door where I could see all the way to my parents room from my bed.

For some reason I could not sleep with the door shut without horrible anxiety, it felt like something  bad would be on the other side. I also felt compelled to stare down the hall until I fell asleep, If I turned my back to the door I immediately turned back over because of an increasing feeling of dread. 

I’m trying to sleep one night, hadn’t been in bed long, when I saw it. A tall dark silhouette in the middle of the hall. It didn’t have any features it was just darker than the darkness around it and I could not see through it. I was confused at first and called out for one of my parents to ask why they were just standing in the hall. This thing didn’t move or make a sound. I realized with horror that this was not one of my parents, I stared at it in terror and after a few agonizing minutes it melted into the dark and I could see to the other side of the house again. After that I shut my eyes and refused to open them until the sun was up. My parents didn’t believe me, nobody had ever died in that house. I tried to tell myself that it was just a dream, but was sure that I had been awake at the time. 

It happened again a few weeks later and then started occurring with increasing frequency going from once a month or so to sometimes twice a week. It scared the hell out me every time. Even though it didn’t have any features whatsoever I could feel it staring at me. My mom once suggested that it was a guardian angel, but no guardian angel would emanate such a feeling of malice. 

Eventually we renovated my room and I got a new bed and it was placed on the same wall as the door so that I could no longer look down the hall. I was extremely opposed to the idea at first, but the first night I got the best sleep I’d had in years. I was no longer compelled to stare at the door, I could turn my back to it or even close it if I wished. It was wonderful. 

Several months later I had been in bed for probably half an hour when I I looked over and found it standing in my room 3 feet from me. I was absolutely horrified, it had never moved from its place in the hall and now it was within arms reach. I just stared at it, shaking, until it melted into the door. 

A few months later I had just laid down when I heard someone in the bathroom next to my room. I thought it was my father and I had a question so I called out to him, but no answer. I thought that was odd, so I rolled over to get up and talk to him. I heard the bead curtain in my doorway move and watched as someone leaned in and around the corner to look at me then back out and the curtain fell back into place.

This became a frequent occurrence for a long time and although I’m free of it now, the memory still haunts me. Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the ages of around 8-17 something used to watch me sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of background: I lived in a mobile home at the time and my room was on one end and my parents room was on the other end. The way my bed was facing was perpendicular to the door where I could see all the way to my parents room from my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I could not sleep with the door shut without horrible anxiety, it felt like something  bad would be on the other side. I also felt compelled to stare down the hall until I fell asleep, If I turned my back to the door I immediately turned back over because of an increasing feeling of dread. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to sleep one night, hadn’t been in bed long, when I saw it. A tall dark silhouette in the middle of the hall. It didn’t have any features it was just darker than the darkness around it and I could not see through it. I was confused at first and called out for one of my parents to ask why they were just standing in the hall. This thing didn’t move or make a sound. I realized with horror that this was not one of my parents, I stared at it in terror and after a few agonizing minutes it melted into the dark and I could see to the other side of the house again. After that I shut my eyes and refused to open them until the sun was up. My parents didn’t believe me, nobody had ever died in that house. I tried to tell myself that it was just a dream, but was sure that I had been awake at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened again a few weeks later and then started occurring with increasing frequency going from once a month or so to sometimes twice a week. It scared the hell out me every time. Even though it didn’t have any features whatsoever I could feel it staring at me. My mom once suggested that it was a guardian angel, but no guardian angel would emanate such a feeling of malice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we renovated my room and I got a new bed and it was placed on the same wall as the door so that I could no longer look down the hall. I was extremely opposed to the idea at first, but the first night I got the best sleep I’d had in years. I was no longer compelled to stare at the door, I could turn my back to it or even close it if I wished. It was wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several months later I had been in bed for probably half an hour when I I looked over and found it standing in my room 3 feet from me. I was absolutely horrified, it had never moved from its place in the hall and now it was within arms reach. I just stared at it, shaking, until it melted into the door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later I had just laid down when I heard someone in the bathroom next to my room. I thought it was my father and I had a question so I called out to him, but no answer. I thought that was odd, so I rolled over to get up and talk to him. I heard the bead curtain in my doorway move and watched as someone leaned in and around the corner to look at me then back out and the curtain fell back into place. It was just a silhouette, no features. I went to my parents room and asked if they had just been down the hall and of course they had been in bed for at least 20 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Hi, so I am working on the assumption that this is not paranormal but havent has luck on other subs. Was hoping maybe someone here had an idea what I partially captured last night. Any ideas would be helpful.

Last night was walking my dog and looked up in the sky and saw what almost looked like a arch (not a steep one, nearly flat). I stopped for a few mins to watch it and it seemed to rotate very slowly. The photos do not capture the full size but best I could do with the phone. Any idea what it is? I’m thinking some sort of cloud, but figured reddit could help.

The photos are taken about 2 mins apart and maybe 5-6 linear feet of change in my position.

For those who can’t tell it’s the streak in the middle of the photo just above the trees.

,Thetruthishere,"(Okay so this is gonna be a longish one because you kinda have to get the feel of my house, so you can see the picture) 

My step dad has his own house, my Mom and I moved in my first year of highschool, I was 14. Everything went well for a year and I got first pick of my room, the one closest to the lounge so my baby sister could be closer to my parents. Our rooms are along the passageway on the left, and across from it is the bathroom and the kitchen doors. The lounge had a door and my parents had the room at the end of the hallway, and the lounge door was across from it directly. We have a house alarm system and we would close the doors to the kitchen and lounge (locking the lounge one) so our cat wouldn't trip the alarm. The room next door was largely unoccupied since my sister is clingy and slept with my parents more than not, but it didn't bug me. The two rooms are exactly the same size and are quite small, but my Mom gave me her queen size bed and because my room is tiny the foot of the bed was about half a ruler length away from the door when open, which it always is, not fully because I have a desk stopping it at the foot of my bed. 

One night in mid March or so I woke up at about 2 am, no idea why but all I knew is I was scared. I looked up towards my door and a light was on somewhere very faintly, I still don't know where but it wasn't from any of the rooms and in the light was a person standing at the foot of my bed, half covered by the door. He was short and stocky and had a hat on. He looked like an old school mafia member in those movies, with a suit jacket and one of those hats that big bosses in those same movies wear. I can't think of the name. He had no face and he didn't move. He just stood. I thought my stepdad had come to check on me, but something told me not to call out. I dove under my covers and prayed till I passed out, I couldn't make sure he wasn't there, in fact I think he stood there until after I passed out. I was sure I was awake, and the next morning I asked my Mom and my stepdad if he had checked on me. No one had been awake or come into my room to check up on me. My Mom was skeptical when I told her and my stepfather too but believed me. It never came back but a year and a bed change to a single later I felt the same presence behind me in the same spot twice, but a woman. I never looked at her I never said anything.

These areas include:

Jackson Highway 16 - which connects them all \*This includes a locally known Sloughhouse Inn &amp;amp; Diner, located right off the highway. I personally had an experience while simply driving this highway, same goes for two people I know, each happening separately but in the same area

,Thetruthishere,"First off I am not even sure if this belongs on here. Sorry in advance if it doesn't. Last year for my birthday in June my boyfriend bought me a book because I love to read. I asked why did he pick the book he did, and he said ""It's the author my grandmother used to read so I thought you might like it."" The book he bought me is called Woman of God by James Patterson. I didn't read the book until around early this past November and it is an emotionally wrenching book. The main character loses a lover, two husbands and a child through out the novel.

,Thetruthishere,"Hi all!

In about two weeks, I will be receiving a haunted doll in the mail. It's an older Harlequin Mime doll, standing 18 inches tall. Picture [Here](https://imgur.com/VyFyS8j)

I've never dealt with a haunted doll before, and this one is described as active, and full of bad juju. I'd suggest not looking at the picture for too long, as particularly sensitive folks report headaches. I myself feel a tightness when looking into its eyes, and it's not particularly pleasant.

I plan to do a long term investigation on him, but, some of the reported paranormal activity is on the far side of negative. It's described as a nightmare bringer, manipulative, and potentially dangerous. During their investigation, they ended up consecrating and destroying an Ouija Board because the entity within the doll had them convinced that without an immediate end to communication, it would bring ""others"" through. He's a liar and lover of chaos. He's known to bring up bad memories through EVPs in attempts to shame you...

One of the more worrisome facets of his description is he likes to attempt to make deals for information and material wealth, in return for chaos.(Demonic?)

Does anyone have any suggestions on how best to contain it?

My current idea is a sealed case with holy symbols and my own mix of Chaos magic sigils of protection. Only removing it when I want to study, and communicate.

Any suggestions and questions are welcome!

Note: Outside of reports from someone I consider reputable, I do not have any physical evidence of doll possession. Once I have the doll, you can expect anything I find, I will post.

Notes for clarification:

I did not purchase this doll. The current owners are shipping it to me, free of charge. I met them at a ghost hunt a few years back, and they are apparently really well known for their haunted doll collection. They received this doll a while back, and it's energy doesn't mesh with their own. They dislike it, and want it gone.

I volunteered.

With that being said, could it not be haunted? Sure. But I also don't think they would spend their own money to ship it to me unless they REALLY wanted it gone.

So far we've got one mention of the picture making someone uncomfortable.

We have:

Glass case

Vacuum sealing?

Salt circle

Holy symbols

Gold and Silver

So far so good!

,Thetruthishere,"This happened to me years ago.  A little bit of a back story of the site.  My Aunt's home is supposedly built on a Native American burial site.  Or so I've been told that.  My cousins would share their experiences with me but I only half believed. 

On to my experience.....

By this time the sun is going down and the street lamps are starting to turn on.  I see a woman walking, holding hands with a toddler.  As they turn right at the corner I notice it's not a toddler at all.  It is a doll type thing, for lack of better words, walking and it turns back to look at me.  It gives me this horrible wide white grin.  It's hair was string and its legs were like the accordion style legs you give a paper doll in elementary school.  I was completely freak out!!!  So, again I tell myself I'm imagining thigs and go inside.  It's time for bed and I am trying not to think of the odd things that happened.  I start praying and hoping I don't see or hear anything while it's night time.  Then I hear it, well them.  I hear my cousin, clear as day, fighting with her husband.  Full on fighting over where he's been and how she hates it here.  Thing is, here was in Hawaii, they were living in Hawaii at the time.  I ended up crying myself to sleep cause my mom wouldn't pick me up that night.  Needless to say I have not been back there since.

,Thetruthishere,"In December I went to Key West and visited the famous Robert the Doll. I was familiar with his history and etiquette for meeting him before going so I was as respectful as possible and even brought him candy. Before we approached his room I saw something moving in the glare of the glass display. When we went in the room no one was there and we couldn't explain what I saw. I asked to take his photo and felt like I wasn't get any bad vibes so I did take it. My husband, being the skeptic he is, was somewhat joking about the whole thing but I don't think he said anything disrespectful.

We went back to our airbnb the next day and this place had a really creepy atmosphere. We had been staying there for over a month by that point and several of our friends had eerie experiences but nothing too crazy. We were in the house alone the first night back and we heard noises in the empty laundry shoot. Checked it, still completely empty.

We went to bed and I felt like something was off. After taking forever to fall asleep I was woken up at around 2am to noises on the floor. I didn't open my eyes at first because my brain was trying to give a logical answer for why it sounded like someone was going through our suitcase in the middle of the night. I listened for at least a minute before opening my eyes to see a Victorian woman in a white dress standing on my husband's side of the bed. Her face was covered by a white lace veil but I knew in that moment that this was not a spirit, it was something else. I was frozen in fear and unable to move for a good twenty seconds before I started screaming and pushing my husband to wake him up. It faded into the wall infront of my eyes. By the time my husband fully woke up and realized something was wrong I was shaking and hyperventilating. I had never seen an entity before. 

I smudged the entire house (which was a mansion so that shit took forever) and while I was ringing the bells to chase evil out the door to our bedroom slammed in my face as I approached it. Our friends came back that night and we didn't have any more experiences.

Do you think this was Robert? I feel like it wasn't, but it could have been related. I already felt weird about the house before we went and maybe I just opened myself up too much to interact with the paranormal.

Two weeks later we went to Vegas and went through Zak Bagans Haunted Museum which had lots of equally famous haunted dolls. That night in the hotel room our sink faucet turned on by itself. You have to physically turn the knob to get water to come out and we heard it turning before the water started. We tried and could not debunk it. 

No more experiences since December though and it was by pure coincidence that we saw so many haunted dolls in one month, it definitely wasn't planned.

It's pretty typical to not remember briefly waking up in the middle of sleep but he said I was like wide awake and was sitting up.

,Thetruthishere,"
Here’s the story. Sorry for waiting a day, I was busy. This happened years and years ago so some parts are a little fuzzy for me but I’ll tell you what I can remember.

So it started off as a Normal summer day. Maybe 5pm. I was about, 11 or 12.
At the time I was staying at my moms house, it was a trailer, in the middle of nowhere, a cornfield. I lived with my younger brother as well. My older brother lived a couple of miles away at my grandparents house.
Me and my mom got into a big verbal fight one day. Not sure about what. She took my phone, I paid for it at the time. So I was a little upset about that, and whatever we were arguing about. 

(I remember after she took it, a loud ringing started coming from my phone, not a ringtone, it was way way louder, not sure what that was, it didn’t sound like it was coming from a speaker, I asked her, she didn’t answer.) 

I ended up basically throwing a fit and running away. I should also mention I had a fucked up child hood, my parents weren’t great. I know I lashed out sometimes but it was usually justified, usually, not always. 

So we lived in the middle of nowhere, corn fields on all sides of our house, with one long empty road running through them/in front of our house. 

So I ran away. First I walked down the long road, for miles. I was walking for a couple of hours. I made it to a house with a blue truck, then I turned around and started heading back home.

 (I don’t remember much of the walk back home or what happened next, my next memory is when it’s dark, almost pitch black, I’m near my house, in the cornfield, crouching down, a few hundred feet back, watching my family in the yard looking for me)

Turns out my older brother and the police showed up. The police left for some reason. 

I was crouching down just playing with the dirt, un sure of what to do, I was bored.

Suddenly I heard a sound right behind me, there’s was an animal literally about a foot or two behind me. I knew because it made this ticking yelp sound, I can’t describe it, a weird sound I had never heard before, (later discovered it was probably a coyote), I was filled with instant fear and my fight or flight kicked in. 

Suddenly I jumped up, still half crouching because I didn’t want to be seen by my family, I sprinted faster than I ever have, across the whole field, I mean insanely fast, I’ve always been known for being a fast runner, but this time was different, I was filled with fear and adrenaline, I shit you not I ran faster then I’ve seen anyone ever run in my whole life. I ran for about a minute. Crouched down for 2 seconds or so. Then ran another hundred feet or so. 
Then crouched down. Looking around me into the darkness. Still filled with this animal instinct, (which could have been the cause for my black eyes).

At this time I was pretty close to the house, like 50 feet from the property line still crouched down. My older brother spots me, he says “(my name) is that you?” I don’t respond. I didn’t want him to see me and I could sense the fear in him as he was walking up. 

He walks up, now 4 feet from me, I look at him, he says something along the lines of 
“(My name) your eyes are completely black” I could sense he was afraid and filled with fear, I still didn’t want to be found at the time. I thought it would be funny to scare him, for whatever reason I’m not sure why. I lunged out from my crouching position at him, while hissing, running towards him, and he bolted back to the house.

I literally don’t remember a single thing after this point. I’m not sure why. Or even what happened to this day, I never asked my family either I figured it’s best to not bring this night up.

I’ve heard stories of people’s eyes going black when they are in a complete state of fear or anger, I’m not sure if that’s why mine turned black or not, if they even did..

I asked him about this night awhile back and he swore that my eyes were completely black.

A spiritual entity / alien has been visiting me all month during meditation, but I've always remained on the couch. Today, feb 26th, right after midnight, the entity had me stand up and it pointed my head towards the door to outside. I walk over in that direction and it pulls me towards the door still. So I put on my jacket and shoes and head outside. 

I live in a mansion with an elevator; it can take you a while to walk around the house. The entity pulls me down a walkway, up the stairs,  to the very end of the balcony where noone really goes. I see a chair in the direction its pulling me so I sit down. It turns my head towards this painting and I pick it up and carry it back to the basement to have a closer look.

It's a picture of a goat leaning over a fence. What is it trying to show me? Sign? Does anyone know of any goat symbology? Some help on this would be appreciated.

After I took a picture of it, the entity had be go all the back to where the painting hang and put it back. It even made me turn around and fix the painting because I left it crooked lol. I get back to the basement and it starts pulling me towards this creepy ass room:

It led me into that back part and turned my head to the left. I picked up the trophy and left. It made me go back in and as I stood in the back part it turned my head to the left again. In front of me was some random cup. So I picked it up and there's a necklace and a ring. The gold was real. I was surprised.

I wasn't sure which piece it was interested in so I put them on opposite sides of a table. The entity turned my head towards the ring and had me put it on. It was too small, but I did anyway as far as i could. And then it still pointed me to the necklace so i put that on too. Then it went back to business as usual in meditation. Any insights will be helpful, thank you.

,Thetruthishere,"Once again, here's another story that was told to me by my ex-husband and if memories serve me correct it happened to his ex-stepmother's stepfather who I'll call Tom\* (try wrapping your brain around that).

Anyway, here's his story.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
Years ago, Tom was working at a job (I can't remember where) where he would oftentimes work late. So it wasn't unusual for him to be driving home late at night.

As you know, highways are littered with mile markers and Louisiana was no exception.

One night while driving home he noticed a lady wearing a white dress standing near mile marker 5\* (I can't remember the exact number) and although he felt bad for the lady he didn't stop.

She was beautiful with her long flowing hair and the dress she was wearing reminded him of one of those dresses from the 1800s.

He continued to drive and noticed that each time he passed a new mile marker, he would see the lady in white standing there.

Naturally, this creeped him out so he stepped on the gas, not once slowing down so I guess you could say he put the pedal to the metal.

But anyway, just before approaching the next mile marker though he looked into his rearview mirror and got the shock of his life because sitting in the backseat was none other than the lady in white this time with a malicious look on her face that quickly distorted into something hideous.

As he was fastly approaching mile marker 8\* he began to hear this evil laughter that echoed throughout his car but ignored it (although he was scared shitless) and kept driving.

Apparently, she began to wail like a banshee because he was getting away.

Eventually, she vanished from his car but what was to follow was even scarier...

He then saw movement off to his right and what he saw, he would never forget...

It was the same lady in white chasing him but this time it was just her disembodied head that was cackling like a witch.

The head also seemed to be getting bigger and at times would make its appearance inside his car scaring him even more.

Her head began to weave in and out of Tom's car all the while continuing to pursue him (or I should say her head continued to pursue him) keeping the same pace as the car that was until finally, they reached mile marker 9\* and then, she vanished.

Needless to say, he didn't hang around long and made it home in record time.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
Oh, in case you're wondering Tom continued to take that highway for twenty or so more years but never experienced the lady in white again.

&lt;p&gt;Her head began to weave in and out of Tom&amp;#39;s car all the while continuing to pursue him (or I should say her head continued to pursue him) keeping the same pace as the car that was until finally, they reached mile marker 9* and then, she vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, he didn&amp;#39;t hang around long and made it home in record time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, in case you&amp;#39;re wondering Tom continued to take that highway for twenty or so more years but never experienced the lady in white again. Anyway, for some reason when I think about this story it reminds me of the short story in Creepshow 2 about the hitchhiker and for some reason I always feel compelled to say to myself, &amp;quot;Thanks for the ride, lady.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"So yesterday I found this subreddit and spent the day reading it and at I a certain point I felt like I needed to stop reading it because I was had some kind of feeling that it might attract the attention of the nasty critters but I didn't really have anything to base this on so I stopped for a while and then started up again. I had been reading a lot of posts about shadow people and in the comments there was a lot about sleep paralysis which I had previously never experienced at least not in the terrifying way that every one describes but it IS A symptom of restless leg syndrome which I have. But I am also medicated for it. 

So I go to bed last night kinda wishing that I hadn't read so many spooky stories before bed. 

In the middle of the night I feel like I have woken up and above me on the bed is a humanoid figure made of shadows and I have the impression that its hands are around my throat although I am not experiencing any trouble breathing. And I cannot move. And I remembered from all the posts that I had read yesterday that i am supposed to be stronger than anything that comes at a person while they are in sleep paralysis so I fight the paralysis and I have a bite gaurd in my mouth because I clench my teeth and night and I start trying to force the words ""go away"" out of my mouth and move my arm to wake up my fiance and eventually I am able to force the words out after a lot of shitty mumble attempts and get my arm to touch my guy. And after I say go away it does and the sun comes up and my guy wakes up in my dream and is like admiring the way the sunlight hits my face (and I sleep with black out curtains so this part is definitely fiction) and then I actually wake up.

The weird thing is that I didn't have a lot of feelings of serious lingering fear I mostly feel loved but I am still half of sleep but like a safe half asleep and I ""go away"" out loud for real this time and then I roll over to snuggle with my guy even though it was too warm and fell back asleep.


Now until yesterday I didn't know anything about shadow people specifically. But when I was a sophmore high school I would go on walks with my dog to the local park at night. (Night is a stretch I live in Minnesota so it was like going at 6:00 but it was dark) 
And I always had the impression of shadows being where they didn't belong and watching me and when  sensation of movement at the corners of my eyes and when I got home I'd find new bruises on my arms and legs.  At the time I had just read a the book Tithe at the time so convinced myself it was get creatures. So I stopped going out at night but I had a lot of trouble sleeping at night because I just felt like I was being watched. It was that feeling you had when you were a child where you are too scared to open your eyes for fear of what was in your room at night but as a high schooler. 

Everyone told me I was imagining it and I was like ""I mean, like, I know but it means my mind is a horrible place to be. 

Years later I was diagnosed as bipolar and I just chalked it up to that but it should be noted that I am type 2 bipolar and since then I have had no hallucinations I would just get really depressed or when I was manic I would just get really artisticly productive and a little slutty and bubblier and I'd spend all of my money on stupid shit. 


Anyway i just wanted to get some feedback on whether it was just an odd dream? Especially because it seems like shadow people are mostly just kinda watchers from the posts i read yesterday.


Edit:
I also want to add that I am well medicated for bipolar and I have 0 symptoms. And I am also in the happiest time of my life that I have ever been.

,Thetruthishere,"Last year I posted my possible abuction story with my youngest brother (Danny). Long story short, it was the scariest night of my life without seeing what we were up against. I felt it strengthened our sibling bond although I felt relieved at least one of us was spared.

While casually talking to my other [the spared] brother (Carl) about dreams, he said ""Hey remember that one time when we were young, I dreamed there were three kids in costume trying to corner me? It's so weird that it's so clear it feels like a memory."" I told him to describe the ""kids"" to us again, and as he did, his face started to twist into horror the same time as mine. His description was basically grey aliens and he just realized it after all these years!  He said there were three of them who have cornered him against the bedroom wall (one was holding a syringe). Somehow they were telling him to calm down because they just need a blood sample. So nope, no one was spared afterall.

That was how we got convinced 3/3 of us have most likely been abducted.

The other night, Carl texted me while I was at my girlfriend's. He was panicking because something was violently vibrating inside his leg. He said it was nothing like a spasm but more like a phone set in silent vibrating from a call. He said whatever it was felt tiny and couldn't be felt by his finger. He didn't tell Dan because he didn't want to scare him at midnight, being in the countryside practically alone with our grandma.

Just 3 hours after Carl's texts, Dan called me freaking out. He said something's vibrating inside his nape and described it exactly as Carl described his. 

There are also things that freak me out most likely related to our possible abduction:

-Our dad says since he was a kid he's been seeing blond people outside his window looking at him [he said they looked exactly like these](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTEX8s0hsePh-rOGicU8xxwLjMtFX0ht5eW5aLjO1mzKlLDmPvk). (Many reported abductees have ascendants or descendants who were observed as well. Maybe our dad's a subject too?) PS: We live in Asia

-Our paternal side of genetics is FUCKED UP. My dad came from at least 3 generations of inbreeding. (Wealthy European family in a colonial country, so for wealth-preservation). My clan is plagued by ultra rare cancers, physical deformities, and even internal mutations so my theory is we're being studied for this.

-We've been seeing UFOs since we were kids. One time, we had a new pretty powerful camera and we successfully shot tons of photos and videos of them. By morning, they were gone from the camera! Like somebody snuck in our house to delete JUST those proofs.

-Carl and I have insane streetlight interference. Streetlights turn off when we walk under them. Even streetlights that have been dead for months will turn on only during the moment we walk under them.

-In Dan's case, transistor radios go static when he goes near them.

,Thetruthishere,"Preface: Both my mom and I have talked to each other about having paranormal experiences. For the most part, they’ve been fairly tame—things like knocks on the wall late at night or hearing sudden groans while being home alone. One time however, while we were house searching, we were touring a house that had a room in the basement with a 3 ft hole in the wall that led to a pitch dark space. My little sister, 3 years old at the time, looks into the hole, waves, laughs and says hi with a giggle. Needless to say, we didn’t end up moving into that house.

One night, about 6 years later during my winter break from college, my mom and I were in the kitchen having a long conversation.

,Thetruthishere,"So to start, this all took place at my grandparents house. The house is fairly new but they have plenty of creepy, hundreds of years old, objects laying around. Some backstory on previous paranormal activity below: 
The only other weird things I can remember, other then what I will tell later on,  are that we played an ouija board a couple of times with no results, and my grandma had a old cabinet filled with very old random objects, like Indian smoke pipes, ancient Chinese bowls, skeleton keys, very old figures made of clay, just random old artifacts. The cabinet had a lock on it and was always locked. But for a period of time every time I came over the cabinet door would open half way, weirdly, I noticed it first, most of the time. I talked to them about it and they said it stays locked and only ever opens by itself when I come over. I just thought that was weird. It happen about 20 times.

But this time I saw something out of this world. 
So it started at around 1-4am, I never looked at the time so I can only assume how late it was. I was in my grandparents spare bedroom, and happened to wake up in the middle of the night.
I woke up, and heard my little brother crying from out in the living room, I thought, weird... 
He was sleeping on the couch btw. So I got up and walked out there and asked him why he was crying. He said someone was running up and down the basement stairs. I didn’t believe him but something was weird, off.. I felt like I couldn’t trust him. Something made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Normally me being the curious person I am I would have went into the kitchen, open the basement door and checked/searched for myself. I would rather know than not know. But this time was different. I just felt off, something was weird about the situation. 
So let me give you a layout of the house. I was standing in the living room facing the couch my brother was on, directly behind me was the hallway that led back to my room, straight in front of me to the right, past the couch, was the kitchen door way. into the kitchen to the right was the basement doorway, to the left was the dining room. 
After a couple of seconds i see something in my 
Peripheral view, I look into the kitchen door way. I see a figure run past from the left to the right. Towards the basement door. I barely saw it as it was fast and I only saw it at the last second. I mainly only saw an arm. It was black. Well an ashy black color. Very skinny. And held horizontally. It moved past the doorway and I froze. In shock. All my hair was standing up. I freaked out and yelled at my brother, telling him what I saw. I flipped. Ran back to my room and locked and barricaded the door. Ready to fight if I needed to. I stayed up all night just watching my door.

Next day rolls around and my brother doesn’t remember it, i told him what happened, I asked him why he was crying and he said he just wanted to fuck with me. Which was weird because he woke me up by crying. I wasn’t even awake, no one was. How could he have been fucking with me? I even saw a fucking figure. I told everyone and they all seemed to brush it off like it wasn’t a big deal. Accept my grandma, she told me about the many paranormal experiences she’s had over the years. Weird.
I know their house is haunted.

,Thetruthishere,"     I don't have a lot of memories from my past. I've undergone a lot of trauma in my childhood that I've blocked out. Yet, this one memory is something so vivid and clear I can detail what we saw that night.

     It all happened in my backyard. My parents had a big bonfire for the neighborhood back then almost once a week. But they soon got a tiny fire pit closer to the house for just our personal family time. My best friend was always invited since she was always around. I was around seventh going into eighth grade that summer. And we had just gotten the smaller pit.

     My mom, dad, sister, nephew, and best friend were roasting marshmallows and just enjoying the night. Talking and laughing and just having fun. All of a sudden a very white figure appeared in the corner of my eye. On instinct my head turned to look at whatever was so out of place in the dark night. 

     My heart raced like it never had before and my eyes went really wide. Breathing picking up as what I saw was a white saber tooth tiger. It had the black stripes accompanying it's white fur. It SAW me and I saw it. But when I blinked it calmly walked behind my neighbors dog fence and disappeared. 

     I went to turn away as I'm used to seeing these things. But usually alone. I was afraid my whole life until that point I was crazy. That I was seeing things. But when my head turned so I could go back to my family my eyes met my best friends.
     
     Her eyes were way more frightened than mine. And she whispered to me. 
     ""Did you see that?"" Too which I was honestly stunned and replied yes. She was terrified, more so than I. And that's when my mom asked what we were talking about. 
     So before I could answer she responded with EXACTLY my own description. I knew I wasn't just seeing things as she had only asked if I saw what she saw. 
     
     My mom told us we were seeing things. No one else saw the white mass we did. They just saw darkness. We still talk about whatever it was. And she is still terrified to talk about it.

,Thetruthishere,"So I saw a post in here just now about how this person was thinking of a place and their fiancé was able to guess it without anything being said as to where or what the place was and it reminded me of this thing that my friends and I used to do back in high school. 

My friends and I have always been very interested in the more psychic abilities that are me could possible have and we read this article in nice that said if you focus hard enough you can transfer thoughts (it gets easier the more you do it kinda thing) so of course we were curious and decided to test this out in class one day. 

Since we had a class together we each chose one person to try and connect with to see if it would work. No one said anything or did anything to give away who the person was. The key was to pretty much focus (don’t stare at them directly because people can feel that) and imagine a link of sorts going from your third eye to theirs and then imagine you sending a message or something to them. 

I decided to try this on someone who was sitting in front of me but to the left. That way I could see him but not have to be staring at him to do this. I decided to say turn around in my head to see if he would do it. The first time I did it nothing happened, he just say there. The second time he looked up from his own paper he was working on and the third time he turned his head to look to the back of the class, obviously confused as to why. 

Now, all of us tried this and had similar things happen. It took at least two tries for the person to react but they did do whatever it was we had thought in our heads (turn around, look at whatever object do this or that kinda thing. Stuff that isn’t typical movements of students I guess)

We used to do this kind of stuff all the time. It was interesting to see if it would work. It was like we were strengthening our third eyes. We even did this to each other. From what I remember when they would do it to me is that the first few times someone does it you can’t really tell the difference between you thinking it yourself and them sending the message. But if that person does it a few times you can identify their voice/energy.

“A 13 year old boy was killed this past Tuesday in Knott county KY. I’ve been following the stories trying to stitch together the evidence to make some sense of it all. He was staying at a relatives house and familiar with the area. Playing in the back yard, relative called 911 at 6:pm saying the boy was being attacked by a canine type creature. First responders on site at 6:30, the 911 caller directed them up the mountain behind the house. They had difficulty getting up the mountainside because of the steep slick terrain but found the boy dead 300-400 feet straight up the rain slick mountain. State trooper reported “something is out there” coroner confirmed boy was killed by a canine type creature but can’t identify what exactly. The latest reports are “canine creature”.
No wolves in KY for decades. A full grown 40lb coyote can’t drag a 100lb dead body up a mountainside. No mountain lions in KY. A feral dog or even several feral dogs aren’t dragging 100 lbs of dead weight up a mountainside, Not a bear, coroner has determined cause of death to be a “canine type creature”. The funeral was yesterday. I have communicated with the relative who set up the go fund me page and three different reporters. All say “canine creature”. Coroner has had ample time to test dna, known animals would be easily identified but they aren’t saying what it was that killed the boy. A bear or mountain lion are the only two animals I know of that could kill a human and have the strength to drag him 100 yds up a rain slick mountainside. But it wasn’t a bear or mountain lion, coroner said canine creature killed him. Authorities are asking neighbors to be “hyper vigilant” of their surroundings.
Google 13 yr old boy killed by animal attack KY.
The story will most likely fade to black with no official ID of the animal or creature that killed him.”

Copy and pasted from a Facebook post. A young boy was killed here less than a hour from me. They keep saying “canine creature” but no one knows for sure. It’s rained near continuously so the terrain is so muddy it would be almost impossible to climb up a mountain side that he was found deceased on. “Canine creature” cannot be located. It was thought that it was a “pack of dogs” or “pack of coyotes” but neither pack has been located.

,Thetruthishere,"When I was 16 my mother heard me talking in my sleep so she came in to check on me since this wasn't very common of me. She claims she saw what was a large shadow like figure make it's way across my room, but convinced herself that it was probably her mind playing tricks on her since my room was already so dark. She saw that I was fine so she went back to her room and forgot about the situation. 
Well, not 30 minutes or so later I woke up. It was pitch black, I looked towards my bedroom door and notice it slowly begin to creak open by itself. I called out to my mother assuming it was her and immediately after see a large black hazy figure enter my room through the door and glide across the wall until it reached a corner of my room where I lost sight of it. Mind you my room was dark, but the figure was oddly distinguishable. My mother heard my call and immediately knew what I what I had seen, almost like an ""I knew it"" realization. We turned on the lights and I told her what I saw and that's when she told me that she'd seen the figure when she came in to check on me earlier. Our shocked reactions woke up my father and younger brother. It was around 3 am or so by then. We didn't sleep that night and spent the rest of the early morning until sunrise trying to comprehend what we'd just witnessed.
What's interesting about this is, our house isn't known to be haunted. An incident like this never happened before and hasn't happened since, which only makes this even weirder in my opinion. 

I know this story is questionable, but I swear to this day It happened. We still talk about It from time to time.

Ask me anything, make your own interpretations/possible explanations, I do not mind.

,Thetruthishere,"Okay so a while back I posted these stories on a subreddit somewhere, I can't remember which, but I posted it under a different account. I can't remember the login info so I made a new one. I thought I would make a new post with those experiences as well as some new ones.

We moved into my stepdad's house when he and my mom got married. It was him, my mom, my brother and I. My brother has since moved in with our dad, but he only lives about 20 min away. A long time ago my stepdad dreamed about a little girl in Victorian-Era clothing running around the hallway of the house. My mom and I occasionally hear something and we don't know what, so we've attributed these happenings to the little ghost girl my stepdad saw in his dream, and we affectionately call her Emma.

My brother (six years younger than me) used to get night terrors. I would wake up in the middle of the night and hear him whimpering or crying in his sleep, sometimes even talking. He would sometimes say he could hear a noise, almost like a vibration, only in his room.

I was home alone one day, and I was going through a phase where I was into ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and I was singing (badly). I heard a deep voice say ""STOP"".

Another time I was home alone and heard footsteps in the attic. 

My stepdad is a smoker and has been for years, and he very often will make a short ""coughing"" noise. Like a cross between coughing and clearing his throat. It's a very distinctive sound. When I was home alone, I heard that sound come from their bedroom. He was at work. 

Most recently my mom was in the kitchen and I was in the living room. It's an open floor plan so we can be in those rooms but still see each other and talk to one another. My mom was sweeping and she had set the dustpan on the counter. It wasn't close the the edge. We were talking and all of a sudden the dustpan FLIPPED off of the counter. Not just fell. It was as if someone unseen had come up and popped the handle of the dustpan to make it flip in the air and hit the ground.

Also, my mom and I have both seen ""faces"" and figures out of the corners of our eyes. This last part isn't really ""paranormal"" like the rest but it's still creepy. This doesn't always happen but we have a big window behind our table, and the sun will sometimes cast a reflection from the light fixture on the ceiling. It looks like a face, sinister almost. I'll try to link a picture! We know it isn't anything sinister or paranormal, but it is creepy looking.

,Thetruthishere,"I tagged along for one of many excursions into the woods to assist in a Wiccan friend’s ritual. He was my mentor and later on, my coven founder. 

Anyhow, this was about 2 years ago one fall evening. The sun was just going down and it was supposed to be a special moon phase (I can’t remember exactly, blood moon or maybe just full) and he had planned out to do a short ritual at the nearby park we always frequented at night. He needed assistance as it was a time-based ritual so I obliged. 

We went out into the hiking trails and found a spot suitable to not be disturbed by passerbys. To give a layout, we sat down sideways on the path, the woods both in front of and behind us with the trail going left and right. 

We got everything set up and a loud crunch came somewhere in the distance straight ahead of us in the deep woods. I confirmed that he heard it too and we both dismissed it. He lights the candles and begins doing his thing when we hear it again, but a good distance closer. At this point I’m getting a little freaked out as I wasn’t used to anything occult. I thought someone was messing with us until I heard a deep, guttural growl from behind us a fair distance.  The sun was just barely putting forth anymore light at this point, the only visible source being the candles. He began to feel uneasy as well so we hurried his ritual up and packed everything away. As we were about to leave, one more thick snap came from the woods right in front of us, maybe 20 ft down in the ditch. At that point we basically fast-walked our way out. 

We came back to check it out a few days later and a bunch of adult-sized trees were completely uprooted with huge gashes on the trunks. No footprints in the mud either. The last storm was maybe 2 weeks ago and these were freshly ripped out of the ground.

,Thetruthishere,"Okay I’m so glad I found this subreddit because ever since I was a child I have had various odd encounters and now I finally have a place to open up about them and share. This post is going to be about very vivid dreams I have before the death of someone I know. 

I’m in college now but from the age of 9 through 17 I went to a music camp a few hours from my house in the mountains in the middle of nowhere. I loved it every year was magical and it was all thanks to a very old woman who owned the property with her husband since the 50’s. Anyways she was very elderly and her oldest son lived with her and he was also very old. 

He ends up passing away beginning of the semester in August from long term illness and complications. I didn’t know him very well he only conducted for the most advanced students who I wasn’t grouped with until my last few years. I can’t remember the days of the week exactly but for ease I’ll say I had a very long and difficult dream on Monday night. I can’t remember the details of it very clearly but I remember waking up in the middle of the night panting as if I had been holding my breath, hot, heart pounding, and a sense of dread so bad I had to turn my lights on just to be sure there wasn’t a maniac about to stab me. I manage to go back to sleep and continue my routine on Tuesday as if it hadn’t happened. I later find out Friday that he had died late Monday night/early Tuesday morning. It was sad news that hit but I also got hit realizing that I had woken up panicking the same night. 

Fast forward to winter break and I have a similar dream and wake up panting and gasping, hot, disoriented, and scared again. This time it was actually Friday morning around 2am cause I checked my phone to use the flashlight to scan my room and make sure I was safe. I go back to sleep and wake up to texts from friends in several different states who had gone to camp with me— the sweet old woman who had cofounded the camp had passed early in the morning. This time it hit even harder that I had the dream again. 

Last instance: I had a neighbor who lived across the street and over one house to the left who I’d seen as a kid but as I grew older I had started to forget what she looked like and her voice and such. This was after high school I was about 20 then and it had been years since I’d had any bad dreams like the ones I’d had with the camp founding family. Anyways it was summer and my mom comes in and asks if I’d be willing to help our neighbor since she’d recently had a stroke and her family was all out of state at that point and I had been looking bored and why don’t I just go do it. So I do and we have a blast and set up a routine. Every Monday I take her grocery shopping and every Thursday I go in and visit with her, cook, be generally silly it was honestly a highlight looking back at it. 

So I’m leaving Thursday and she says she’ll call me if she needs me Monday because some people had known about her condition and brought her food and goodies and she doesn’t know if she needs to shop again so soon. I go home and forget relatively soon she’d said anything like that. Then Saturday night I have another horrid dream and wake up as usual: panting, hot, scared. Now since it had been a few years since the last dreams at this scale I don’t immediately put it together but it’s the weekend and still summer vacation so I just kick my sheet off and finish my night. 

Then Monday rolls around and she doesn’t call and I remember that maybe she doesn’t need me. I let it slide I go out with friends that night. Then Thursday comes and no call to come over so I think maybe she’s got someone else or she’s tired or whatever. Next Monday rolls around and I get no call so I go over and ring the bell and call her phone and it goes to voicemail. She also keeps her car in the garage and has a fence that keeps you from going up the front door and knocking so I have no idea if the car is it isn’t there and I can’t peek into her living room or kitchen cause the locked fence. I go home and wait for Thursday which comes and goes with no news so I figure she’s “dumped” me and gotten an actual caretaker or something. 

It’s not till two weeks after I’d seen her last my mom breaks the news that while I was asleep she had seen the ambulance and police outside and they’d taken her body to a morgue. She had died two weeks prior when I had my last horrific dream from another stroke and had been in the house ever since till her son had come to check on her. I was the last person to see or speak to her alive. 

I’m sorry for such a long post but I needed to tell it as best I could. To anyone reading this have you had similar experiences? Would this be called premonition or clairvoyance? I’m only so dumbfounded cause I had very minimal relationships to the people I had these dreams with before their passing. With the exception of my neighbor.

I was the last person to see or speak to her alive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry for such a long post but I needed to tell it as best I could. To anyone reading this have you had similar experiences? Would this be called premonition or clairvoyance? I’m only so dumbfounded cause I had very minimal relationships to the people I had these dreams with before their passing. With the exception of my neighbor. Any comments or questions I welcome fully. Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Many   things have been said on aspects of magic, the paranormal, the   supernatural, the soul. Many things have been said on these subjects   indeed, and most of those things said include words such as “hogwash”,   “hullabaloo”, “smoke-and-mirrors”, “fraudulent”, and “bullshit”; these   select words have been said by both the common layman as well as his   academic counterpart, men of science, reason, intelligence, all of them   look upon ideas of magic and sorcery as bunk, fairy-tales for overly   imaginative children, to be given absolutely zero consideration,   recommendation, or investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

Ladies and gentlemen, I tell you today that *this*   is bunk. This attitude is hogwash. This scoffing is hullabaloo. This   hand waving is smoke-and-mirrors. This judgement is fraudulent. This   assertion by so called men of science and reason that these aspects of   reality cannot possibly exist is utter bullshit; and today I shall prove   it to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Though, you must accept two caveats from the get-go.

1:   Forgive me, for I myself am not a powerful enough sorcerer to throw   your room into a sty to prove telekinesis, nor tell you what you are   thinking eleven times out of ten.

And 2: Fret not, for I can teach sorcery to you, and let you be the judge of your own ability.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First   and foremost, to practice magic you must believe in magic. The skeptic   may scoff, again, finding it silly that something must be believed in  to  be effective, but I would remind that skeptic that to achieve the   greatest feats in skill, athleticism, or genius, you must first believe   you can achieve them. No athlete would tell you with a straight face   that they perform well even if they don't believe they will; they   absolutely must have the right mentality for them to perform to   standard. It is no different with painters, musicians, architects, or   anyone who must chronically hit deadlines. To be successful they must   first be able to visualize their success coming to fruition, they must   believe they can do it, first and foremost, before they will be able to   do it. The Law of Attraction outlines this well, and if you do not know   what that is, the shorthand of it is as follows: The more you believe   something will happen, the more likely it is to actually happen. Not   just inside your body either, but outside, effecting the very world   around you. The idea that, if you just focus hard enough, you can   literally will things into existence, whether it is opportunities to   advance your position, resources in order to better yourself or status,   or more simple things like good luck, friendship, and love. 'The   Secret', a book by Rhonda Byrne, outlines this principle and how it   works perfectly, and while it first may seem outlandish, many famous and   exceptional people have themselves written about it, attesting to it,   and urging others to follow it; such obvious loons including: Plato,   Leonardo DaVinci, Galileo, Napoleon, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas   Edison, Einstein, and Andrew Carnegie, as well as being written about   and referenced either directly or indirectly in self-help books by Paulo   Cohelo, Charels Haneel, Wallace D. Wattles, and James Allen. All of  the  aforementioned believing the Law of Attraction having, at least, a   significant impact in their success, or at most, attributing their   successes to the law almost entirely, Mr.Wattles himself being one of   the biggest advocates for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Even   if you phoo phoo these old timers for their nonsense and obviously   nonsensical ways, you would do well to know that most famous and   overwhelmingly successful people living today have considered themselves   apprentices to this exact line of thinking and the books written upon   it. They believed in it with the weight of their life, and in return it   gave them their life.

&amp;#x200B;

This   fits perfectly into the next part of my theorem: The Placebo Effect.   When most people hear of the Placebo Effect, they think of sugar pills,   fake medicine, things doctors give patients to either check if they're   faking or to send them on their way without a fuss, but this is little   more than hear-say. In truth, the Placebo Effect is one of the most   interesting and deeply looked into phenomena's in medical science.

&amp;#x200B;

In   simple terms, those who believe themselves well become well, and those   who believe themselves sick become sick. How does this work? If the  body  can just 'make' itself well, why doesn't it? That's the mystery.  But  the fact remains, it has been proven time and again that patients  who  are given sugar pills or false serums and told that it will make  them  well not only become healthier, but even in tests where the  recipient is  *told* they are being given Placebo's, they *still* feel better; simply for the fact of having been given a pill by men in white lab coats in a pristine environment.

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth noting that I'm not talking purely about symptoms. These people don't just 'feel' better, they *get*   better. To quote Erik Vance, Biologist and author of “Susceptible  You”,  a chronicle of his own studies on the Placebo Effect, there are   numerous cases of the Placebo Effect alone healing such illnesses as   Parkinson's, Chronic Pain, IBS, Depression, Anxiety, certain types of   Asthma, and even Auto-Immune Deficiencies. Many medicines are just as   psychological as they are physical remedies, hence why the good doctor   always tells you this won't hurt a bit, because it's been proven time   and again that if he does not, it hurts far more.

&amp;#x200B;

It   is even worth noting that the act of Visualizing in and of itself has   been studied with extreme scrutiny, to the point where it's been   revealed that visualizing an action has the same effect on the brain as   physically performing an action (this is something many elite and   Olympian level athletes, including Emily Cook of the U.S Ski Team,   Lyndon Rush of the Canadian Bobsled Team, Al Oerter, four time Discus   champion, Billie Jean King, Tennis star, Lindsey Vonn of the U.S Alpine   Skiers, Manchester Football Players Wayne Rooney, Jonny Wilkinson and   Andy Murray. Former Olympian Swimmer for the U.S team Micheal Phelps,   Boxer Connor McGregor, and even Muhammad Ali all attest to the power of   visualization as well. They did it nigh constantly, visualizing their   training, their strokes, their moves, and their techniques when taking   breaks from physical training. Sports Psychologists who look after these   same Olympians recommend it themselves, including Dr.Micheal Gervais  of  the NFL, Nicole Detling, for the U.S team, and Britt Tajet-Foxell  for  the Norwegian team).

&amp;#x200B;

And yes -- the Placebo Effect actually healing people HAS interfered with hundreds of studies for new medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To give this yet more basis in reality, the opposite is also true; colloquially known as the “Nocebo Effect”.

&amp;#x200B;

Some   time ago there was a study on something called “Hypersounds” -- noises   which are too loud to consciously pick up on, but when they press on   your inner ear, they cause rapid onset of headaches and migraines. The   thing is, they don't exist... or rather, the symptoms from them does   not. Yet many who participated in the study found they actually   developed the symptoms mentioned. Just as Placebos were discovered   through drug-trials where those given fake pills actually had their   symptoms and sickness alleviated, Nocebos were discovered by people   suffering the nasty side effects that come with many medicines -- the   very medicines they didn't take. Once more, it is worth noting this   wasn't just psychological phenomena. Nocebo's actually do hurt. They   have a very real, very physical effect on the body, including   inflammation, rashes, bruises, nausea, headaches, hosts of symptoms   associated with general sickness, depression, insomnia, difficulty   breathing, withdrawal, and even addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet   again one might scoff and try to disprove these studies by claiming   they are just cases of misattribution. Everyone can have a good (or off)   day, so when they have one whilst taking X drug (or fake drug), they   put blame on the drug. I will myself confirm that yes, this does happen,   but the Placebo Effect wouldn't be so popular or so deeply studied if   it were ALL cases of misattribution. In fact, Placebo's (and Nocebo's)   are so effective that it is estimated that upwards of 70%+ of all   recovery or degradation occurs strictly because of said phenomena. This   is not to say that medicine is largely useless, mind; only that any   medicine at all will be hard pressed to heal you if you are absolutely   convinced you will remain as sick as a dog, and likewise any sickness   will be hard pressed to keep you down if you are absolutely convinced a   good night's rest will make you chipper as a chipmunk.

&amp;#x200B;

To   make matters more confusing still, there are also “Placebo Blockers”.   If you are given a Placebo and told it will give you a rash, and then   secretly given real medicine which specifically reduces rashes, the   recipients had no or very minor rashes, compared to those who were not   given the Blockers. Likewise, if you were given medicine that actually   causes rashes as a side effect, and then given a placebo that mitigates   those symptoms, you would be in the same boat as the aforementioned,   having little to no symptoms despite their frequency in patients without   the Blockers.

&amp;#x200B;

In   either, any, and all cases, the bottom line is that it is the raw   belief that matters. The greater the conviction, the greater the   real-world effect. It doesn't even have to be just one person:   Mass-Hysteria, Mass-Psychogenic-Illness, Mass-Hypnosis, Mass-Psychosis,   and even that weird dancing plague that happened in Europe during the   14th-to-17th century are all related to Placebos, and all of them have   real, physical, bodily effects.

&amp;#x200B;

If seeing is believing, then here we can clearly deduce that the reverse is also true.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Which glides just perfectly into my next topic: Hallucinations.

&amp;#x200B;

Sufferers   of hallucinations will tell you outright that there is no fool-proof   way to tell when a hallucination is, in fact, a hallucination other than   the outlandishness of the situation, or how out of place the   hallucination might be. It is easy to know when you are hallucinating a   voice at 2 A.M when no one else is around, but there is no way to tell   when you are if you are walking through a crowded hall. It is easy to   know you are hallucinating an alien, but not so much if it is just a man   as like to any other. Indeed, those who have frequent or infrequent   hallucinations will tell you that they are not just sight and sound, but   can even be taste, smell, and touch. Hallucinations can, in fact, be   tactile, and you would be unable to tell which is which if you shook a   man's hand, so indistinguishable it would be from the regular sensation   of a handshake. Keep in mind hallucinations do not always overlap; some   are only auditory, while others are purely olfactory; yet they always *can*   overlap, and it becomes extremely distressing when it does; especially   when you learn that hallucinations can actually cause you pain. From   feeling the sensation of creepy-crawlies climbing up your back, to   suddenly feeling as if you had been pinched or pricked with needles, or   even the extremely distressing scenario of hallucinating a full blown   attack or mugging, where you can actually feel as if you've been   stabbed, though it is admittedly rare (with only a rough 20% of   hallucinations being tactile). The symptoms are similar to that of Sleep   Paralysis, wherein many sufferers report that sensations caused by the   hallucinations have a real and lasting effect on the body even after   fully waking (such as the pain of a compressed chest, being unable to   breathe, whilst hallucinating that an extremely heavy thing is on top of   you).

&amp;#x200B;

Phantom   Limb Pain is a similar issue, the feeling of pain and discomfort in a   limb that has been previously amputated; note: You are not feeling the   pain of the amputation, you are feeling as if the limb that is no  longer  there is, itself, in pain; as if you lit a match over an open  area and  your brain interpreted it as being held under your arm.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet   again this seems far-fetched until I remind you, dear reader, that you   yourself have likely hallucinated similar things when you dream; for   nearly all of us have had a dream that was chock full of sensations of   sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch that we could only imagine, such as   how it feels to fly, or something so beautiful it made us slack jawed.   So small are the amount of times we actually realize we are dreaming;   how strange, is it not? That no matter how surreal or fantastic   something is in comparison to our normal reality; our brain treats it as   if we walked out the door onto Jupiter for our regular Tuesday jaunt.

&amp;#x200B;

Always   keep this in mind: this, all of this you are experiencing right now,   none of it is purely a physical sensation. Even the pain we discussed is   a mental stimulation, not a physical one. It is your brain, not your   body, that tells you when you are hurt. Much like with dreams, I'm sure   you can recall experiences where a sudden sensation or shock causes you   acute pain for a moment before you realize you aren't actually hurt  (as  it has me), or the opposite, where you feel no pain until you look  and  see a wound on your body that you cannot recall receiving, and  suddenly  it begins hurting (as it has me). Pain is a mental  stimulation, but it  doesn't stop at the mere sensation of pain either;  cases of spontaneous  combustion, spontaneous wounds appearing on the  body, Stigmata (the  manifestation of religiously significant wounds on  the body), and even  the simple fact of an absurd amount of people going  online to talk about  wounds, whether scratches, bruises, fire, or even  acidic, appearing on  the body with no idea as to how they could have  gotten there, are all  recorded, yet under-researched and  under-examined. While it may be true  that a good portion of these cases  are faked, the mere fact that wounds  have shown up with no external  cause and seemingly no underlying medical  issue, simply because you  believe in it, is enough to raise a fuss.

&amp;#x200B;

But   this is all just conjecture, isn't it? This is all just hypothesis,   metaphysical, none of it is actually proven. So, I suppose I will have   to give actual proof, won't I.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Amou   Haji is a very interesting Iranian man. When interviewed about the way   he lived, he revealed that, as a young chap in his early 20's, he   encountered some 'emotional setbacks' which caused him to view the world   in an entirely different way than most, believing that being clean   causes sickness, and being dirty leads to health. Since then, he has   never showered, bathed, or cleaned himself in any way. He eats only   rotten meat (Entirely roadkill or the remains of any dead animal,   seemingly without any veggies at all), and drinks water only from his   rusted oil can. He's a chain smoker, alternating between smoking animal   feces from his large clay pipe, or regular cigarettes, five at a time.   He sleeps in a simple hole in the ground on the outskirts of his town  (a  village called Dejgah in the southern province of Fars), reminiscent  of  a grave, and for the harsh Iranian winters, wears only a metal  helmet  on top of his usual, never changing, rags to keep himself warm.  As  mentioned, he does all of this because he believes being dirty is  what  leads to health, and while his idea seems first laughable and  borderline  lunatic, you may want to give him more credit, for he has  lived this  way for over 60 years. Indeed, at the time of this writing,  Mr. Haji is  84 years old. You could doubt his claims that he has lived  this way  since early adulthood, but looking at pictures of the bloke,  it's easy  to see that if he's telling a fib, he and his village are the  most  dedicated liars on the planet. Yes, his village too, for all of  them  corroborate his story and agree that he has lived this way longer  than  many of them have been alive.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, the average lifespan for a male in Iran is 72. 72.5 if you really want to be a stickler.

&amp;#x200B;

Why?   What? How could this possibly be? People get sick of tetanus from a   splinter and die, and this man has been ingesting rotten, parasite   ridden food, rust from his cup, dirt in every orifice, blackening his   lungs from the constant smoking, never brushing his teeth, eating only   with his dirt caked hands, never so much as properly wiping his ass, and   he has never gotten sick.

&amp;#x200B;

He has never gotten sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Since   adopting this lifestyle, he has reported no sickness, nor has anyone  in  his village called him a liar. He has all his limbs, all his fingers   and toes, he is not blind, not hard of hearing, able to outrun the  grown  men who sometimes chase him to try to give him a bath, and is  seemingly  perfectly sound of mind (as sound of mind as most people  would regard a  man living in his condition, anyways), responding  reasonably and with  lucidity to any and all interviews given to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite   this disease-ridden lifestyle, he is untouched by it. Despite   everything our mothers tell us, our doctors tell us, our teachers tell   us, our biologists tell us, every single thing revolving around health,   nutrition, and wellness, he adheres to none of it, the exact opposite  of  all of it, and he has lived longer than most men and women in his   entire nation.

&amp;#x200B;

In   fact, he's lived longer than most men the world over. As of 2015 the   highest life expectancy on Earth for men is in Switzerland at 81.3.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no doubt he will live longer still.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why.   Why is he able to live like this for so long, still so robust in his   health, you may ask. Why, dear reader, haven't you been listening? It's   because he *believes* he is   healthy. He believes his lifestyle makes him the healthiest man alive,   and so he lives as stout as if he really were. His faith and conviction   are so strong in this regard that the Placebo Effect is unstoppable,   eradicating all sickness within him and keeping him in good shape,   greater than any average man of his age. Likewise, I have no doubt that   if he actually were forced to bathe, it truly would kill him.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet   again, the skeptic would probably mumble something about him gaining  an  immunity from so many diseases through the harsh lifestyle with  which  he's lived...but wouldn't that prove my point anyways? That so  many have  died from sickness so little while he, such an old man, still  thrives  because he believes he will.

&amp;#x200B;

Are   you feeling like you're tipping on the edge of a precipice by now?   Don't worry, I'll toss you right into the abyss myself, for here we   examine physics and the defects of the human brain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The   Double-Slit Experiment is a very famous, and relatively obscure,   example of just how strange the universe actually is. You should do   yourself a favour and delve into it on your own time, both for how   interesting it is and for the fact that you will learn far more, but to   save time I will give you the jist of it: Particles behave differently   when being observed vs. when they are left to their own devices. In the   early 20th century, an experiment was done firing particles out of a   canon to see how they interacted with the environment (specifically to   see whether they behaved as a wave, hitting all areas with lower and   higher intensity, respectively, or as solids, hitting some areas 100% of   the time while avoiding others 100% of the time. They did this by   setting up a wall with two slits in it and set it between the shooter   and the backboard). It behaved as a wave, and some folks were displeased   with this result, believing it was because the particles, all being   fired at once, were interfering with eachother's course of direction by   bouncing off one another. They repeated the experiment, but this time   firing only one particle at a time, rather than in large bursts, and the   particles behaved...as a wave. No interference, through only two  slits,  it created a wave pattern, which would be similar to you  throwing a  tennis ball through one of two holes in the wall and seeing  the dent the  ball made off of the backboard as if it hit five separate  locations at  once, none of which in the direction you threw it in. The  physicists  concluded that the particles, being in super-position (that  is to say,  capable of doing multiple, seemingly contradicting things,  at the same  time), were actually bouncing off of themselves, thus  creating the  pattern. To see how they were doing this, the physicists  tried to  directly observe the experiment, only for the particles to  behave, well,  as particles. Throwing a ball through one of two holes  and seeing the  dent on the backboard in exactly the areas you threw it  in. The very act  of observing, measuring, trying to find out which one  it would go  through, collapsed the super-position, 'forcing' the  particle to have to  choose which slit to go through. If this all sounds  very confusing,  that's because it is. “Truth is stranger than fiction”  and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

To   better understand Super-Position, and the collapsing of it, I would   direct you to Shrodinger's Cat: A philosophical experiment regarding   this very thing. The idea being that, if you put a cat in a box with a   vial of poison that MAY break in five minutes, and close the box, that   cat is now in super-position. It is fully capable of 'being' either   alive or dead at the same time. The idea being, until you open the box   and see for certain, the possibility of the cat being either alive or   dead is equal; it is effectively both and neither. By opening the box,   you 'collapse' the super-position, 'forcing' the universe to choose   between whether the cat is objectively living or objectively dead.   Particles, because of their obeying the laws of quantum physics rather   than our regular type, are in a state of super-position that actually   ALLOWS them to do multiple, contradictory things at once; perhaps   equatable to hearing both the cat slump over dead and the cat tramp   around meowing, still alive. The particles behave as if there were   clones of it doing other things simultaneously, even though no such   clones exist. It is only when you observe the particles that they are   unable to do this, being only one, and thus behaving as if there were   only one.

&amp;#x200B;

This   is a very important thing to note, for despite having to do with   quantum physics, and thus obeying a set of universal rules we, as   giants, rarely have to worry about; it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt   that the act of participating in something, even if merely by watching   it, changes the way the universe, atoms, and our reality works. “You   cannot prove there isn't a very quiet elephant just outside of your   field of vision at all times”. It proves that reality is malleable,   being able to be shaped and molded depending on how you see it, or even   if you see it, or where you are seeing it from. This is compounded on   top of issues previously touched upon, of hallucinations, dreams, and   even phantom sensations. It will be compounded further still.

&amp;#x200B;

The   brain is imperfect, as everyone knows, but it is still more imperfect   than anyone knows. We trust our brains absolutely, only because we have   no choice, but whether in double-blind studies, tests, tricks, or  simple  party games and illusions we all so easily fall prey to, it is  shown  just how easily brains can err. Memories are nigh always wrong,  whether  rose tinted or altered in some way, hence why reports from  eyewitnesses  to crimes are so ineffective. Memories are not only wrong  but can even  be falsely implanted. People, whether due to increased  stress, peer  pressure, or repeated coaxing, can begin to form vivid  memories of  things that never happened so accurately that the same  synapses are  shown to fire off when thinking of them as they would when  recalling a  favourite childhood memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Your   eyes are riddled with blind spots, whether it's the dots you cannot  see  and your brain just automatically fills them in for you with what  it  believes ought to be there, or the fact that your eyes constantly  see  your nose and just phase it out. Hallucinations are easy to induce;  you  could do so by starring into a mirror in the dark with nothing but  a dim  candle flame and in about 10 minutes you will see all kinds of  odd and  silly things floating right behind you. The most glaring fault  is the  fact that everything you see is actually upside-down. Light from  above  you hits the bottom of your retina, and light from below you  hits the  top, meaning that everything below you would be seen as above  you and  everything above you would be seen as below you, but your brain  just  corrects it for you. We've already discussed the Placebo Effect  and  Hallucinations, and the implications it has on how your brain  interprets  the world around you, as well as the universe itself, which  depends  upon observation from this faulty brain to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I   tell you all this in order to prove that nothing is so concrete or  real  as we imagine it to be. Indeed, it is purely out of convenience  and  because we need SOME foundation to stand on that we treat the laws  of  the universe as we do, rather than as the mere suggestion that they   truly are, so often breaking down and changing when you grow too big or   too small, or get too close to a black hole; when you dream, your  brain  treats it as an alternate reality, but we also rely upon it to  tell us  what reality is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing   all this, I have a question to ask you. Knowing that needing to  believe  in something for it to work is a commonly accepted practice,  knowing  how many put such faith into the Law of Attraction, knowing the  Placebo  Effect causes real, measurable changes in the physical body,  knowing  that visualization has the same effect on your body as the  imagined  activity does, knowing that imagined hallucinations can  trigger the  exact same sensations as true-to-life stimuli, knowing that  the  interpretation of our reality is a mental process, and how faulty  our  mental processes truly are, on top of how faulty our reality truly  is,  knowing absolutely, with unshakable proof, that a firm conviction  is  enough to seemingly disregard commonly held laws of biology,  physics,  and nature, knowing all of this, I ask you one question.

&amp;#x200B;

If   I believed I held a fireball in my hands, to hear its crackling and   believe in it as I believe in the air I breathe, and you believed I held   a fireball in my hands, feeling the heat come off it as if it would   blister your skin and feeling the pain of its light searing your   retinas, and I lobbed it at you, what do you think would happen?

&amp;#x200B;

This   is magic, true magic, and the basis of all spell-work to follow. More   than being real as it is, with what we just discussed, it does not even  *have*  to be 'real' to have any  true to life effect. As a matter of fact, I  think at this point, it's  rather ridiculous judging something by how  'real' it is at all, don't  you think?

&amp;#x200B;

The old mystics wrote that with faith, one could move mountains. I don't know if they realized how correct they truly were.",t2_5akuploq,False,,0,False,The Effects of Perception upon Reality (and further proofs of magic),[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,dis,0,False,t3_f88gyd,False,dark,,public,170,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion/Advice,False,170,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1582487192.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many   things have been said on aspects of magic, the paranormal, the   supernatural, the soul. Many things have been said on these subjects   indeed, and most of those things said include words such as “hogwash”,   “hullabaloo”, “smoke-and-mirrors”, “fraudulent”, and “bullshit”; these   select words have been said by both the common layman as well as his   academic counterpart, men of science, reason, intelligence, all of them   look upon ideas of magic and sorcery as bunk, fairy-tales for overly   imaginative children, to be given absolutely zero consideration,   recommendation, or investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, I tell you today that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;   is bunk. This attitude is hogwash. This scoffing is hullabaloo. This   hand waving is smoke-and-mirrors. This judgement is fraudulent. This   assertion by so called men of science and reason that these aspects of   reality cannot possibly exist is utter bullshit; and today I shall prove   it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, you must accept two caveats from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:   Forgive me, for I myself am not a powerful enough sorcerer to throw   your room into a sty to prove telekinesis, nor tell you what you are   thinking eleven times out of ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 2: Fret not, for I can teach sorcery to you, and let you be the judge of your own ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First   and foremost, to practice magic you must believe in magic. The skeptic   may scoff, again, finding it silly that something must be believed in  to  be effective, but I would remind that skeptic that to achieve the   greatest feats in skill, athleticism, or genius, you must first believe   you can achieve them. No athlete would tell you with a straight face   that they perform well even if they don&amp;#39;t believe they will; they   absolutely must have the right mentality for them to perform to   standard. It is no different with painters, musicians, architects, or   anyone who must chronically hit deadlines. To be successful they must   first be able to visualize their success coming to fruition, they must   believe they can do it, first and foremost, before they will be able to   do it. The Law of Attraction outlines this well, and if you do not know   what that is, the shorthand of it is as follows: The more you believe   something will happen, the more likely it is to actually happen. Not   just inside your body either, but outside, effecting the very world   around you. The idea that, if you just focus hard enough, you can   literally will things into existence, whether it is opportunities to   advance your position, resources in order to better yourself or status,   or more simple things like good luck, friendship, and love. &amp;#39;The   Secret&amp;#39;, a book by Rhonda Byrne, outlines this principle and how it   works perfectly, and while it first may seem outlandish, many famous and   exceptional people have themselves written about it, attesting to it,   and urging others to follow it; such obvious loons including: Plato,   Leonardo DaVinci, Galileo, Napoleon, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas   Edison, Einstein, and Andrew Carnegie, as well as being written about   and referenced either directly or indirectly in self-help books by Paulo   Cohelo, Charels Haneel, Wallace D. Wattles, and James Allen. All of  the  aforementioned believing the Law of Attraction having, at least, a   significant impact in their success, or at most, attributing their   successes to the law almost entirely, Mr.Wattles himself being one of   the biggest advocates for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even   if you phoo phoo these old timers for their nonsense and obviously   nonsensical ways, you would do well to know that most famous and   overwhelmingly successful people living today have considered themselves   apprentices to this exact line of thinking and the books written upon   it. They believed in it with the weight of their life, and in return it   gave them their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This   fits perfectly into the next part of my theorem: The Placebo Effect.   When most people hear of the Placebo Effect, they think of sugar pills,   fake medicine, things doctors give patients to either check if they&amp;#39;re   faking or to send them on their way without a fuss, but this is little   more than hear-say. In truth, the Placebo Effect is one of the most   interesting and deeply looked into phenomena&amp;#39;s in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In   simple terms, those who believe themselves well become well, and those   who believe themselves sick become sick. How does this work? If the  body  can just &amp;#39;make&amp;#39; itself well, why doesn&amp;#39;t it? That&amp;#39;s the mystery.  But  the fact remains, it has been proven time and again that patients  who  are given sugar pills or false serums and told that it will make  them  well not only become healthier, but even in tests where the  recipient is  &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; they are being given Placebo&amp;#39;s, they &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; feel better; simply for the fact of having been given a pill by men in white lab coats in a pristine environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth noting that I&amp;#39;m not talking purely about symptoms. These people don&amp;#39;t just &amp;#39;feel&amp;#39; better, they &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt;   better. To quote Erik Vance, Biologist and author of “Susceptible  You”,  a chronicle of his own studies on the Placebo Effect, there are   numerous cases of the Placebo Effect alone healing such illnesses as   Parkinson&amp;#39;s, Chronic Pain, IBS, Depression, Anxiety, certain types of   Asthma, and even Auto-Immune Deficiencies. Many medicines are just as   psychological as they are physical remedies, hence why the good doctor   always tells you this won&amp;#39;t hurt a bit, because it&amp;#39;s been proven time   and again that if he does not, it hurts far more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It   is even worth noting that the act of Visualizing in and of itself has   been studied with extreme scrutiny, to the point where it&amp;#39;s been   revealed that visualizing an action has the same effect on the brain as   physically performing an action (this is something many elite and   Olympian level athletes, including Emily Cook of the U.S Ski Team,   Lyndon Rush of the Canadian Bobsled Team, Al Oerter, four time Discus   champion, Billie Jean King, Tennis star, Lindsey Vonn of the U.S Alpine   Skiers, Manchester Football Players Wayne Rooney, Jonny Wilkinson and   Andy Murray. Former Olympian Swimmer for the U.S team Micheal Phelps,   Boxer Connor McGregor, and even Muhammad Ali all attest to the power of   visualization as well. They did it nigh constantly, visualizing their   training, their strokes, their moves, and their techniques when taking   breaks from physical training. Sports Psychologists who look after these   same Olympians recommend it themselves, including Dr.Micheal Gervais  of  the NFL, Nicole Detling, for the U.S team, and Britt Tajet-Foxell  for  the Norwegian team).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes -- the Placebo Effect actually healing people HAS interfered with hundreds of studies for new medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give this yet more basis in reality, the opposite is also true; colloquially known as the “Nocebo Effect”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some   time ago there was a study on something called “Hypersounds” -- noises   which are too loud to consciously pick up on, but when they press on   your inner ear, they cause rapid onset of headaches and migraines. The   thing is, they don&amp;#39;t exist... or rather, the symptoms from them does   not. Yet many who participated in the study found they actually   developed the symptoms mentioned. Just as Placebos were discovered   through drug-trials where those given fake pills actually had their   symptoms and sickness alleviated, Nocebos were discovered by people   suffering the nasty side effects that come with many medicines -- the   very medicines they didn&amp;#39;t take. Once more, it is worth noting this   wasn&amp;#39;t just psychological phenomena. Nocebo&amp;#39;s actually do hurt. They   have a very real, very physical effect on the body, including   inflammation, rashes, bruises, nausea, headaches, hosts of symptoms   associated with general sickness, depression, insomnia, difficulty   breathing, withdrawal, and even addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet   again one might scoff and try to disprove these studies by claiming   they are just cases of misattribution. Everyone can have a good (or off)   day, so when they have one whilst taking X drug (or fake drug), they   put blame on the drug. I will myself confirm that yes, this does happen,   but the Placebo Effect wouldn&amp;#39;t be so popular or so deeply studied if   it were ALL cases of misattribution. In fact, Placebo&amp;#39;s (and Nocebo&amp;#39;s)   are so effective that it is estimated that upwards of 70%+ of all   recovery or degradation occurs strictly because of said phenomena. This   is not to say that medicine is largely useless, mind; only that any   medicine at all will be hard pressed to heal you if you are absolutely   convinced you will remain as sick as a dog, and likewise any sickness   will be hard pressed to keep you down if you are absolutely convinced a   good night&amp;#39;s rest will make you chipper as a chipmunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To   make matters more confusing still, there are also “Placebo Blockers”.   If you are given a Placebo and told it will give you a rash, and then   secretly given real medicine which specifically reduces rashes, the   recipients had no or very minor rashes, compared to those who were not   given the Blockers. Likewise, if you were given medicine that actually   causes rashes as a side effect, and then given a placebo that mitigates   those symptoms, you would be in the same boat as the aforementioned,   having little to no symptoms despite their frequency in patients without   the Blockers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In   either, any, and all cases, the bottom line is that it is the raw   belief that matters. The greater the conviction, the greater the   real-world effect. It doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be just one person:   Mass-Hysteria, Mass-Psychogenic-Illness, Mass-Hypnosis, Mass-Psychosis,   and even that weird dancing plague that happened in Europe during the   14th-to-17th century are all related to Placebos, and all of them have   real, physical, bodily effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If seeing is believing, then here we can clearly deduce that the reverse is also true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which glides just perfectly into my next topic: Hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sufferers   of hallucinations will tell you outright that there is no fool-proof   way to tell when a hallucination is, in fact, a hallucination other than   the outlandishness of the situation, or how out of place the   hallucination might be. It is easy to know when you are hallucinating a   voice at 2 A.M when no one else is around, but there is no way to tell   when you are if you are walking through a crowded hall. It is easy to   know you are hallucinating an alien, but not so much if it is just a man   as like to any other. Indeed, those who have frequent or infrequent   hallucinations will tell you that they are not just sight and sound, but   can even be taste, smell, and touch. Hallucinations can, in fact, be   tactile, and you would be unable to tell which is which if you shook a   man&amp;#39;s hand, so indistinguishable it would be from the regular sensation   of a handshake. Keep in mind hallucinations do not always overlap; some   are only auditory, while others are purely olfactory; yet they always &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;   overlap, and it becomes extremely distressing when it does; especially   when you learn that hallucinations can actually cause you pain. From   feeling the sensation of creepy-crawlies climbing up your back, to   suddenly feeling as if you had been pinched or pricked with needles, or   even the extremely distressing scenario of hallucinating a full blown   attack or mugging, where you can actually feel as if you&amp;#39;ve been   stabbed, though it is admittedly rare (with only a rough 20% of   hallucinations being tactile). The symptoms are similar to that of Sleep   Paralysis, wherein many sufferers report that sensations caused by the   hallucinations have a real and lasting effect on the body even after   fully waking (such as the pain of a compressed chest, being unable to   breathe, whilst hallucinating that an extremely heavy thing is on top of   you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phantom   Limb Pain is a similar issue, the feeling of pain and discomfort in a   limb that has been previously amputated; note: You are not feeling the   pain of the amputation, you are feeling as if the limb that is no  longer  there is, itself, in pain; as if you lit a match over an open  area and  your brain interpreted it as being held under your arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet   again this seems far-fetched until I remind you, dear reader, that you   yourself have likely hallucinated similar things when you dream; for   nearly all of us have had a dream that was chock full of sensations of   sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch that we could only imagine, such as   how it feels to fly, or something so beautiful it made us slack jawed.   So small are the amount of times we actually realize we are dreaming;   how strange, is it not? That no matter how surreal or fantastic   something is in comparison to our normal reality; our brain treats it as   if we walked out the door onto Jupiter for our regular Tuesday jaunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always   keep this in mind: this, all of this you are experiencing right now,   none of it is purely a physical sensation. Even the pain we discussed is   a mental stimulation, not a physical one. It is your brain, not your   body, that tells you when you are hurt. Much like with dreams, I&amp;#39;m sure   you can recall experiences where a sudden sensation or shock causes you   acute pain for a moment before you realize you aren&amp;#39;t actually hurt  (as  it has me), or the opposite, where you feel no pain until you look  and  see a wound on your body that you cannot recall receiving, and  suddenly  it begins hurting (as it has me). Pain is a mental  stimulation, but it  doesn&amp;#39;t stop at the mere sensation of pain either;  cases of spontaneous  combustion, spontaneous wounds appearing on the  body, Stigmata (the  manifestation of religiously significant wounds on  the body), and even  the simple fact of an absurd amount of people going  online to talk about  wounds, whether scratches, bruises, fire, or even  acidic, appearing on  the body with no idea as to how they could have  gotten there, are all  recorded, yet under-researched and  under-examined. While it may be true  that a good portion of these cases  are faked, the mere fact that wounds  have shown up with no external  cause and seemingly no underlying medical  issue, simply because you  believe in it, is enough to raise a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But   this is all just conjecture, isn&amp;#39;t it? This is all just hypothesis,   metaphysical, none of it is actually proven. So, I suppose I will have   to give actual proof, won&amp;#39;t I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amou   Haji is a very interesting Iranian man. When interviewed about the way   he lived, he revealed that, as a young chap in his early 20&amp;#39;s, he   encountered some &amp;#39;emotional setbacks&amp;#39; which caused him to view the world   in an entirely different way than most, believing that being clean   causes sickness, and being dirty leads to health. Since then, he has   never showered, bathed, or cleaned himself in any way. He eats only   rotten meat (Entirely roadkill or the remains of any dead animal,   seemingly without any veggies at all), and drinks water only from his   rusted oil can. He&amp;#39;s a chain smoker, alternating between smoking animal   feces from his large clay pipe, or regular cigarettes, five at a time.   He sleeps in a simple hole in the ground on the outskirts of his town  (a  village called Dejgah in the southern province of Fars), reminiscent  of  a grave, and for the harsh Iranian winters, wears only a metal  helmet  on top of his usual, never changing, rags to keep himself warm.  As  mentioned, he does all of this because he believes being dirty is  what  leads to health, and while his idea seems first laughable and  borderline  lunatic, you may want to give him more credit, for he has  lived this  way for over 60 years. Indeed, at the time of this writing,  Mr. Haji is  84 years old. You could doubt his claims that he has lived  this way  since early adulthood, but looking at pictures of the bloke,  it&amp;#39;s easy  to see that if he&amp;#39;s telling a fib, he and his village are the  most  dedicated liars on the planet. Yes, his village too, for all of  them  corroborate his story and agree that he has lived this way longer  than  many of them have been alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, the average lifespan for a male in Iran is 72. 72.5 if you really want to be a stickler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?   What? How could this possibly be? People get sick of tetanus from a   splinter and die, and this man has been ingesting rotten, parasite   ridden food, rust from his cup, dirt in every orifice, blackening his   lungs from the constant smoking, never brushing his teeth, eating only   with his dirt caked hands, never so much as properly wiping his ass, and   he has never gotten sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has never gotten sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since   adopting this lifestyle, he has reported no sickness, nor has anyone  in  his village called him a liar. He has all his limbs, all his fingers   and toes, he is not blind, not hard of hearing, able to outrun the  grown  men who sometimes chase him to try to give him a bath, and is  seemingly  perfectly sound of mind (as sound of mind as most people  would regard a  man living in his condition, anyways), responding  reasonably and with  lucidity to any and all interviews given to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite   this disease-ridden lifestyle, he is untouched by it. Despite   everything our mothers tell us, our doctors tell us, our teachers tell   us, our biologists tell us, every single thing revolving around health,   nutrition, and wellness, he adheres to none of it, the exact opposite  of  all of it, and he has lived longer than most men and women in his   entire nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In   fact, he&amp;#39;s lived longer than most men the world over. As of 2015 the   highest life expectancy on Earth for men is in Switzerland at 81.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt he will live longer still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why.   Why is he able to live like this for so long, still so robust in his   health, you may ask. Why, dear reader, haven&amp;#39;t you been listening? It&amp;#39;s   because he &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; he is   healthy. He believes his lifestyle makes him the healthiest man alive,   and so he lives as stout as if he really were. His faith and conviction   are so strong in this regard that the Placebo Effect is unstoppable,   eradicating all sickness within him and keeping him in good shape,   greater than any average man of his age. Likewise, I have no doubt that   if he actually were forced to bathe, it truly would kill him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet   again, the skeptic would probably mumble something about him gaining  an  immunity from so many diseases through the harsh lifestyle with  which  he&amp;#39;s lived...but wouldn&amp;#39;t that prove my point anyways? That so  many have  died from sickness so little while he, such an old man, still  thrives  because he believes he will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are   you feeling like you&amp;#39;re tipping on the edge of a precipice by now?   Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;ll toss you right into the abyss myself, for here we   examine physics and the defects of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The   Double-Slit Experiment is a very famous, and relatively obscure,   example of just how strange the universe actually is. You should do   yourself a favour and delve into it on your own time, both for how   interesting it is and for the fact that you will learn far more, but to   save time I will give you the jist of it: Particles behave differently   when being observed vs. when they are left to their own devices. In the   early 20th century, an experiment was done firing particles out of a   canon to see how they interacted with the environment (specifically to   see whether they behaved as a wave, hitting all areas with lower and   higher intensity, respectively, or as solids, hitting some areas 100% of   the time while avoiding others 100% of the time. They did this by   setting up a wall with two slits in it and set it between the shooter   and the backboard). It behaved as a wave, and some folks were displeased   with this result, believing it was because the particles, all being   fired at once, were interfering with eachother&amp;#39;s course of direction by   bouncing off one another. They repeated the experiment, but this time   firing only one particle at a time, rather than in large bursts, and the   particles behaved...as a wave. No interference, through only two  slits,  it created a wave pattern, which would be similar to you  throwing a  tennis ball through one of two holes in the wall and seeing  the dent the  ball made off of the backboard as if it hit five separate  locations at  once, none of which in the direction you threw it in. The  physicists  concluded that the particles, being in super-position (that  is to say,  capable of doing multiple, seemingly contradicting things,  at the same  time), were actually bouncing off of themselves, thus  creating the  pattern. To see how they were doing this, the physicists  tried to  directly observe the experiment, only for the particles to  behave, well,  as particles. Throwing a ball through one of two holes  and seeing the  dent on the backboard in exactly the areas you threw it  in. The very act  of observing, measuring, trying to find out which one  it would go  through, collapsed the super-position, &amp;#39;forcing&amp;#39; the  particle to have to  choose which slit to go through. If this all sounds  very confusing,  that&amp;#39;s because it is. “Truth is stranger than fiction”  and all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To   better understand Super-Position, and the collapsing of it, I would   direct you to Shrodinger&amp;#39;s Cat: A philosophical experiment regarding   this very thing. The idea being that, if you put a cat in a box with a   vial of poison that MAY break in five minutes, and close the box, that   cat is now in super-position. It is fully capable of &amp;#39;being&amp;#39; either   alive or dead at the same time. The idea being, until you open the box   and see for certain, the possibility of the cat being either alive or   dead is equal; it is effectively both and neither. By opening the box,   you &amp;#39;collapse&amp;#39; the super-position, &amp;#39;forcing&amp;#39; the universe to choose   between whether the cat is objectively living or objectively dead.   Particles, because of their obeying the laws of quantum physics rather   than our regular type, are in a state of super-position that actually   ALLOWS them to do multiple, contradictory things at once; perhaps   equatable to hearing both the cat slump over dead and the cat tramp   around meowing, still alive. The particles behave as if there were   clones of it doing other things simultaneously, even though no such   clones exist. It is only when you observe the particles that they are   unable to do this, being only one, and thus behaving as if there were   only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This   is a very important thing to note, for despite having to do with   quantum physics, and thus obeying a set of universal rules we, as   giants, rarely have to worry about; it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt   that the act of participating in something, even if merely by watching   it, changes the way the universe, atoms, and our reality works. “You   cannot prove there isn&amp;#39;t a very quiet elephant just outside of your   field of vision at all times”. It proves that reality is malleable,   being able to be shaped and molded depending on how you see it, or even   if you see it, or where you are seeing it from. This is compounded on   top of issues previously touched upon, of hallucinations, dreams, and   even phantom sensations. It will be compounded further still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The   brain is imperfect, as everyone knows, but it is still more imperfect   than anyone knows. We trust our brains absolutely, only because we have   no choice, but whether in double-blind studies, tests, tricks, or  simple  party games and illusions we all so easily fall prey to, it is  shown  just how easily brains can err. Memories are nigh always wrong,  whether  rose tinted or altered in some way, hence why reports from  eyewitnesses  to crimes are so ineffective. Memories are not only wrong  but can even  be falsely implanted. People, whether due to increased  stress, peer  pressure, or repeated coaxing, can begin to form vivid  memories of  things that never happened so accurately that the same  synapses are  shown to fire off when thinking of them as they would when  recalling a  favourite childhood memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your   eyes are riddled with blind spots, whether it&amp;#39;s the dots you cannot  see  and your brain just automatically fills them in for you with what  it  believes ought to be there, or the fact that your eyes constantly  see  your nose and just phase it out. Hallucinations are easy to induce;  you  could do so by starring into a mirror in the dark with nothing but  a dim  candle flame and in about 10 minutes you will see all kinds of  odd and  silly things floating right behind you. The most glaring fault  is the  fact that everything you see is actually upside-down. Light from  above  you hits the bottom of your retina, and light from below you  hits the  top, meaning that everything below you would be seen as above  you and  everything above you would be seen as below you, but your brain  just  corrects it for you. We&amp;#39;ve already discussed the Placebo Effect  and  Hallucinations, and the implications it has on how your brain  interprets  the world around you, as well as the universe itself, which  depends  upon observation from this faulty brain to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I   tell you all this in order to prove that nothing is so concrete or  real  as we imagine it to be. Indeed, it is purely out of convenience  and  because we need SOME foundation to stand on that we treat the laws  of  the universe as we do, rather than as the mere suggestion that they   truly are, so often breaking down and changing when you grow too big or   too small, or get too close to a black hole; when you dream, your  brain  treats it as an alternate reality, but we also rely upon it to  tell us  what reality is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing   all this, I have a question to ask you. Knowing that needing to  believe  in something for it to work is a commonly accepted practice,  knowing  how many put such faith into the Law of Attraction, knowing the  Placebo  Effect causes real, measurable changes in the physical body,  knowing  that visualization has the same effect on your body as the  imagined  activity does, knowing that imagined hallucinations can  trigger the  exact same sensations as true-to-life stimuli, knowing that  the  interpretation of our reality is a mental process, and how faulty  our  mental processes truly are, on top of how faulty our reality truly  is,  knowing absolutely, with unshakable proof, that a firm conviction  is  enough to seemingly disregard commonly held laws of biology,  physics,  and nature, knowing all of this, I ask you one question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If   I believed I held a fireball in my hands, to hear its crackling and   believe in it as I believe in the air I breathe, and you believed I held   a fireball in my hands, feeling the heat come off it as if it would   blister your skin and feeling the pain of its light searing your   retinas, and I lobbed it at you, what do you think would happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This   is magic, true magic, and the basis of all spell-work to follow. More   than being real as it is, with what we just discussed, it does not even  &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;  to be &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; to have any  true to life effect. As a matter of fact, I  think at this point, it&amp;#39;s  rather ridiculous judging something by how  &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; it is at all, don&amp;#39;t  you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old mystics wrote that with faith, one could move mountains. I don&amp;#39;t know if they realized how correct they truly were.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"02/02/2020 was the last night I laid down and got a good nights rest. For the past 20 days some kind of spiritual entity has been performing brain surgery on me. You can refer to my last post to see what I originally wrote about it when it began. 

And before anyone starts I agree sleep is highly important, but this thing is rejuvenating me overnight. It does something to my nose to breathe like you do when you're sleeping. Once or twice I even snored. I feel completely refreshed throughout the day.

I still can't communicate with it. Idk if its inter dimensional or extra terrestrial. Angel or Alien.Last week it had me open my eyes for half hr or so. When I tried to look in its direction the background of it would wave similar to if you were looking through heat. I tried to record it, but nothing showed up on tape. I suppose capturing moments of an entity operating outside my version of space / time is a little difficult lol.

It feels like brain surgery, but instead of pain its pleasure. The rare occasions there is pain its very mild. Usually a quick pinch. If I'm ever thinking negatively about anything in life, it always sends love vibrations or good feelings in general.

It comes to me anytime I start meditating. Usually within 5 minutes. It likes to play jokes. Usually when it arrives it pushes my head to the side and down really fast. A few times when I had spotify on it would start twitching my shoulders to the beat. I'll usually wait until it gives me some kind of okay to take a break. I kept thinking about food one day, and its signal was blocking my airway for a moment. I made a choking sound the burst out laughing. I imagined it calling me a fatass or something. 

It has a selection of surgery tools it uses. Most of the time its hovering around and using two small tentacle like arms poking different parts. It also uses a small chain saw type tool, a small Jack hammer type, heavy vibration wand, and a small hammer. It's only used hammer twice. It hits the top of the back half. Like a doctor would to your knee. Up and down then it moves to the right some and does the same until it reaches the opposite side. The first time it did this an electric shock would occur in a few spots it hit. Last night it filled the middle right side of my forehead with some type of liquid. I could it feel it pulsing the veins in the sides of my head as it was absorbed. Then it sprayed some down the top of my nasal cavity. It dropped down to the back of my mouth. It didn't taste like anything. 

I feel fucking awesome. Better than I ever haven. I'm not in mania. I operate fine throughout the day. I'm a delivery driver, and I'm dropping packages off 40 hours a week. If I'm not working or running errands then I'm meditating. If my son interrupts me I'll tend to him and get right back to it. I moved in with my mom after my incident last year. I told her what's going on with me last week. She put me in the hospital last year, but she's being supportive. She's worried about my sleep, but trusting since I'm acting normal. 

I got brain damage from taking psych meds for only a few months. This entity has healed the damage and then some. Even as I'm typing this it's hard at work. It pushed and held my eyes closed twice while typing this up. Last year a doctor diagnosed me with bipolar type one because I was in ""mania"". I believed him for a while, but they were dead wrong.

,Thetruthishere,"Let me start by saying I'm pretty much a skeptic when it comes to this sort of stuff. I enjoy reading the stories posted here, but honestly don't believe the majority of them. That skepticism applies to my own encounter as well. Anyway, I've decided to go ahead and post this story here, and I'll let you all make of it what you will.

When I was in highschool, I played trumpet in our school's marching band. We often travelled around the state (Missouri) to compete in competitions. So my Senior year, which was in 2013, we were playing at a competition held in Columbia, MO, at Mizzou University. Our school had made into the finals, but we were going to be the last band to perform. This meant by the time we were warming up to go on, it was nearly 10:00 PM. Our band had a tradition of praying before every show. For those of us that aren't religious, we were allowed to sit out the prayer, and just be respectfully quiet. My friend (I'll just refer to him as ""Matt"". Not his real name obviously) and I were two of those who always sat it out. While everyone was praying, suddenly Matt tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed up into the sky. It was a clear...I want to say early November night, but I'm not completely certain on that. Anyway, when I looked up, I saw what he was pointing at. It was a set of three, very dull, sort of blurry lights, in a fixed triangle formation. It flew over us quietly, making no noise. As I watched it move in a, I believe South Western direction, I could actually make out a black silhouette itself in the shape of a triangle, the dull lights positioned at each corner. The lights never flashed, just stayed the same dull brightness, and kinda grayish color. After about 30 seconds, it was out of sight, since we didn't catch it until it was directly over head. Of course me and Matt definitely made it a talking point on the bus ride home. At the time I thought it was *weird*, but didn't think much of it. Fast forward to July of 2013. Matt and I had graduated in May, and were wanting to hang out before starting college in August. We decided to go camping at Table Rock Lake, which is a man-made lake, in southwestern Missouri, near the Arkansas border. I think in total there were four people. Myself, Matt and his gf, and another friend of ours. It was the second night of camping, and we decided to go for a swim at around 2 am. We didn't go out far, mostly just stayed near the shore. About an hour goes by, and I'm looking at the sky. It was a very clear night, and the light pollution was a lot less out here than in the city that we lived in, so the stars were beautiful. Suddenly, I see it again. The same object I had seen months prior in Columbia. For reference, Columbia is over 200 miles from where we were at. Again, it had the same three, dull lights, in a triangle formation, still just as silent. I pointed it out, and our group watched it as it flew over. Not sure of the direction this time though. As soon as it was overhead though, the waves in the lake picked up. The wake was as if a large boat was speeding past, but of course, there were no boats. At least not that we could see.

,Thetruthishere,"My grandad was diagnosed with Parkinson's and then Alzheimer's approximately four years prior to his passing at 78 years old. For the year prior, he lost his ability to walk, use his arms and talk, acknowledge those around him and respond to his environment. Basically his soul was trapped inside his body, watching us all but unable to speak to us. 

My nan became his sole carer, they set up a harness system in the home to move him from room to room for showering/toilet, bed and lounge room time. She would bathe him, feed him and anything else he needed. She vowed to be by his side until he died. They shared a bed their entire life and that never changed even when he was sick.

One night, prior to his passing something eery happened. My nan was doing her usual routine of reading a newpaper to my grandad (as it was his favorite thing when he was able to read). Out of nowhere my nan was overcome with an eery feeling. She wasn't sure what this was.
A few minutes later my grandad spoke... he turned his head, looked at her and said ""I love you Shirley"". 
In disbelief my nan said ""ken? Ken? What did you say?"". That was all. He then stopped eating, refused food and died within a week in his favorite arm chair.

For the year prior, he lost his ability to walk, use his arms and talk, acknowledge those around him and respond to his environment. Basically his soul was trapped inside his body, watching us all but unable to speak to us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My nan became his sole carer, they set up a harness system in the home to move him from room to room for showering/toilet, bed and lounge room time. She would bathe him, feed him and anything else he needed. She vowed to be by his side until he died. They shared a bed their entire life and that never changed even when he was sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, prior to his passing something eery happened. My nan was doing her usual routine of reading a newpaper to my grandad (as it was his favorite thing when he was able to read). Out of nowhere my nan was overcome with an eery feeling. She wasn&amp;#39;t sure what this was.
A few minutes later my grandad spoke... he turned his head, looked at her and said &amp;quot;I love you Shirley&amp;quot;. 
In disbelief my nan said &amp;quot;ken? Ken? What did you say?&amp;quot;. That was all. He then stopped eating, refused food and died within a week in his favorite arm chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He never visiaully recognized anyone during his last year, so for him to look at nan and also speak was a miracle. I believe his internal spirit was able to over power the disease to communicate one last time before passing and becoming free.

,Thetruthishere,"This happened to a friend of mine, so it's not my own story. Wanted to share because of it's strangeness.

This story happened to me about 12 years ago. I was around 24 at the time. I worked hospitality so it’d be later at night when my friends and I hung out. So, at around 9 o’clock my friend and I decided to go for a drive, someplace we’ve never been, just get in the car and go. I offered (and wanted to) drive because my mother was out of town and I was using her Mercedes. It was one of those early 90’s E bodies, the ones that were big piles of heavy steal, a real tank of a car. I only mention the car body because it becomes relevant later in the story. He happily agreed and we hit the road. 

We lived near Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the time. Good ole Wisconsin where you get a lot of really good stories out of I’ve noticed, it seems to be a pretty paranormal state. Either way, we drive north out of the city and drive for about an hour when I see an exit I don’t recognize and decide to get off there. There was nothing at this exit other than corn fields, no gas station or restaurant signs, no visible light of a town in any direction. So we are in a place we don’t recognize but that was the point, just driving to get nowhere because the speed limit was 35  and we were in no rush. The moon was out enough that everything was pretty visible. About a mile into the cornfields, we could see 2 kids on the right side of the road. We comment on how weird it is because there is no housing or stores or even lights on a horizon, plus it was 10:30ish at night. Naturally were two larger guys so we don’t worry about anything so I slow down so we can inquire if their car broke down or if they were ok. 

As we pulled up, I noticed the kid in fronts clothing. It was a stained cream colored tweed type shirt with real tattered sleeves and overalls with only one strap. He appeared to be maybe 12-years old. The second kid was taller wearing a red flannel type shirt, with old times looking khaki pants. However, I could barely notice the taller kid standing further behind the smaller one because as I pulled up noticing the clothes, I got to see the whole “child” fully and his arms were to his side slightly raised, almost in that iconic zombie way. But his eyes, I couldn’t take my eyes off of his, and I did my best to mutter to my friend “you’re seeing this too right?”. His eyes were pitch black, blacker than the night, but easy to see as he stood there staring at us. I did not know what the heck I was seeing but I’ve never been so frightened in my life and I’ve had several odd experiences that have left me unable to deny that there is more in this world than what we understand. So we’re stopped for a moment locking eyes with whatever this thing was, it was no child, it was evil, I have zero doubts of that. We quickly agree to go, and fast. We are not going to inquire with them, this was straight out of twilight zone, and I remembered the hitchhiker and that was not happening tonight no sir. So, we go and we clamor between ourselves “what the $#@&amp; did we just see, what was that what the hell was that!”. Still no signs of homes, just open corn fields. How these 2 kids could be there, I don’t know but I believe those were not kids. 

So I keep driving, and we get out of the fields into a wooded windy road shortly after probably around 5 minutes. Here in Wisconsin there are random historical markers displaying in whatever year this happened information. I only mention that because I passed one on the curve so I glanced at that, As I’m driving through a curve going about 45mph a creature walks in front of my car (my moms car)… As I saw it, it was nothing like I ever saw, it’s spine was tall, it stuck above the hood ornament as I hit it. It was a grey color and looked like nothing I’ve ever seen. It had a very tall arch in its spine, almost like when a cat hisses and goes on its toes, that kind of shape but in a very tall gangly creature. I hit this thing straight on with the tank of a Benz. My friend is freaked out at this point as am I to say the least. I stop immediately, but now we’re both a bit scared from the children of the corn, and now this thing literally within minutes of one another. We decide getting out is not going to happen, but I decide to stay in the locked car but use the car and it’s lights to see what we hit and make sure of whatever the hell it was is dead and I needed to know what I just saw. I drive in tiny circles backing up and forwards looking for this creature but after checking every inch within 100 yards and not seeing a thing including not a drop of blood where I hit it, straight on with a Benz, making contact with its spine, body, and head anywhere. That was unnerving and although I wanted to check my mothers car, that would be dealt with further down the road. We were not going to get out there. So we decided to head home at this point. 

15 minutes later before I got back to the freeway and I needed to get out and see how bad the car was. As I got out to check, quickly as I was not taking chances tonight, I noticed my grill was busted in but nothing too bad. So I made sure it was secure and got back in as quickly as possible, my friend decided to stay inside the car. Recently, I heard of the black eyed kids and freaked out a little bit. I did not know that they were a real thing, I thought I just saw a couple demon kids or damned ghosts or I didn’t know what to think. To this day, I’ve looked through tons of photos of supposed cryptid beasts and mythological creatures looking for what I hit, and the closest I’ve found is some Algonquin drawings of Wendigos and they were very close to what I believe I saw and hit that night. It seems to me very odd both things could happen so close to one another to not be related.

Possibly it was an evil area, or possibly a Ley line, I don’t know. 

I would like to point out I’ve lived in Wisconsin a long time and it was not a deer or a coyote or anything else. What I hit, was nothing native to the known Wisconsin landscape, and neither were those horrid kids.

,Thetruthishere,"My boyfriend passed away at the age of 26 after a 10 month long cancer battle on Jan 15th, 2020. Since his passing, his mom has been doing her best to get all of his affairs such as his bank account, subscriptions, and reoccurring payments like his car settled out.

Her and I were at their home alone. I was hanging out in his bedroom, packing my stuff to prepare for moving out after living there while he was going through his illness. She wanted to deactivate his Spotify account so it wasn't taking his money every month anymore. She later found out that if you close someone's Spotify account, it will erase all of their music and the playlists they made. We didn't want his stuff to get deleted because he made special playlists for me during our relationship, and when his family and I listen to the music he loved, it makes us feel closer to him. So she decided she will just put her credit card info onto his account so that it will just remain as it is.

She came in to ask for help because she was unfamiliar with how to use his iPhone. She wasn't able to find a way to change the payment info through the app, so I told her that she could most likely do it online. A few minutes later she came back in to his room to ask me about his log in information for his account. She said that [Spotify](https://Spotify.com)'s website kept saying that his email that she was trying to use to login didn't exist in their system. My boyfriend was always super organized too, and would always put his login info for all of his different accounts on a spreadsheet in his notes on his phone. But for some reason the only one that wasn't there was his Spotify account.

Neither of us really knew how to access his account at this point, we just guessed he had used an old email address that he didn't use anymore when he made his Spotify. She started looking on online forums to figure out how to solve this and I just continued packing.

Then she came back in and said ""Ok this is super weird!"" and she had a super wide-eyed expression. And I asked what happened, and she then told me to follow her into her bedroom where her computer was. She told me that after she was done reading the forums, she was advised to go onto Spotify's website and try using the 'I forgot my email or password' tool. So she typed ""[spotify.com](https://spotify.com)"" in the search bar and once the page was opened, his account was already logged in! Mind you that this specific computer that she was using was a super old desktop that my boyfriend had never used, at least not within the passed few years. Not only that but, she was on Spotify's login page minutes before she reopened it and he wasn't logged in before. And also, even if he did use that computer to login to his account at some point in the past, there's no way it would have stayed logged in for that long, it would have been done at least a year before this day.

She then went ahead and changed the credit card info. And just to test our theory, once she did that she closed the page without logging out, and then restarted the browser and went back on to Spotify and lo and behold, he was now logged out.

His mom and I couldn't stop smiling while also feeling overwhelmed with how crazy this was. We truly believe he was helping her. I told her that he must feel pretty good about our decision to keep his music and playlists around, and that he wanted to help her out cause she always had a hard time figuring out how to use technology.

,Thetruthishere,"I grew up in the states, I was raised here but my parents have different ethnic backgrounds. My mom has a Tunisian background, which is a country in North Africa. Every summer vacation, my mom and my two brothers would go to Tunisia because she wants to go see family there. My dad stays in the states to work and take care of things while we are gone. Anyways, after a couple of summer vacations, I learned the country. Their traditions, the roads, stores, how to act, how traffic works, how to cross streets with no stoplights, etc. so I know the country pretty well. My first experience was around 4 years ago when I was maybe 11-12, I don’t exactly remember but I’m 15 now and 4 years ago must have been around that age range. I’ve never had ANY experiences in the US and only in Tunisia. My mom had a house that we would go to every summer, it had a master bedroom where she and my two younger brothers slept. I slept in the living room because the extra rooms had way too much stuff in them. The house was pretty small, it was a one story with the living room pretty much facing the rooms, you can see all three rooms clearly from the living room. All three doors were closed, my mom and brothers were already long asleep and I was drifting off when I heard a door open. The doors were fully wooden and they creaked very loud when opened, so I looked up and all the rooms were still closed. No open doors, nothing. Hm, weird. I thought I was probably just imagining things because I’m so tired so I lay down, and again, the creaking door sound, this time it was clear and loud. This time I stand up, yet again no doors are open. I go to the bathroom and washed my face to wrap my head around what was going on, I was pretty young so I didn’t know how to react. Once I left the bathroom, heading back to the living room, my room door was wide open. It freaked me out, I closed the door and was scared to ever go in that room after that. I think I might have told my mom but I don’t remember. Nothing happened after that night, the next year, I went over to my grandmothers house, her house was bigger and more modern because she actually lived here. I went to spend the night, I was in the extra room on my phone at around 2 am when I heard some weird sound that sounded like it came from the wall, it kinda sounded like an insect but a very weird version and it got louder and louder. It wouldn’t stop so I woke my grandma and she heard it too but said it was probably some kinda cricket in there. It didn’t sound like a cricket though it was a very weird sound , it went on all night but the next morning it was gone. I recorded it a long time ago but it was on my old phone and it is deleted, I'll tell you this though, it definitely was not an insect. Again, for the rest of the vacation, nothing happened. The third year, I was having a sleepover with a couple of friends. There is a room at the back of the house, pretty far from the living room. This room was an extra room and has a backdoor to the outside of the house leading to the backyard. Anyways, they didn't have a netflix account in Tunisia so I had to login with my account. We all sat down with blankets and were chilling but once we started watching a movie thats when I realized that I forgot my glasses in that extra room. When I got up and went to the room, the room door was wide open and the lights were open. and I am 110% sure that I locked the room door and closed the lights because they had a german shepherd that we didn't want in that room. I was the last one out that room earlier and I promise you I locked it and closed the lights. It was none of my friends because I was the only one who left the living room and they didn't have the keys to the door. It also could not be anyone else from the outside because the backdoor that I mentioned earlier was also locked and barricaded so no one can enter from outside. To this day, I have no explanation to what that was about. The fourth and final one (Last summer) happened when I was home alone and my parents were at a wedding ceremony. We had no AC and it was very hot so I opened some windows up. I decided to play on my phone since I just jailbroke it and was trying out the new features and watching YouTube. Suddenly, I hear faint screams coming From outside the open window, it sounded like the type of screams from a rollercoaster but the closest amusement park is about 120 miles away. It was young girls and guys screaming but it was faint. Faint, but clear. The direction it came from was nothing but sand and trees and nothing for miles and miles upon end. I was on my phone so I recorded it, and you can hear it so it wasn’t part of my imagination.

,Thetruthishere,"Hello Reddit, I think my house (specifically my brothers room) is haunted. Before I start let me say sorry if my English is bad if from Serbia and it’s my second language and if my formatting is bad I’m on my phone.
First let me explain the layout of my house ,there is no fence because wall of the house is on the street (if that is how you say it) so you could knock on windows from street ,as you enter our house , in front of you is a big mirror in a hallway left of the mirror is my brothers room ,left to you is mine and on the right is “main room/living room” with a kitchen and through glass door you can enter our backyard with a garage and a little place with a bbq.

Now that we got that out of the way we can start .
This story will be in 3 parts :
The feeling
The dreams
The bird
I think this will be a long one so yea tnx if you read it.

The feeling 

My family and I moved into this house in early 2015 and ever since then my brother and I have this feeling of being watched,but that’s not all of it ,
Every time I’m going to my room , as I walk through the hallway I have a feeling that something/someone is behind me and if I don’t hurry up it will catch me and kill me and I’m too afraid to look back ( I’m a 18 yo m that is not easily scared). and there is this sence of fear every time I’m about to turn the lights on in the living room. 
But I use to put this all aside because I used to think i was paranoid because of the new house but 5 years passed and the feelings didn’t go away or anything.

The dreams

I will begin this part by saying that my brother is a sleep walker ever since we were kids so I’m used to that staff but his dreams (and some of mine) are the thing that’s making me feel in safe In my house. 
He said that he has dreams about animals and animal like creatures usually trying to hurt him or covered in blood. 
One that scared me the most is the one that I witnessed. He said that in his dream a head of a boar was above him with blood all over him and that he woke up and jumped from his bed all across his room (I saw all this because I was in his room on his laptop doing homework). I was shook and asked him what happened and he told me and said that ever since we moved in he has that type of dreams so he’s used to it. But now let us talk about one that scared my for life and the main reason I can’t look through the glass door in my living room.
I’ve dreamed of a lady in red with blond hair I looked at her trough that glass door she just stood there in the low mist until she noticed me.
She turned into this devilish creature and started to run at me I ran back to my room jumped in bed and coverd myself with my blanket that I had since I was 3 yo. 
Then the feeling stoped and I guess I woke up in a sitting position coverd and was to afraid to uncover my head to see if she is there bukv I did it , I peaked and she wasn’t there. 
After that I had dreams where she would just stand in my dreams , normal dreams but she would be in everyone just standing and watching me . I thought nothing of it until my brother told me had a nightmare about a evil lady in red... that shit scared me and made me almost cry. 
Now I see her only from time to time in my dreams. 

And now finally 

The bird

This is a sad and a short story about how one of my pet birds died.
We had 3 parrots as pets 1 cockatail and 2 budgies that are in my brothers room.
One night my brother stayed up late and I had already been in my bed half asleep when all of sudden my brother comes into my room and tells me to come and look at one of the budgies. Because of the fear in his eyes I did and what I saw scared me,the little bird had been hanging from the top of the cage paralyses blinking and breading but completely paralyzed we took him from the cage and looked on the internet for what can cause bird-paralysis and main factor is fear so I asked my brother what happened and he told me that he felt like he is being watched and at that moment all 3 of birds started screaming and flying in the cage and hitting walls of that same cage .
He jumped out of the bed and turned the light on uncovered the cage and saw the same thing I did. 
I did some research and I read that birds can feel danger and then they panic and start screaming. 
This happened about a month ago and since then I feel even more scared in my house.

And yea few times I saw a black figure in my room and woke up with a scratch on my arm not a big one just a small one so I didn’t think much of it but it might mean something.

Well that is all of it I don’t know if this fits here but I’m looking for some kind of explanation about all this and if you read the whole thing tnx you.

Help?,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,16,0,False,t3_f7bik1,False,dark,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Haunted Building,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1582322623.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit, I think my house (specifically my brothers room) is haunted. Before I start let me say sorry if my English is bad if from Serbia and it’s my second language and if my formatting is bad I’m on my phone.
First let me explain the layout of my house ,there is no fence because wall of the house is on the street (if that is how you say it) so you could knock on windows from street ,as you enter our house , in front of you is a big mirror in a hallway left of the mirror is my brothers room ,left to you is mine and on the right is “main room/living room” with a kitchen and through glass door you can enter our backyard with a garage and a little place with a bbq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we got that out of the way we can start .
This story will be in 3 parts :
The feeling
The dreams
The bird
I think this will be a long one so yea tnx if you read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family and I moved into this house in early 2015 and ever since then my brother and I have this feeling of being watched,but that’s not all of it ,
Every time I’m going to my room , as I walk through the hallway I have a feeling that something/someone is behind me and if I don’t hurry up it will catch me and kill me and I’m too afraid to look back ( I’m a 18 yo m that is not easily scared). and there is this sence of fear every time I’m about to turn the lights on in the living room. 
But I use to put this all aside because I used to think i was paranoid because of the new house but 5 years passed and the feelings didn’t go away or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dreams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will begin this part by saying that my brother is a sleep walker ever since we were kids so I’m used to that staff but his dreams (and some of mine) are the thing that’s making me feel in safe In my house. 
He said that he has dreams about animals and animal like creatures usually trying to hurt him or covered in blood. 
One that scared me the most is the one that I witnessed. He said that in his dream a head of a boar was above him with blood all over him and that he woke up and jumped from his bed all across his room (I saw all this because I was in his room on his laptop doing homework). I was shook and asked him what happened and he told me and said that ever since we moved in he has that type of dreams so he’s used to it. But now let us talk about one that scared my for life and the main reason I can’t look through the glass door in my living room.
I’ve dreamed of a lady in red with blond hair I looked at her trough that glass door she just stood there in the low mist until she noticed me.
She turned into this devilish creature and started to run at me I ran back to my room jumped in bed and coverd myself with my blanket that I had since I was 3 yo. 
Then the feeling stoped and I guess I woke up in a sitting position coverd and was to afraid to uncover my head to see if she is there bukv I did it , I peaked and she wasn’t there. 
After that I had dreams where she would just stand in my dreams , normal dreams but she would be in everyone just standing and watching me . I thought nothing of it until my brother told me had a nightmare about a evil lady in red... that shit scared me and made me almost cry. 
Now I see her only from time to time in my dreams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now finally &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bird&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sad and a short story about how one of my pet birds died.
We had 3 parrots as pets 1 cockatail and 2 budgies that are in my brothers room.
One night my brother stayed up late and I had already been in my bed half asleep when all of sudden my brother comes into my room and tells me to come and look at one of the budgies. Because of the fear in his eyes I did and what I saw scared me,the little bird had been hanging from the top of the cage paralyses blinking and breading but completely paralyzed we took him from the cage and looked on the internet for what can cause bird-paralysis and main factor is fear so I asked my brother what happened and he told me that he felt like he is being watched and at that moment all 3 of birds started screaming and flying in the cage and hitting walls of that same cage .
He jumped out of the bed and turned the light on uncovered the cage and saw the same thing I did. 
I did some research and I read that birds can feel danger and then they panic and start screaming. 
This happened about a month ago and since then I feel even more scared in my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yea few times I saw a black figure in my room and woke up with a scratch on my arm not a big one just a small one so I didn’t think much of it but it might mean something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that is all of it I don’t know if this fits here but I’m looking for some kind of explanation about all this and if you read the whole thing tnx you.
Love y’all and be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"So from what I was told by my Mom, this started to happen about a year and half, maybe 2 years ago. My Mom can smell death. I know it may sound weird but every single time she mentions the intense smell, someone dies within that same week.

Over the years, the sense of smell has gotten stronger and impossible to ignore. My Mom believes in God, prays and is an overall great human being. I swear to you, no matter what, when she smells death — it happens. It’s usually distant relatives, semi-close friends or her patients.

,Thetruthishere,"I am writing this post because I was told my story suits well in here. Sorry for my English, I am Italian and English is not my first language.
Everything that I’m telling you now happened a couple of summers ago, I was 17 and I used to ride my bike anytime I needed to go somewhere because I did not have a driving license. At the time I was always scared, I used to carry a swiss knife because I never felt safe during those years, like something was going to happen, maybe too many movies who knows lol.

One day, around 11 pm I was hanging out with a friend (a guy I know since elementary school), I am into photography so I was always carrying my camera and lenses, that day I shot some pictures as usual and then when it was getting late me and my friend split up, he went to his home and I was headed to mine. The distance between our houses is less than a km. 

I was riding my bike when a car came behind me, that’s kinda normal, when it happens I lower my speed and get to the side of the road and wait till they overtake me, but this time something is wrong, this guy is driving like a maniac revving and using high beams and it seems like he’s trying to scare me and run me over, I immediately try to protect my self and I decided to outrun him, so I start to ride as fast as I could, the guy was driving a white old bmw 5 series, a car I have never seen in my neighborhood.

I was so hyped and I decided to take a sharp turn right into a wrong way street, I thought that going back to my house wasn’t the best idea because he would have found out where I lived, I also had my expensive gear so I really wanted to run.

Here comes the strange part, I was so scared and full of adrenaline that I continued riding my bike for almost 4/5 blocks and I quickly reached my city centre square, the guy in the white car couldn’t take the wrong way street and he lost me. It was a summer night and people were enjoying the night, some guys where sitting in a bench and a bar was open. As I got to the city square I stopped, I was exhausted, almost everybody looked at me probably thinking “wtf is wrong with that guy”.
Like immediately a girl came at me from the bar, she was a waitress and she asked me if I was ok, she clearly asked me who he was (the guy that tried to run me over) and it was like we knew each other from school or something, she was familiar. I was shocked and I said that I didn’t know who he was, she took me to the bar and she gave me some water. Then I got out of the bar, took my bike and I immediately came back home (because I was really scared and all I wanted was to be at home). As I was riding I realized that what has just happened was pure illogical, she immediately helped me as soon as I got the bar and it was like she knew I was coming there, she knew about the crazy guy in the white car and she looked like someone I knew. I continued riding back home thinking about what happened and I felt really alive that night, I was riding my bike so fast and I felt relieved. When I got home I wasn’t scare anymore and I didn’t feel unsafe anymore. I didn’t speak to my parents because they were sleeping so I got to bed and I slept well all night.

The next day I was happy, but I found out my swiss knife was gone, I know for sure that I had it with me the night before, I asked my parents and my sister but they didn’t take it. It was vanished. I never told anybody neither my friend who is really skeptical when it comes to stuff like this, I also consider myself a skeptical, but still I haven’t found answers to my story.

I never found out what happened, never saw the girl again, neither that white car.

,Thetruthishere,"I had posted this originally in another paranormal sub, but I didn't like my original title...

This happened a few years ago when. My mom was renting a very large 4 bedroom house in the country and everyone who saw it was really amazed that she was only paying $800 a month. It had a huge living room, a den, a massive kitchen and each of the four bedrooms were abnormally large. On top of that, it had an eight acre field and a little guest house.

I was going to college at the time and I'd just come over to visit my mom and play with my three younger siblings. The first weird occurrence happened when I was playing tag with the kids in the field outside. It was getting dark and all of the sudden we heard some loud chanting. No one was around, but the chanting got louder.

Suddenly we heard the thundering of hooves headed our way. We ran back towards the house thinking stampeding horses were going to crush us. When we turned back, there was nothing. A week later I was at the house and I noticed my little sister playing in the corner and laughing. She started talking to someone who clearly was not there.

I asked her who she was talking to and she said ""My friend Keifer. He's dead."" The moment those words escaped her mouth, my mom's bookshelf collapsed, knocking every book to the floor. A few days later, my mom called me. She was frantic and upset.

My sister claimed that during the night someone was trying to grab her through the bathroom window. I drove over and helped look around the property for anyone hiding. I spoke to my sister and asked her to show me where she saw the person. She said ""It wasn't a person, it was a white angel face and it came from there!"" She pointed to the reflection of the window in the bathroom mirror.

A week later things got worse. I went over to the house when no one was home to use the computer. The second I walked through the door, the radio turned on and ""Eminence Front"" by the Who was playing...right at the ""Welcome to the party dressed to kill."" Part. I felt queasy, but I needed to work on my finals, so I shut off the radio and went to the computer.

About twenty minutes later, I heard the bathroom door slam and the toilet flushed three times. I went into the hallway and made sure all the doors were closed and ignored the whole thing. A few minutes later it happened again. The bathroom door opened and closed and the toilet flushed three times. I searched the whole house at this point. I was alone.

I was shaking, but I was a young, dumb twenty something and wouldn't take a hint. I kept working on the computer and tried to ignore what happened. The door slammed again and the toilet flushed three times once more. I got up and closed the door and yelled ""Fuck you! You can't scare me, you piece of shit!"" Big mistake.

I went into the living room and I heard all of the doors slam and then I heard heavy, soggy footsteps coming through the kitchen right toward the living room. I ran out the front door and ran around the house to where my car was parked. I looked up at the kitchen window and I saw the silhouette of a very tall figure standing in the kitchen window. It was solid black, like a shadow.

I got the hell out of there. Later in the day, my mom called me, pissed off that I tracked muddy bootprints all over the kitchen floor. I told her what happened and she freaked out. She saw bootprints before, but blamed my step dad.

The last incident was the scariest of all. A bunch of meth heads rented the little guest house on the property and my mom thought that they were going to break in so she set up a video camera that pointed from the living room to the backdoor in the kitchen. She later called me telling me that she wanted me to see the tape. We were both in the den watching the video of the kitchen. The bathroom door in the hallway can me heard creaking open and soggy footsteps can be heard loudly. The tape turns staticy and when it clears up, a tall shadow like outline of a person can be seen walking past the kitchen table. I noticed it had no visible legs. The figure tilts its head and turns toward the camera and the whole image turns to static. My mom and I both yell out in disbelief and then a loud, guttural laugh comes from the hallway.

A month later, my mom and step dad decide they've had enough and they are moving. On the day of the move, I saw the landlord and I asked him about the house. He said that it was once a care facility for children with special needs. Each room used to be divided in half so it actually had eight small rooms instead of four big ones.

One day a caretaker was bathing a child in the bathroom when the kid had a seizure. The caretaker panicked and ran for help, when he returned, he discovered the child had drowned. He was fired. Feeling guilty, the caretaker snuck into the house and slashed his wrists in the very same bathtub. He was found in the water with his boots on. I don't know the validity of the landlord's story, but it explains everything we experienced in that freaky house.

NOTE: This was in 2004, and my mom had moved about  three times after all of this occurred. She does not have the video anymore.  I wish we did, because it is a crazy story and some people will just not believe it.

&lt;p&gt;I was shaking, but I was a young, dumb twenty something and wouldn&amp;#39;t take a hint. I kept working on the computer and tried to ignore what happened. The door slammed again and the toilet flushed three times once more. I got up and closed the door and yelled &amp;quot;Fuck you! You can&amp;#39;t scare me, you piece of shit!&amp;quot; Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into the living room and I heard all of the doors slam and then I heard heavy, soggy footsteps coming through the kitchen right toward the living room. I ran out the front door and ran around the house to where my car was parked. I looked up at the kitchen window and I saw the silhouette of a very tall figure standing in the kitchen window. It was solid black, like a shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the hell out of there. Later in the day, my mom called me, pissed off that I tracked muddy bootprints all over the kitchen floor. I told her what happened and she freaked out. She saw bootprints before, but blamed my step dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last incident was the scariest of all. A bunch of meth heads rented the little guest house on the property and my mom thought that they were going to break in so she set up a video camera that pointed from the living room to the backdoor in the kitchen. She later called me telling me that she wanted me to see the tape. We were both in the den watching the video of the kitchen. The bathroom door in the hallway can me heard creaking open and soggy footsteps can be heard loudly. The tape turns staticy and when it clears up, a tall shadow like outline of a person can be seen walking past the kitchen table. I noticed it had no visible legs. The figure tilts its head and turns toward the camera and the whole image turns to static. My mom and I both yell out in disbelief and then a loud, guttural laugh comes from the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later, my mom and step dad decide they&amp;#39;ve had enough and they are moving. On the day of the move, I saw the landlord and I asked him about the house. He said that it was once a care facility for children with special needs. Each room used to be divided in half so it actually had eight small rooms instead of four big ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day a caretaker was bathing a child in the bathroom when the kid had a seizure. The caretaker panicked and ran for help, when he returned, he discovered the child had drowned. He was fired. Feeling guilty, the caretaker snuck into the house and slashed his wrists in the very same bathtub. He was found in the water with his boots on. I don&amp;#39;t know the validity of the landlord&amp;#39;s story, but it explains everything we experienced in that freaky house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This was in 2004, and my mom had moved about  three times after all of this occurred. She does not have the video anymore.  I wish we did, because it is a crazy story and some people will just not believe it. That&amp;#39;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Before I start, I'm going to say this is all really fucking crazy. Some people may not believe it, but this is all very true. 

My family moved into a house in Swartz Creek, Mi in 2004. It was my dad Ronald, my mom Sharlotte, my sisters Shyra and Chelsey, my brothers Ronnie and Dillon, and I. My name is Sabreena, I'm now 22, this all happened between the ages of 9-11. 

Everything was fine until I think like 2007. My dad started getting super sick and jaundice, basically his skin and the whites of his eyes were turning yellow. His mom came over and they were searching online trying to figure out what could be wrong with him and the only thing that would come up was articles on cancer. He got checked out at his doctors, and lo and behold, he had an aggressive form of pancreatic liver cancer. My dad was super healthy before all of this so it was a huge shock. A few months later my sister Shyra (my username is named after her) started to get sick as well, and she was diagnosed with Hodkin's Lymphoma, which is a form of cancer as well. Really long story short, (if you want to know more you can google the city and our names to read some news articles as to how they got sick ect, it's pretty fucked up) My dad ended up passing away 2 years later on March, 27, 2009, but it was only after my sister went into remission because he told her that he wasn't going to die if she was sick. 

After his passing, my other older sister Chelsey moved out of state to live with my uncle James in Washington state. 


So fast forward a bit, at this point my dad had been passed away for nearly 6 months, Shyra (the sister that had cancer) was home alone. My sister Chelsey told me that Shyra called her frantically sobbing saying that she had just seen my dad in the kitchen with his head down crying. She was freaked out saying that something had to be wrong and she didn't know what the hell was going on. 

2 weeks later Shyra ended up in the hospital, the cancer had spread basically throughout her whole body. She was in the hospital for a few days, and I had just turned 11 so my mom didn't want me at the hospital so I really had no clue that she was even admitted, I was just at a friend's house for a couple of days which wasn't unusual for me. 

My brother Ronnie was at the hospital with my mom because he was 17. Ronnie told me that Shyra had a tube down her throat, but she could still use her phone to type out what she wanted to say, she was awake, but weak. She pointed to the corner of the room and was trying to communicate so he gave her the phone. She typed out to him that Heaven and God were real, and that my dad was in the room along with my dad's dad, who passed away in like 2001. He asked her what they wanted and she pointed to herself. She passed away within the next 24 hours on September, 20, 2009 at the age of 19. 

I know you can say that Shyra was probably delusional or whatever because she was about to die, but get this. 

While all of that was going on in the hospital, Chelsey was still living in Washington and she got the earliest flight she could get back to Michigan. The night Shyra died was the night before Chelsey was leaving to come home. Chelsey was on the phone with my mom and Ronnie constantly so she was up super late and she had an early flight. She said she was just so exhausted from trying to make sure she knew everything that was going on with Shyra in the hospital, that she accidentally fell asleep for about an hour. 

She said that she had a dream that my dad and his cousin Jennifer (she was our second cousin and we didn't really know her, but she had died from a heroin overdose 2 months before my dad passed away) came to her in her dream saying that Shyra died and that she is with them now, and that she's okay. That dream woke Chelsey up because that last she knew Shyra was alive,  and it freaked her out. Just a few moments after she woke up my brother Ronnie called her saying Shyra just passed away and all Chelsey could say it that she already knew and told him about her dream.


EDIT: 

Someone posted links in the comments to confirm my dad and sister. 

I wanted to add this as well. On January, 10, 2010 that house caught fire. My mom went sledding with my little brother Dillon and my cousin Taylor. My sister and I were both sleeping in my mom's bed because we were all up very late the night before. We were dead asleep until my sister woke me up saying the house was on fire and that we needed to get out immediately. I was very confused and I couldn't see anything at all, not even the daylight through the window, but we ended up getting out because we knew the house so well that we didn't have to see to get out. She had 3rd degree burns on both of her hands from opening the door. We both went to the hospital for smoke inhalation and she got treated for the burns. 

We are both very heavy sleepers, we were awake until like 3 AM. People started stopping to help us when we got the front door open because smoke was pouring out of the house. We literally would have died otherwise, the doctors said we had about 30 seconds left before the smoke killed us. 

Chelsey told me that someone was saying ""Chels, wake up!"" until she got up and realized what was happening. Mind you nobody was there and I was still asleep. 

again if you don't believe me (which is super fucked up because why would i lie about any of this) just look up 8070 morrish road Swartz Creek house fire. The article wasn't fully correct because it said 3 people were there, but it was only me and my sister, we were so shook up that we didn't know if my mom, brother ect were there or not. My brother slept on the couch a lot of the time to be closer to my mom's bedroom so we thought they were still sleeping or possibly dead since we couldn't see anything at all until we noticed that my mom's truck was gone from the driveway. We broke the window to try to wake them up because the smoke that was pouring out of the door was too thick to even go near. The fire was also ruled electrical.


Edit 2:

For the people are wondering how I'm doing now, I'm doing fairly well. I have a son, he's 2 1/2 right now, I've been with his dad for 4 years. I'm okay emotionally other than wondering where I would be right now if my dad was still here, and where my older sister would be too. If she would ever find love and who she would choose to be with, if she was meant to have kids, ect. She would be 30 now. Shyra was the sibling that I was closet to, I would sleep in her bed with her every night because I was just so attached to her. She was 8 years older than me so she probably thought I was super annoying, but I wanted to be just like her. I copied her style and listened to the music she liked. We had a very special bond and it's truly a heartache knowing she isn't here anymore, and knowing she never got to experience life at all. I remember at my dad's funeral she sat next to me and we both were crying and she said ""It'll be okay, sister."" 
I'm only 22 and I feel like I haven't experienced a fraction of life yet, so knowing that she was gone before her 20th birthday is absolutely crushing. It's upsetting that my dad won't be able to walk me down the isle at my wedding someday. I think my dad took a bit of favoritism towards me because he would always tell me how special I was to him. He would do extra things for me and with me that he didn't do with my older siblings, like picking me up from my elementary school to go shopping, just him and I, or giving me little gifts to let me know he loved me. I feel like a piece of me was taken that year. It's something I will never fully recover from until we are hopefully reunited again. I don't think that I would have met the father of my child if things didn't pan out the way it did, so I think about everything leading up to having my son and put it in consideration that maybe everything happened for a reason, even if it was in a horrific way. I try to take good from the bad, I'm thankful to still have my mom and other siblings here to this day.

I just took a shower. I always sing really loudly, and today was no different. But in the middle of the shower I froze. I was just terrified for no discernible reason. After I looked at the tiny window next to me, fight or flight kicked in and I instantly ducked.

I turned off the shower and made no noise. I had no idea why, but I was certain something terrible was going to happen as soon as I made noise or looked back at that window.

What happened was, I was on my bed. For a idea it was a small room on the second floor of the house I was in. And there was the bathroom, the main room that later, I slept in, but had to move due to a family member, my grandma needing the space. What happened in my room, which was compacted tightly to a point of only one person fitting through is that, I was like I said on the bed listening to music. And then suddenly I feel a pressence of a spirit. It was probably my guess a young spirit. So I asked it, &amp;quot;do you need help?&amp;quot; To which it responded by running across the room to the pull couch. You can hear paper flying or see paper going up in the air.

,Thetruthishere,"          So this story starts out, and really ends, with me being a child growing up in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now in my late 20’s I can see in retrospect I suffered from night terrors, as well as sleep paralysis until the age of 6/7.
           I would would fall asleep in my bunk bed, and open my eyes without being able to move my body on a nightly basis. It would feel as though I was screaming from the inside of my body. I would eventually break loose, and my parents would run into the room, me still screaming, having not realizing I’m audibly screaming now in reality.
            This is the part where it gets weird, and downright creepy... I would be screaming mainly due to a reoccurring dream I would have.... Every-night my Mom or Dad would put me to bed, I would be halfway between sleep and wake, and I would see Paper Sesame Street Characters at the edge of my bed. 
            They where little cut-outs being held up by popsicle sticks. I would see these little characters, and hear voices saying “Come play with us!”, and I knew they scared me every time. 
             However, every time I would just be so intrigued ,and try to grab one....When I did a hand would drag me underneath my bunk bed, and bring me into the “void”.
            Inside this “void” there was maybe some stars in the distance, but really nothing around. When I would look out, and I would see a humanoid glowing green bunny rabbit floating about 12 feet in front of me, with spinning spiral eyes, illuminating from the inside.
             He would communicate to me telepathically knowing my name, and things about my family. I would always be scared shitless, however he was always reassuring, and calm, which made me feel as though it was a benevolent force.
             The dreams where consistent of the Glowing Green Bunny rabbit taking me under, and talking to me telepathically for hours. 
             However, on one occasion he introduced to me his family. Saying, “See I have a family just like yours. I’m a dad just like you have a dad. And this is my kid, he’s almost your age”. 
              I remember being scared shitless seeing a family of glowing bunny rabbits with spiral swirly eyes staring at me, they were all different colors.
              After around the age of 7 the night terrors stopped , and my glowing friend stopped visiting me in my dreams. I drew a lot as a kid, and my mom swears she has a picture I drew that resembles a “Grey” alien.      However, to this day I vividly remember drawing a rabbit with green fur and swirly eyes in crayon. 
             It’s an ongoing joke in my family, saying things like Area 51 since we are in Vegas, and they bring it up every once in awhile.
             The creepy thing is — get this. My cousin was talking about his night terrors one time to me and my family. There really wasn’t anything that lined up with my dreams, however he mentioned these “Paper Sesame Street characters on Popsicle sticks” that used to lure him into his basement during his “scary night terror dreams”. That coincidence freaked me out more-so than anything.

,Thetruthishere,"So this is the first of several stories I feel that I need to post on this sub.  Some will be my own, some will be my mom's, but this one in particular happened to both of us.  Regarding the title: I had the dream and my mom caught the surveillance guy.

I've always had dreams about aliens.  Aliens chasing me through the house, alien invasions, all out war between us and them.  They stopped roughly in my early twenties and I haven't been plagued since.  I still have thoughts, fears, and recollections from time to time though, especially after reading a Reddit post or finding a new (to me) subreddit like this one.  

This one particular dream is the one dream that stands out to me the most.  It happened when I was in high school, about 15 or so, roughly 16 years ago.  For context (and this is important) I don't have a relationship with my biological father.  My parents divorced when I was 5 and between then and the summer I turned 15 it was rocky.  A couple weeks after I turned 15 I had the realization about all the ways he wronged me and decided to call him out on it in hopes that he'd admit his mistakes so we could move on.  He didn't do I cut ties with him.

This is where the dream occurs.  A month or so after that, I have the dream.  In this dream I'm woken up by a bright, but dull, purplish-pinkish light.  Now, my bedroom window was a big window with a curved window just above it.  We put blinds over the big rectangular part but left the curved portion clear.  I could see the sky from this portion and that's where the light was coming from.  I could tell the sky was cloudy like a thunderstorm was occuring but there was no rain, thunder, or lightning.  The whole sky was the purplish-pinkish color.

  In the sky, half made out of clouds, half not, was a face.  If you've ever googled what the classic grey looks like and you stumble across pictures of other races, this face was that of a brown.  I've read that they're usually the leaders/captains of the crew.

Wanting a better view I peek through the blinds onto the street and see a car parked in front of my bedroom, right by our mailbox.  It was an old 70s, Cadillac style car with a man standing outside it.  I got the impression and feeling that whoever was doing all this wanted me to think it was my biological father and that I had to go with him.  But it wasn't my biological father, that I knew.  And even if it was I didn't want to go with him because of what had happened earlier that month/month prior.  So (still in the dream) I raced to my mom's bedroom, woke her up, told her what I saw and what was going on, she got out of bed as fast as she could, didn't even put on pants, we got in her car and drove away, the sky still lit up by that purplish pinkish light.

If that were the end of it Id say it was a stress dream caused by the emotional trauma I went through.  But it wasn't.  The next morning I told my mom about the dream and she told me her experience.  That night, around 2-3 am, she was woken up by a beeping under her bed, followed by a light, like a cars headlight, shining into her bedroom.  For more context, our house was on a corner with my mom's bedroom right next to the garage and her bedroom window looking out onto the main street going though the neighborhood.  The street our house was on, the street my bedroom faced with our mailbox on it ended in two cul-de-sacs on either end with the main thoroughfare street cutting it in half. 
My mom peeked through the blinds and saw an unmarked car of roughly the same make, model, and color of the car in my dream sitting at the stop sign across the main street from our house shining a light into her bedroom.  The driver must've saw her and gotten spooked because they then started driving real slow up and down our street several times, looking like they were patrolling.  

Our subdivision was relatively new and in a developing part of my small city.  Around us was all farmland.  In fact when we first moved in some 4 years prior the edge of our backyard was lined with barbed wire pasture fence and we had cows come up to us.  By the time I had the dream the subdivision grew behind us and there were more streets and houses, but the surrounding area was still farmland.  Not exactly a hive of criminal activity.  

We called the city police non emergency number to complain about being woken up by one of their patrols and they said 1.) We didn't have any patrols in the neighborhood at that time, 2.) Their patrol cars aren't unmarked, nor are they 70s Cadillac style.

,Thetruthishere,"    - [ ] I was kept away from my father pretty much my entire childhood, starting from the moment I was born. He and my mother split while she was still pregnant with me and for whatever reason she did everything in her power to make sure to keep him away from me. We even moved to another state and she always told me stories that lead me to believe it were probably better that way. Even tho my stepdad wound up being nothing but a piece of shit who liked touching little girls but anyway, he isn’t even worth me wasting one more second of my story on him, so I’ll just leave it at that. Anyways, years later I eventually moved back to my home state to live with my grandparents in the 6th grade but the wedge my mom had placed between me and my dad was already there, and since he was pretty much a complete stranger to me, our relationship continued on as an estranged one,  for many more years. Eventually, when I was 21, I decided to get over the awkwardness and my dad and I finally formed an actual father/daughter type relationship. To this day I try not to hold any resentment against my mom for keeping us away from each other but it’s hard sometimes, bc honestly he really wasn’t a bad person, and definitely not compared to the garbage that was my stepdad. I mean who doesn’t make mistakes from time to time rite? Lord knows I do.. and your a liar, any of you, that won’t agree that you sometimes do as well lol, so I was 21 the first time I called him Dad instead of calling him by name and 21 before I ever told him I loved him.. I don’t know if she honestly believed it was what was best, or if she just did it with the sole purpose of hurting him.  Anyway a year or 2 after getting close to my dad, he and I had a slight falling out that was actually over a disagreement between him and my fiancé who was a little controlling to say the least, so there were a couple of years where we really didn’t talk. A couple of years go by and I was pregnant with my 2nd child, a little girl, actually the first girl to be born in my family since me, 24 years before. People in town would often stop and tell me how excited my dad was that I was going to be giving him his first granddaughter so I decided it was time to put the bullshit behind us, I figured there had been enough lost years already so I tell my fiancé that I was going to take my son up to my dads and go surprise him for Christmas. He was totally against it but I didn’t care I’d been kept away from my dad my whole life he wasn’t gonna keep me away longer than he already had! It seemed I was finally starting to grow a backbone lol.. this was sometime around the first part of December that I made these plans. Then one night I have this dream, my dad comes to me and we sorta chit chat a bit, then we each apologized to the other and hugged that’s all I really remember. I didn’t really give it much thought, just chocked it up as one of those weird pregnancy dreams. The following day I get up and take my son to daycare, then head to work. After work I pick up my son and go to my sister in laws house and while we were sitting there talking, my cell phone rings so I pull it out of my back pocket to see it’s my mom calling. Which is weird already as she never calls me, so I answer and this is how the conversation goes..

Mom: “Sweetie did you already hear about your dad?”
Me: “umm no what the hell are you talking about what happened, is he ok?” 
Mom: “oh honey no I’m so sorry but your dad passed away last night, he had a heart attack.” 
 
This phone call was on December 15th, he died the night of the 14th, I never got to surprise him for Christmas, that’s just my typical shit luck honestly, but I like to think that he at least came to me in my dreams to let me know that he loved me and to say goodbye.. I mean, what are the odds of me having that dream, at rite around the same time he passed. The shit still kills me, 9 years later, the guilt of not making things rite with him sooner is something I’m sure I’ll always regret but it would be much worse if I hadn’t had that dream, even if that’s all it were was just a dream at least it gave me a little peace of mind..",t2_2po8d6sv,False,,0,False,More than a coincidence?,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_f677nz,False,dark,,public,240,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,240,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1582125642.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- [ ] I was kept away from my father pretty much my entire childhood, starting from the moment I was born. He and my mother split while she was still pregnant with me and for whatever reason she did everything in her power to make sure to keep him away from me. We even moved to another state and she always told me stories that lead me to believe it were probably better that way. Even tho my stepdad wound up being nothing but a piece of shit who liked touching little girls but anyway, he isn’t even worth me wasting one more second of my story on him, so I’ll just leave it at that. Anyways, years later I eventually moved back to my home state to live with my grandparents in the 6th grade but the wedge my mom had placed between me and my dad was already there, and since he was pretty much a complete stranger to me, our relationship continued on as an estranged one,  for many more years. Eventually, when I was 21, I decided to get over the awkwardness and my dad and I finally formed an actual father/daughter type relationship. To this day I try not to hold any resentment against my mom for keeping us away from each other but it’s hard sometimes, bc honestly he really wasn’t a bad person, and definitely not compared to the garbage that was my stepdad. I mean who doesn’t make mistakes from time to time rite? Lord knows I do.. and your a liar, any of you, that won’t agree that you sometimes do as well lol, so I was 21 the first time I called him Dad instead of calling him by name and 21 before I ever told him I loved him.. I don’t know if she honestly believed it was what was best, or if she just did it with the sole purpose of hurting him.  Anyway a year or 2 after getting close to my dad, he and I had a slight falling out that was actually over a disagreement between him and my fiancé who was a little controlling to say the least, so there were a couple of years where we really didn’t talk. A couple of years go by and I was pregnant with my 2nd child, a little girl, actually the first girl to be born in my family since me, 24 years before. People in town would often stop and tell me how excited my dad was that I was going to be giving him his first granddaughter so I decided it was time to put the bullshit behind us, I figured there had been enough lost years already so I tell my fiancé that I was going to take my son up to my dads and go surprise him for Christmas. He was totally against it but I didn’t care I’d been kept away from my dad my whole life he wasn’t gonna keep me away longer than he already had! It seemed I was finally starting to grow a backbone lol.. this was sometime around the first part of December that I made these plans.

,Thetruthishere,"I've told this story a couple of times and just want to keep getting it out there as it needs to be read/listened too. 

Bicester, UK 

I had a strange experience 11 years ago where I had this fascination out of the blue of ufos and feeling the need of sitting out and looking for them? I was 14 at the time and UFOs or aliens I had never thought about before. Couldn't have cared less at that age either.

The next day forced some of my family to sit in the garden with me under the stars on an amazing clear evening and we were sat talking for about 10 minutes then I noticed a strange white light just like a spotlight that you would get in your kitchen not bright but dull in colour. As if it was attached to something? Like oval in shape this is how I knew it was attached. 

This light slowly moved over the houses to the left of us no noise and stopped right in front of us probably 100ft in the air and probably 200ft away. 

Now this is where it gets weird. 

I feel this strange feeling erupt in my chest like an adrenaline rush. But wasn’t. I felt like I had lost a sense of time and where I was almost as if I was unconscious. But at the same time fixated on this light but not actually there with my body... it’s hard to explain. 

All of a sudden the light brightens and as best as I can describe pings at a speed and acceleration I have never seen in my life. 0-20000 mph maybe... seriously fast still no noise...

I lost track of it for a second then something made me look up into the sky above and I noticed the white light miles and miles up. As small as a star and then zip into space leaving a small trail of light behind it like a comet. 

My family had said nothing the whole time. We all looked at each other after and no one could say anything. I think everyone was beyond frightened that an object like that exists.

,Thetruthishere,"on september 27 my friend and i went out around 4:30am on the 28th to a church parking lot to smoke. we were smoking on the hood of my car and saw a ufo that was three lights in a line then it shifted and became a triangle then disappeared. it was flying super low and super slow and made no sound it was silent until after it left then normal nature sounds came back. a wave of anxiety and almost terror came over us as it passed over us. 

we were scared and went home and i went to the backyard to finish smoking and he went inside to try to sleep and i saw an alien in my backyard. it was a figure in a normally pitch black area between some trees, moving:bouncing slightly with a blue glow outlining it. i talked to my coworker who’s like familiar w aliens about it and she said from my description it sounded like a blue avian but anyway i stared for a few minutes then got scared and ran tf inside. then my friend and i tried to sleep but we couldn’t we took SO much melatonin but nothing happened so we started talking then at one point we stopped talking and started just talking through our minds and neither of us realized we had actually stopped speaking out loud till i was like uhhh did u hear me?? and then we started talking out loud abt how we both heard each other in our heads, it was weird. 

then i eventually fell asleep and he got stuck in a time loop where it was 6:25 and the time wouldn’t change and he tried using the stopwatch on his phone but it just stayed at 00;00 when he pressed start.  he would repeat his actions over and over again and he realized i wasn’t breathing. every time the loop happened he heard a pop in his brain and footsteps coming up the stairs getting closer every time. he would check if i was breathing and if i had a pulse which i didn’t and he’d try to shake me awake and i never responded. throughout the whole thing a voice in his head was telling him there’s conditions like we either had to join together physically into one person or we both die. 
so finally at the end the footsteps were right outside my door and he was like no no no she needs to live this isn’t happening and he traveled back in time for what felt like 7 years like he was moving and thinking all in reverse then at the end he looked and i was breathing again. he also called two of our friends while i was “dead” and told them that i was dead and they both said something along the lines of “she’ll be fine. i know you can do it” but neither of them remember answering or saying anything. they both have the call log though. 

the next morning i had an alarm set for 8 and my friend said i woke up with no emotions on my face, looked him in the eyes and my eyes looked like they had no life in them, then turned off my alarm and went back to sleep. i do not do that like i wake up to my alarm and i get up or i at least remember if i turn it off but i don’t remember anything. i finally actually woke up at 11 to my little brother banging on my door and crying bc my mom thought i was dead and like a mother knows when her child dies or whatever they feel it so don’t friend said that was weird. but anyway i didn’t know that i had died at that point i went my entire day not knowing but wondering why i felt dead i literally felt like i had woken up from the dead and i did not know why until he told me the next day what happened after i slept

,Thetruthishere,"Alright so I really don't know if this is the /best/ place to post this, but I felt like posting it just to see what other people think. 

Just some quick history: I recently moved into a new house that I'm renting with two other roommates, and we've been here since the very last week of January. Since the move in we've noticed just how much work done on the house appears to have been done by the owner, or professionals who were barely professionals. This isn't to say it's a bad house, we love it, but there's things here and there that if you pay enough attention will stick out. One of which is the fact that there are two attic doors in the garage. They're right next to each other, and one was clearly the original while the other looks new, yet doesn't have finishing touches on it, even though it does seal properly when shut (so no complaints). I decided to open the newer one and climb up a bit just to take a peak around because I'm young and haven't had much of a reason in life to ever go into an attic, so I took this as an opportunity. It was clear when I got up there that the original door was no longer a door, and had stuff like extra wood tiles ontop of it. I climbed down, and shut the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

About two hours later one of my roommates comes knocking at my door saying that when she went to take something to the recycling bin, it was still open. I got up, checked it out, and yep! It was hanging open. The ladder wasn't completely unfurled, but the door was all the way down. The reason I make this post is because after closing it again and tugging on the string that pulls it down, I noted just how much force was required to bring it down. There's actually a certain stage you have you pull past for it to /really/ open up, and if you don't go past this threshold the door snaps shut again. So I've been wondering all night... how on earth did it open itself up? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the obvious answer: the roommate did it. However I have a lot of doubt that they did this because their reaction seemed pretty genuine, and I've known them almost my entire life. So we've both been checking on it periodically, and it has yet to open again. If you ask me if I believe in the paranormal btw, I say that I believe we don't fully understand our universe yet and that I'm open to things. But I don't lean hard into ghosts or demons, even if I do have fun around other people who are superstitious and invite them in every so often. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my question, has anyone else ever had this happen? Is this possible? Should I upload a video showing how hard it is to open it in the first place to lend credence to my post?

&amp;#x200B;

For the first incident, on the night of his death my dad, his 2 siblings and my grandma all couldn't sleep. Even though he had his health problems nobody was expecting him to die so soon, so there is no reason that they were up all night. 

The second incident involved my mom's parents on the day before my grandpa died. Both of them went on vacation and stopped at some kind of airplane or Air Force museum. Throughout the day my mom's dad kept making comments about how they should buy things from the gift store like model planes or American Flags and statues of the Bald Eagle  for my grandpa. It got so frequent and random that my mom's mother asked what was wrong with him and he said, ""I don't know, I just can't get him off my mind.""

The final incident occurred with my wife. On the night of my grandpa's death she had a dream that my entire family was having a get-together on the back patio at our house.

,Thetruthishere,"I have owned my octagon house (built in 1855 and has 8 equal sides) for about 18 years. Just recently have experienced some things I can't explain. This story is 100% true and I'm not a person who necessarily believes in ghosts, spirits etc...so I'm not jumping to any conclusions or ready to sell the house just yet.

About 6 months ago, my wife and I were having issues with my 10 year old daughter sleeping in her bed. She would run into our bed every night. Not unusual as I'm sure anyone with children can attest. One night, my daughter ran into our room and jumped into bed taking up all the room and blankets. I decided to get up and sleep in her bed for the night.

At about 3:00 am, I was sleeping on my side facing my daughter’s bedroom door. I opened my eyes without moving at all and right in front of me was a dark shadow of a short person or child looking at me. No features at all, just like a black cloudy/smoky form that had a volume to it (not 2 dimensional). I didn't move or blink for about 15 or 20 seconds and it just blew away to my right... Surprisingly enough, I didn't jump out of my bed and run or anything like that. I just rolled over on my back and started to ask myself if I had really seen what I thought I did. I then looked at my phone on the floor and it was about 3:15 am. After laying there for a couple minutes, I started to get scared about what I saw and returned to my bedroom where my wife and daughter was sleeping. I climbed into bed with them and eventually went back to sleep. In the morning I told my wife but not my daughter (and never would since I don't want to scare her). I had since tried to write this off as sleep paralysis or something like that but deep down inside I was sure I was awake.

It gets crazier... just last week, my family and I were out to dinner and the subject of ghosts came up. I asked my daughter if she had ever experienced anything she couldn't explain (remember, I never told her about my experience). She then said one night in her bed she woke up and saw the shadow of a girl floating near her door! I of course didn't tell her I did as well but my wife and I locked eyes and she said we were both crazy.

,Thetruthishere,"     I have always believed in other “beings”. I like to think of them as spirits stuck between worlds, although I of course don’t have the answers nor do I care to as to what they really are. Anyways, on to the story. 
     Last Winter, my boyfriend and I were packing up to head to Lake Tahoe for an overnight for my birthday. I was very excited, had stayed the night at his the night before we left, and was all packed.
      Now, I am a very organized person. I misplace things often but do it with intention and often know where to find them when I do. However, the morning we were to leave, it seemed I had misplaced my wallet. I remember thinking weird, it was just in my purse. My boyfriend and I set out to search anyways.        He went to search the car and I went to search his room. I was throwing his comforter on the ground when all of the sudden, my attention shifted to his light. I sat on the bed and just stared at it for a moment. It was a tall standing lamp with two lights attached to it. I looked over in the other direction, and when I looked back, it was falling straight in front of me. 
      Time slowed down and as it passed me, I felt a warm sensation explode throughout my chest. It crashed to the ground and one of the two lights shattered. I ran out of the house screaming and crying, knowing my boyfriend had mentioned having a being in the house before. His parents, him, and his little sister had experienced it before, but it was my first experience with something like this. Soon after, we found my wallet sitting on the dresser, without any explanation as to how or when it got there. 
      I think about this often and without explanation, but I’ve never felt that warm sensation again, nor do I think I will.

Not really long stories but after reading a bunch of posts in this sub, a lot of people were kinda describing the same thing or experiencing at least something simmilar to my experience.

This all started last summer when i got my first job in a hotel/bar very far away from my city and since then they never stopped. 
To keep it short let me get straight in. I was working on a very very long shift (from 7am in the morning till 10-11 before midnight) and i started to get like these very uneasy feelings like someone is watching me even when i was all alone cleaning up the hall. Since i always was very tired from the work i just never really worried about it and blamed it on that, till one day i was in the reception sector looking for some paperwork i felt a double tap on my sholder like someone trying to get my attention. I immeditately turn back and no one was there. I felt really weird but as usual i thought i was just flippin out. Hours later i was rushing to the bathroom and unfortunately it was occupied and i had to wait for a bit. As i was waiting i got that same touch but now it was more powerful and it had more volume, like someone hit me with their shoulder. It hit me outta nowhere and i thought one of my coworkers was playing with me and i got so mad and sprinted the way to the bar were the bartenders were working. I asked each and everyone of them including strangers and they all sweared they did not get near me at that time. I was confused and weirded out at the same time it literally made me quit the job. 

Since that day, i hear very distorted voices and most of the time i can’t make a single word out of what i hear, i get these type of touches almost everyday it doesn’t freak me out that much anymore. It is really obstructive someties cuz i’ll be in school around people when this happnes and i act very strange, same in home, when i go out, literally everywhere. I even got my parents convinced i have some brain issues and i had to get checked for that.Some of the words i could formulate from these voices are: don’t, listen, and some weird laughs( wich are mostly rare).

It was mostly these till 3 weeks ago when i saw a dream where i was in a black room with only one window whith a slight form of light wich made it visible for me to see around. I couldnt move and i was sorrounded by some shadow moving “energy” that would take any shape or form of people i knew but with a weird shaped face.

,Thetruthishere,"
There’s this thing I do sometimes before I fall asleep and it lets me see some pretty interesting things.  So I wait until I’m on that verge of sleeping, the point where your eyes get heavy and you start dozing off.  When I’m at that point, I focus on not thinking of anything and taking mental notes of what I see. Sometimes I see locations like a skyline or mountains, trees, plains.   It’s usually scenery and it’s not like a clear picture it’s hazy, almost like looking out of a lightly fogged window where you can see things buts it’s a little out of focus. So an example of the mental notes I take would be; trees, mountains, orange sunset, light clouds.  I do these mental notes so I can remember what I’m seeing when I wake up.  I keep myself from thinking of anything else so as to make sure I’m not imagining things/ projecting images of my own will.  I don’t know what exactly to call it but I know that if my mind isn’t clear I start seeing things that I know are coming from me.  

      An example of a time I let my imagination ruin it, was the time I saw a door at the end of a hallway.  It was like a door made of of steel or metal and it had a lot of designs carved on it.  I focused on getting closer to the door and then I saw like a faint red light emitting from it.  I was filled with a sense of fear/dread and then like a voice in my head said you shouldn’t be here.  My mind starting running and then what was just a door ended up turning into people in the hall way and cartoon characters and it got really ridiculous and I knew that the location(idk what else to call it)was ruined.

     I know this already seems long but I just want to make sure you guys have an idea of what I’m talking about.  That way if anyone else has experienced this or can help me figure this out it’s easier for you.  So this one particular night I’m doing the same thing, waiting until I have that heavy sleepy feeling etc.  Right off the beginning something is strange. Everything is dark.  I almost questioned if there was just a power outage and I was just looking at my dark room, until I see this being.  The best way to describe it is if you google human wire sculpture but it had longer arms and no feet.  It looked like that but made out of energy?  It’s hard to explain it was like looking at a blue/whiteish being made of lightning bolts or something. It wasnt emitting light or anything but that’s the best way I can describe it.  We weren’t in any particular place. It seemed dark but it was more of a nothingness.  Again it’s hard to describe because the area we were in wasn’t any particular location, it was more of a feeling.  Have you ever been in a black out and the lights first go out, you stretch your arms out to feel for anything?  It’s almost like you’re blind and then you bump into something and you’re like “ok good I know exactly where in the house I am.”   The place we were in felt like that initial moment of a black out.

We proceed to have a conversation.  It wasn’t like talking to someone. It was me thinking a question and then it being answered via another voice in my head.  I asked what it was and it said “we are both the same species”.  I said I didn’t understand what it meant and it replied “we are beings experiencing a physical life”. (I’m going to type the rest as the conversation we had)
- so what makes us so different
- “Emotions”
- What about emotions makes us special
- “Emotions were engineered into our physical forms, its what keeps us tethered to our physical forms”
- So why can’t we leave our physical forms
- “Emotions were put there to give you a realistic physical experience.  We have gotten lost in our physical forms and confused them to be our true forms.”
- So I look just like you
- “Yes”
I was then confused and felt this sense of sadness like being lost and longing for something distant that I didn’t understand. I began to fall into a deeper darkness and fell asleep.  When I woke up it felt like I had the strangest dream. I don’t know what to make of it.  Was it a dream? Was it a message?  Idk if this is even the right place to post this.  If not can someone please direct me to the right place.  Has any one had a similar experience?

TLDR:  I dreamt of a being made out of energy or something who told me that we are beings experiencing a physical world.",t2_4jcy8izi,False,,0,False,"Had a conversation with a being, don’t know what to make of it.",[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_f5udui,False,dark,,public,310,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,310,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1582072276.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s this thing I do sometimes before I fall asleep and it lets me see some pretty interesting things.  So I wait until I’m on that verge of sleeping, the point where your eyes get heavy and you start dozing off.  When I’m at that point, I focus on not thinking of anything and taking mental notes of what I see. Sometimes I see locations like a skyline or mountains, trees, plains.   It’s usually scenery and it’s not like a clear picture it’s hazy, almost like looking out of a lightly fogged window where you can see things buts it’s a little out of focus. So an example of the mental notes I take would be; trees, mountains, orange sunset, light clouds.  I do these mental notes so I can remember what I’m seeing when I wake up.  I keep myself from thinking of anything else so as to make sure I’m not imagining things/ projecting images of my own will.  I don’t know what exactly to call it but I know that if my mind isn’t clear I start seeing things that I know are coming from me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  An example of a time I let my imagination ruin it, was the time I saw a door at the end of a hallway.  It was like a door made of of steel or metal and it had a lot of designs carved on it.  I focused on getting closer to the door and then I saw like a faint red light emitting from it.  I was filled with a sense of fear/dread and then like a voice in my head said you shouldn’t be here.  My mind starting running and then what was just a door ended up turning into people in the hall way and cartoon characters and it got really ridiculous and I knew that the location(idk what else to call it)was ruined.

 I know this already seems long but I just want to make sure you guys have an idea of what I’m talking about.  That way if anyone else has experienced this or can help me figure this out it’s easier for you.  So this one particular night I’m doing the same thing, waiting until I have that heavy sleepy feeling etc.  Right off the beginning something is strange. Everything is dark.  I almost questioned if there was just a power outage and I was just looking at my dark room, until I see this being.  The best way to describe it is if you google human wire sculpture but it had longer arms and no feet.  It looked like that but made out of energy?  It’s hard to explain it was like looking at a blue/whiteish being made of lightning bolts or something. It wasnt emitting light or anything but that’s the best way I can describe it.  We weren’t in any particular place. It seemed dark but it was more of a nothingness.  Again it’s hard to describe because the area we were in wasn’t any particular location, it was more of a feeling.  Have you ever been in a black out and the lights first go out, you stretch your arms out to feel for anything?  It’s almost like you’re blind and then you bump into something and you’re like “ok good I know exactly where in the house I am.”   The place we were in felt like that initial moment of a black out.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proceed to have a conversation.  It wasn’t like talking to someone. It was me thinking a question and then it being answered via another voice in my head.

,Thetruthishere,"Hello. These past few months weird coincidences have been happening to me on a daily basis. A random image or event pops in my head for no apparent reason at all at the most random times of the day then a few hours or days later it comes true. This happens to me Almost every week. Once or twice a week to be exact. Now please keep in mind I don’t think I have some kind of “magical powers” or can see into the future. But I just think it’s all coincidence but very very odd. So this is an example of what I’m “experiencing”. Yesterday I was driving to work. Listening to music. Paying attention to work. Then a “random” imagine pops in my head for a split second then goes away. This image was a image of a Gatorade in a can. Weird right? That same day after work I decided to pump gas. Felt thirsty so I walked in to my buy myself a water. When I walked up to the cashier to pay what do I see? Gatorade in a can. Odd. A more disturbing situations that happened to me was a few weeks ago. I was with my girlfriend. We were eating dinner at some sushi spot. As the waiter come up to me and ask for my order I zoned out for a split second and got a image of a white owl staring at me dead in the eyes. Then I zoned backed and continued to order. Three days later I’m driving home on a Friday night. There was construction the usual route i take home going to my friends house so I had to take a different route. It was around 1 am on a Friday night and I was the only car in that road. Then suddenly I something small in the middle of the road from a distance. Almost resembling a small child. It creeped me out for a bit so I tuned in my high beams as I got closer. Then soon came to realize its a owl. Chilling dead center of my lane. I told myself “no fucken way dude” so I drove closer to the owl. I was maybe 20 ft away from the owl and it wouldn’t move an inch. It just kept staring it me. I stared at it for a few seconds. So I went around it. Driving away looking at my rearview mirror I realize the owl was still staring. So I just went about my night. Another disturbing image that I got happened recently. On Friday. I was out grocery shopping. Looking for some meet for a BBQ and I had a mental thought of some lady dressed in blue jeans and a brown hoodie and she was in the floor. Her body laid motionless then suddenly began twitching at having a seizure. Then the image went away. This image was literally in my head for a split second. The next day me and my girlfriend decide to go to Disneyland since we are both annual pass holders. We were walking to a ride (haunted mansion) and come to find out it was close for renovation. As we found out it was closed we made a complete 180 turn and to go back the other direction we were coming from. At the corner of my eye I see someone just drop. My instinct told me to look at that direction. At first I thought some one had fallen or trip. But turns old it was just an elderly lady having a seizure.   

These kinds of things have been happening to my for months now. Every week now. I’ve been writing down everything that’s been happening on my notes.

,Thetruthishere,"Hey all I'm a lurker that enjoys these encounters and stories and I've finally built up enough confidence to share some experiences I've been having since march. I know that many people here like anywhere else are often questioned about their mental health and I'd like to reassure everyone that I don't have any mental health issues and that I'm not paranoid. So let's begin.

So back in March or April of last year I wanted to investigate a topic that is common knowledge, but I believe doesn't have enough attention. Supposedly transformers films had the highest military involvement in any sci-fi movies. So eventually after spending countless hours trying to find any theories or articles that weren't a copy and paste or just regurgitating other articles/theories I decided to give a FOIA request a shot. So I sent a FOIA to SOCOM and the CIA with the main topic for information on funding/involvement in films or toy companies(out of a hunch). Then for the other two information topics I said, eh whatever and for the second topic I requested info regarding aliens, military encounters with aliens, etc.(out of a hunch) Then the third was just a lob because I couldn't think of anything and asked for info regarding any joint military-alien alliances.(a tiny hunch) Obviously I decided to keep the last two topics in theme with the movie research. I believe it was within ten-twenty minutes that I got a message basically saying fuck off from SOCOM. So then it just became a wait for a response from the CIA. 

This is when things began to get interesting. So I started the next day as any other day, I woke up, got ready for the day, said goodbye to my GF and went to the gym. After completing my workout, I began walking home in the direction of the Dunkin donuts. I got up to the sidewalk in between the main road and the Dunkin parking lot and suddenly a guy with a camera walks up to me and asks if I'd like to answer some questions for his college project. I became kind of suspicious due to the fact that there were about five other people he could've asked in the parking lot and he looked pretty old to be in college. So just out of curiosity I decided to take part in it. So he asked me two questions which I can't remember, but my reply to one of them was ""amazing"". Then he told me to write my answer in a crayola sketch book which weirdly had ""God's plan"" written on every page except for one. Once I wrote it down, he had me go behind Dunkin to take a picture of me holding the sketch book. We did, I gave him my number and that was the end of it. 

Two weeks or so later I was walking through town with a friend, I was basically her babysitter and she was in the fire academy so we headed over to the police/fire department. Three of my other friends happened to be there for an issue with their vehicle. So we began talking and a sheriff pulls into the front parking lot of the police station. We were facing away from the sheriff's direction, he walked up on what used to be the stairs of the main entrance to the station and at this second I just so happened to turn my head to look behind us and caught the sheriff taking a picture of us with an iPhone. He then went back to his car and left and the rest of the day was normal.

About two months later with no contact whatsoever, the man who took my photo somehow tracked me down in the middle of town and gave me a copy of the photo. Which looks like a complete mugshot as he focused more on my face than the sketch pad. He then said ""some people said that you look like a survivor."" Then he left and disappeared, I've haven't seen him ever since.

Then shortly after my technology begins to act strange. My Xbox 360 which is basically a DVD player at this point begins turning on by itself regardless if it was unplugged or not. This happened for several months and eventually stopped, it happened again a few days ago. Twice. Then my phone signal began acting weird, the signal began going up and down frantically and has on occasion lost all service for a few seconds. It has been like this for the phone I'm using now and the one prior. Also just recently, my phone has started transmitting my location even though I always have location turned off, the little logo pops up in the info/notification bar. At my old apartment and now my new. This occasionally happens with my bluetooth stuff as well where their signals are terrible for a while.  Recently, I've done little tests and noticed that it goes back to normal for an hour in the morning and an hour around midnight. As if someone is tampering with it, stops and then resumes.

Now we get to the even weirder stuff that has happened within the last three to four months that has begun getting more and more constant. My GF and I have been going to the gym at around midnight for several months now and we're usually with a bunch of regulars. We go outside for a fifteen minute break we'll notice vehicles that slow down to the point it seems like a staredown. This also sometimes happens when we're working out as well. Usually these vehicles are the same from cars to SUV's and from trucks to mini-vans, then there's the occasional creepy utility van and I know law enforcement has some vans because I've been stopped by some in the past when they're hunting people. Mind you this is at around midnight, the streets are completely empty, all the businesses are closed, cleaning crews have already gone home. Some gym regulars have witnessed the strangeness as well. Then twice me and my gf have had someone film us from within the gym to the point we've gotten creeped out and left in the middle of the workout. 

Last night after a long day of experiencing many of the things above. I was in the bathroom going through constipation from taco bell, my gf heard beeping and then something tapped my window and it faded away. There's​ no trees by my windows and it happened twice, just minutes apart from each other. Also we're on the third level of the apartment building.

This is what I can remember so far over the past year and I'm not clear on why it's happening. Again, I don't have any mental issues and I'm never a paranoid person, I only get paranoid over bills or prepping for events that require me to dress up.

Was my nightmare actually a reality??? HELP

Okay, so this is my first post on here, and I am also using my phone so I am sorry if something comes out wrong or whatever. I don’t even know where to start, but bare with me, this will probably be long. 

*Note that I have always been into the paranormal and had been using ouija boards for a very long time, even around this time and continued afterward*

Back to the point. In October 2018, I had a very ‘real’ feeling nightmare and I’ve always remembered it and have been very confused and left with no explanation. 
I was somewhere in the middle of the open, and I was alone. I remember that there was a large pool and there were these men in long black cloaks with white paint on their faces, every one the same, and black paint on their eyes and cheeks. Wherever I was, I had noticed there were a couple, normal people, not in cloaks, no face paint. Except they were being drowned in the large pool by these cloaked men, as if they were being punished? They would die, and then come back to life the relive the drowning. Over and over. 
After this my dream shifted to me being in some sort of library, and I see the same couple messing with a few books. I knew they shouldn’t have been doing it, it felt very wrong. I think maybe they were in trouble for that?? Idk. But the same men had came to get them ( I think my dream had played out backwards). 
And then it shifted again. This time, I was back outside but someone that I didn’t know and couldn’t see their face (not a cloaked person) was leading me down a cement stairwell going underground. (To describe it, i was going down and it was dark and at the end of the steps is a well and to your right is an opening to a large, very VERY dark room that was also cement) the man I was with told me to turn the light on (on the inside of said room) and I was scared shitless and told him I couldn’t. I don’t know why but I was absolutely terrified of sticking my arm in that room. So this man turns the light on, and all of the sudden what seemed like 100s of the cloaked men where there, all looking the same, staring at me as if they know I wasn’t supposed to be there.  They looked like they literally kept multiplying. They looked at me like they wanted to kill me and then I woke up. 

So the reason why I question if this was some sort of reality and I “went” somewhere in my dream, was because for about a week afterwards, I kept seeing online the lead singer from a metal band “GHOST” I believe is the band name, he looked EXACTLY like these men with his face paint etc. I looked further into it and it turns out he worships satan. I have never seen pictures of this man, never even heard of the band. This happened the next day when I discovered it and he kept popping up for a while. Idk. Could be a coincidence but I guess I just wanted to know what other people think... do you think i could’ve went somewhere potentially dangerous? Maybe I astral projected or something? Idk. Also I am sorry if anything came off sounding bad in this post I just generally have no idea of what happened, it just felt so real. Any advice would be nice. It hasn’t happened since.

,Thetruthishere,"TLDR: I felt really uneasy while making my homework alone, and then strange sounds started appearing 

I'm on mobile, so I am sorry for the format.

Rural Area in the PHILIPPINES - 9:30PM, tonight 

I was alone in our family room, making my homework. While writing, I suddenly felt uneasy and paranoid. It felt like someone or something was watching me. I was going to stop making my homework but I really wasn't in the mood for cramming.

I continued writing and thinking about my surroundings. Why do I feel so uneasy? Could someone or something be watching me? If so, who or what? Where? Why? I kept questioning myself because I was scared for no apparent reason. 

Suddenly, out of nowhere, I hear a sound downstairs. It sounded like a spoon banging on a glass. It started slow and soft, but the more I listened, the faster and harder it got. I thought I went crazy due to the paranoia. What caused me to believe this sound was real? Simple, it was my dog.

My dog, which was sleeping beforehand, woke up when the sound appeared. The dog looked confused, as if it was asking ""What the heck is that sound?"" The weird part was when my dog went near the stairs and just started staring at a specific section in the living room downstairs. 

I started to jot down anything I could find for my homework. I knew that I had to finish this quickly because I was getting frightened by this lingering sound. When I did finish, I ran to my sister's room and returned the school supplies that I borrowed. I was hesitant to go back but I had to because my phone and other things were there.

I walked back to the area and surprisingly, the sound was gone and my dog was playing with it's toy. However, the feeling of paranoia was still there. As I hurriedly grabbed my headphones, I swear I heard a man's voice.  It sounded like he was saying ""hehe"" but in a distorted way.

,Thetruthishere,"Since a bit after Christmas of last year, there had been many sightings every night from 6 pm to 11 pm of unidentified flying objects in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The news and government have addressed this, they called them ""drones"". I think they should not be calling them drones because they really didnt know what they are, so they should be called UFOs. But for convenience, I'm going to call them drones. 

Even with news articles or reports time and time again; they never gave an answer to what they are. They described the drones as having a wingspan of 6 feet and they can travel as fast as 60 mph (and can travel even faster in some cases) and travel for many miles.. these descriptions are unlike any other drone that exists.

 I live in Colorado and I've seen at least 4 (if not more) every night that I'm out. These drones move so fast, they have blinking lights, sometimes multiple.

 I've seen four different types of drones. One that has 6 blinking lights. Three of them are yellow and bigger than the others, two are green and smaller than the yellow, and one is red and the same size as the green. I first saw that kind of drone when the sun was still going down and there was still light in the sky. I saw a shape against the lit sky that was harboring the lights. It was a diamond-like shape, with rounded edges. People have argued with me that this was a plane, but this was NOT a plane. It didnt look anything like a plane.

The next kind of drone that I've seen is one I've only seen when the sky was dark. It has one blueish-white blinking light. The light would blink about 6 times very quickly then go dark for a second,  then appear again in a completely different spot in the sky. They had straight paths though. They wouldnt just appear in a random spot. It was in a set spot. It was odd.

And the next drone that I've seen is one that looks similar to a plane. Almost the same lights, just a tiny bit different. And I can tell it's not a plane because they move so fast, a lot faster than a plane or a jet would fly. They can hover too. Which is something that a jet nor a plane can do. 

And four, this one looks similar to a shooting star. It has one white light. It doesn't blink. It also moves so fast. One time on my way home, I was close to my house when I saw one of these drones fly over my house. It moved so fast and it dissapeared into the night just a few seconds after I saw it.

 I've never seen a single one of these ""drones"" up close. I've only ever seen one when it's hovering or moving in the sky in the evening, since the drones all stay at least 300 feet away from buildings. 

There have been many theories about them. But the few most talked about ones are 
1.) They're aliens. 
2.) They're government aircrafts that are looking for a misplaced nuke that's somewhere in the Colorado/Nebraska/Wyoming area.
3.) They're drug carriers.

Planes have even had problems with them. With the drones flying too high, and getting in their way.

But many people know the truth no matter what the government or news says; these drones are real. The truth is here, these drones are real.",t2_3ang04w2,False,,0,False,"Drones/UFOs in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming.",[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,3,0,False,t3_f5l9gb,False,dark,,public,16,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Aliens/UFOs,False,16,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1582025327.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a bit after Christmas of last year, there had been many sightings every night from 6 pm to 11 pm of unidentified flying objects in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The news and government have addressed this, they called them &amp;quot;drones&amp;quot;. I think they should not be calling them drones because they really didnt know what they are, so they should be called UFOs. But for convenience, I&amp;#39;m going to call them drones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with news articles or reports time and time again; they never gave an answer to what they are. They described the drones as having a wingspan of 6 feet and they can travel as fast as 60 mph (and can travel even faster in some cases) and travel for many miles.. these descriptions are unlike any other drone that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Colorado and I&amp;#39;ve seen at least 4 (if not more) every night that I&amp;#39;m out. These drones move so fast, they have blinking lights, sometimes multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen four different types of drones. One that has 6 blinking lights. Three of them are yellow and bigger than the others, two are green and smaller than the yellow, and one is red and the same size as the green. I first saw that kind of drone when the sun was still going down and there was still light in the sky. I saw a shape against the lit sky that was harboring the lights. It was a diamond-like shape, with rounded edges. People have argued with me that this was a plane, but this was NOT a plane. It didnt look anything like a plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next kind of drone that I&amp;#39;ve seen is one I&amp;#39;ve only seen when the sky was dark. It has one blueish-white blinking light. The light would blink about 6 times very quickly then go dark for a second,  then appear again in a completely different spot in the sky. They had straight paths though. They wouldnt just appear in a random spot. It was in a set spot. It was odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the next drone that I&amp;#39;ve seen is one that looks similar to a plane. Almost the same lights, just a tiny bit different. And I can tell it&amp;#39;s not a plane because they move so fast, a lot faster than a plane or a jet would fly. They can hover too. Which is something that a jet nor a plane can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And four, this one looks similar to a shooting star. It has one white light. It doesn&amp;#39;t blink. It also moves so fast. One time on my way home, I was close to my house when I saw one of these drones fly over my house. It moved so fast and it dissapeared into the night just a few seconds after I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen a single one of these &amp;quot;drones&amp;quot; up close. I&amp;#39;ve only ever seen one when it&amp;#39;s hovering or moving in the sky in the evening, since the drones all stay at least 300 feet away from buildings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many theories about them. But the few most talked about ones are 
1.) They&amp;#39;re aliens. 
2.) They&amp;#39;re government aircrafts that are looking for a misplaced nuke that&amp;#39;s somewhere in the Colorado/Nebraska/Wyoming area.
3.) They&amp;#39;re drug carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planes have even had problems with them. With the drones flying too high, and getting in their way. The government have claimed that they&amp;#39;re doing what they can about these drones.. but I&amp;#39;ve even seen articles where the news were claiming that &amp;quot;the drones dont exist, and that they have never existed.&amp;quot; But many people know the truth no matter what the government or news says; these drones are real. The truth is here, these drones are real.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"I posted this in a UFO related sub, but I thought people may find it interesting here too. Sorry for the length, but it involves three incidents that I believe are all connected. 

I have had three encounters involving UFOs between 2003 and 2005. I was born and raised in Northern California in the Sacramento Valley. It is an incredibly rural area surrounded by orchards and cattle pastures. On August 17th 2003 I was driving from my Grandmother's home in Gridley, California to my home in Live Oak, California. This is a roughly 7 mile drive, I take the back road, Township Road and at 10:00 PM, there was absolutely no one around on the road. 

I was surrounded by orchards and farm houses. My 1986 Ford LTD would always have electrical problems and it was no shock to me when my lights started flashing erratically on their own. The radio started getting nothing but hissing static. I pulled over, thinking my alternator was going out.      

     The moment I stopped the car, I noticed an incredibly bright blue light coming from across the street on my left. I looked over at the orchard and I saw a triangle shaped craft hovering about ten feet above the tree. There was a column of bright blue light coming out of the craft and illuminating the dirt on the ground. The triangle rotated slowly but made no noises whatsoever. Around the edges of the craft were pulsating blue lights, but every other feature of the craft was glossy black. 

The craft itself was very wide, yet it was probably less than six feet tall. My automatic locks in the car were moving up and down. I shut the car off and I opened the door, I was contemplating walking across the street and into the orchard to get a better look. The moment I stepped my foot onto the street I felt incredibly dizzy and nauseous. In that moment, I thought that something horrible would happen to me if I went closer to the object.

 This was before I had a cell phone and there were no cars anywhere around me. I quickly closed my door and tried to start my car. It started easily and I drove as fast as I could. I looked in the mirror behind me and saw that the craft was still there. I told my younger brothers, but I kept it to myself, mostly. 

This was a small town and I was already seen as the weird writer, artist guy. I didn't want to be mocked even more than I already was. To be honest, Beale Air Force Base is about 30 miles from where I saw the craft and the first thing I thought was that this had to be some find of test flight. Then I realized that if this were a top secret, silent stealth craft, why the hell would it be out in the open. This was a small town, but not exactly desolate. There were homes a few miles away from where I had stopped the car, if this was the government’s idea of a secret, they were doing a lousy job.

     A year later (I don't have the exact date, but it was in August as well), I was in Gridley, California at my Grandma and Grandpa's farm on French Avenue. They have eight acres of property and there are other farms surrounding them. About a mile away is a huge wildlife refuge called Grey Lodge. The stars light up the night sky because there is practically zero light pollution, especially on a moonless night like the one in question. My father and I had just bailed the hay in the pasture and we were staring up at the sky. 

Miles above us was an object zooming through the night sky, it was egg shaped and all we could really make out was a vibrant bright yellow light. My dad and I watched as the craft dropped rapidly toward the ground and suddenly stopped in mid air and hung in the air. If that wasn't odd enough, the craft shot back up and started doing loops in the air. My dad kept saying that this had to be from Beale Air Force base because of the way the aircraft was moving. It would hang in midair and suddenly appear on the left, then the right. It repeated these movements for about five minutes. 

Then, it dropped down, plummeting toward the earth. Once again, the craft stopped and hung in the air. This time, without any sound at all, the craft split in two sections, each flying in separate directions. My dad just shook his head and started complaining. “How much do you think this fucking bullshit costs us taxpayers?” I laughed at him and we both went inside. I wasn’t so certain that this craft was from the base. Nothing on this planet moves like that. This craft was so fast, it almost appeared to teleport. It’s movements were fluid and graceful almost as if the sky itself was water and it was swimming through a sea of stars.

     Living so close to Beale Air Force Base, my family and I would often attend the annual air shows. I’ve seen all manner of aircraft performing stunts and I’ve never seen anything move like that, let alone split into two pieces. My last experience also has something to do with Beale Air Force Base. It was on January 16th, 2005. It was my 23rd birthday and I usually try to celebrate with a solo driving adventure. I decided to drive from my Grandmother’s home in Gridley, CA to a small gold mining town called Grass Valley. It’s a very cool little town that has many of its historical, Victorian era buildings still in tact. 

There is also an abandoned insane asylum nearby that attracts ghost hunters. I just wanted to browse through the old book stores and shops. I was there for hours. At the time, I had a cell phone, but it wasn’t that dependable and this far up in the hills, the reception was a bit of a gamble anyway. When night fell, I decided to head for home. I had a much better car, a 1995 Oldsmobile. 

This car was a lot more dependable than my previous car, but I didn’t want to get stuck on the side of the road with a so-so cell phone. When I stopped to get gas, there was a beat up red studebaker pickup truck next to me. Its owner was a portly oldman with a long, bushy beard. As I pumped gas, he stared down the freeway and started laughing. I saw headlights coming our way from the highway. The old man turned next to me and asked if I lived around there. 

I told him no and he said that there have been a lot of military vehicles driving down the Nevada City Highway through Grass Valley for the past few days. He noticed that at around 8 or 9, a convoy of camouflaged trucks with government license plates would roll through town. Every single night it would be around the same time. It was 8:30 and a lot of trucks were headed our way. While it was dark, the lights from the gas station lit up the road enough to see the green trucks roll by. Each one had a canvas top over the bead of the truck. The first ten or so trucks were nearly identical military trucks. The kind you see in every episode of M.A.S.H. then there were two black Lincoln Continentals that drove past, followed by an enormous flatbed truck.

 A large black tarp was draped over a large, gun metal grey oval shaped object. There were two more Lincoln’s following the truck. After that, they were gone as fast as they came. I asked the old man where he thought they were going. He turned to me and laughed. I’ll never forget what he told me. “Don’t you know, Beale is the new Area 51.” Once he gassed up, the old man jumped in his truck and drove away. I drove back home with an eerie feeling. If this was a secret government project, this was a terrible way to keep a secret. ",t2_5ipqs4rx,False,,0,False,A new Area 51 in Northern California?,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,3,0,False,t3_f4yh8v,False,dark,,public,109,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Aliens/UFOs,False,109,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1581921055.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this in a UFO related sub, but I thought people may find it interesting here too.

My father and I had just bailed the hay in the pasture and we were staring up at the sky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miles above us was an object zooming through the night sky, it was egg shaped and all we could really make out was a vibrant bright yellow light. My dad and I watched as the craft dropped rapidly toward the ground and suddenly stopped in mid air and hung in the air. If that wasn&amp;#39;t odd enough, the craft shot back up and started doing loops in the air. My dad kept saying that this had to be from Beale Air Force base because of the way the aircraft was moving. It would hang in midair and suddenly appear on the left, then the right. It repeated these movements for about five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it dropped down, plummeting toward the earth. Once again, the craft stopped and hung in the air. This time, without any sound at all, the craft split in two sections, each flying in separate directions. My dad just shook his head and started complaining. “How much do you think this fucking bullshit costs us taxpayers?” I laughed at him and we both went inside. I wasn’t so certain that this craft was from the base. Nothing on this planet moves like that. This craft was so fast, it almost appeared to teleport. It’s movements were fluid and graceful almost as if the sky itself was water and it was swimming through a sea of stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Living so close to Beale Air Force Base, my family and I would often attend the annual air shows. I’ve seen all manner of aircraft performing stunts and I’ve never seen anything move like that, let alone split into two pieces. My last experience also has something to do with Beale Air Force Base. It was on January 16th, 2005. It was my 23rd birthday and I usually try to celebrate with a solo driving adventure. I decided to drive from my Grandmother’s home in Gridley, CA to a small gold mining town called Grass Valley. It’s a very cool little town that has many of its historical, Victorian era buildings still in tact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also an abandoned insane asylum nearby that attracts ghost hunters. I just wanted to browse through the old book stores and shops. I was there for hours. At the time, I had a cell phone, but it wasn’t that dependable and this far up in the hills, the reception was a bit of a gamble anyway. When night fell, I decided to head for home. I had a much better car, a 1995 Oldsmobile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This car was a lot more dependable than my previous car, but I didn’t want to get stuck on the side of the road with a so-so cell phone. When I stopped to get gas, there was a beat up red studebaker pickup truck next to me. Its owner was a portly oldman with a long, bushy beard. As I pumped gas, he stared down the freeway and started laughing. I saw headlights coming our way from the highway. The old man turned next to me and asked if I lived around there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him no and he said that there have been a lot of military vehicles driving down the Nevada City Highway through Grass Valley for the past few days. He noticed that at around 8 or 9, a convoy of camouflaged trucks with government license plates would roll through town. Every single night it would be around the same time. It was 8:30 and a lot of trucks were headed our way. While it was dark, the lights from the gas station lit up the road enough to see the green trucks roll by. Each one had a canvas top over the bead of the truck. The first ten or so trucks were nearly identical military trucks. The kind you see in every episode of M.A.S.H. then there were two black Lincoln Continentals that drove past, followed by an enormous flatbed truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large black tarp was draped over a large, gun metal grey oval shaped object. There were two more Lincoln’s following the truck. After that, they were gone as fast as they came. I asked the old man where he thought they were going. He turned to me and laughed. I’ll never forget what he told me. “Don’t you know, Beale is the new Area 51.” Once he gassed up, the old man jumped in his truck and drove away. I drove back home with an eerie feeling. If this was a secret government project, this was a terrible way to keep a secret. &lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"So, I recently realized after reading all of the ""shadow people"" posts on here that I may have encountered one a few years back.

A few years ago, I was super interested in Lucid Dreaming and trying to successfully lucid dream. During that time, I only had 2 successful Lucid dream experiences. This story is from the one that most stands out and scared the crap out of me. In the dream, I was driving my old junker truck down a dark, winding road near my house. It was night, and I realized that there were no street lights. I found this odd, because I knew that there were normally street lights on this particular road. At the same time, the truck started sputtering and eventually broke down there in the middle of the dark. I immediately realized I was dreaming, but the problem was, I was completely paralyzed. My windows were open and I could see around me because the moon was full and illuminated my surroundings. Then, I saw ""him""(it?) . a few feet away, on the other side of the road, stood a completely black figure. The moon was at its back and I could just tell that it was staring at me despite not having any features. At this point, I began to panic and told the dream ""If this is a dream, then i demand to move my body parts now""... nothing happened. I then tried ""I demand for the sun to come up and for there to be light now!"".... still nothing. I had taken my eyes off the shadow and when I looked back at him, he was noticeably closer. I was surprisingly calm, despite being terrified in this moment and continued trying to change the environment to no avail. I looked away again, and when i looked back, the shadow was crouched at my window. (looking back, this actually cracks me up because I have no idea what it was trying to do)  
At this point, I was trying with all of my mental and physical might to move my body, and i succeeded. My right arm decided to somewhat cooperate with me and I managed to fling it haphazardly across the rest of my body, out the window, and onto the shoulder of the Shadow. This was enough to scare me into waking up.

,Thetruthishere,"My best friend and I are out of college, and this happened to us when we were both in the 5th grade together, around 2007. We are here together writing and recalling this story now.

We were both sitting in my finished basement watching “Salad Fingers”, that viral YouTube video that blew up around that time. There is a big window on the back wall of the basement, taking up almost the entire wall horizontally, which we were near at the time of this incident. Behind my house is a little yard and then woods for a half a mile before a main road. We were sitting next to each other in the middle of the room, with my laptop propped up. My friend was facing the horizontal window, and I was facing towards her.

While we were in the middle of the video, within 1 second, the room went completely black, flashed very brightly, and then pure red. We were still able to make out everything clearly; the room was just illuminated in a red hue. This was followed by the BIGGEST deafening crash coming from the big horizontal window that consumed the entire room. We whipped our heads over and saw the window wavering and shaking. We can best compare it to plexiglass being wiggled around. We both SCREAMED and our instinct in the moment told us it was that a deer jumping into the window. It was so scary.

After that, without any hesitation, we both looked at each other and BOLTED UP THE STAIRS.

My parents were upstairs relaxing in the living room. They looked at us and I asked, “DID YOU SEE THAT?” as my friend asked ""DID YOU HEAR THAT?"" They both looked at each other, confused, and said “What?” We described what had happened just downstairs a minute ago and they did not understand, kind of thinking that we just making things up.

Later on that night, we went downstairs to the horizontal window to see if there was any glass on the ground. There was not, and everything was in it's place. There was no electrical problem in my house at the time or any sort of red light, just regular lamps. We both leaned up against the window and pushed it together, and it would NOT BUDGE. We have no idea what that combination of events was and still think about it more than a decade later.

,Thetruthishere,"This happened literally minutes ago, and I will best describe what the literal HELL happened.

So, I was walking home after work, at around 11pm. 

Now, I’ve always been afraid of the forest that attaches to my property. It’s dark, scary and there was also a cougar attack in it. I did have a light, and my boxcutter, in case I need to use it, and right when I stepped foot on the gravel path of the park. I hear “huuu (Best I can describe it, if someone wants to help debunk it to be an animal)”. I almost lept out of my pants when I heard it, and it seemed to be coming from the direction of the stream nearby.

I quickly flashed my light in the direction, couldn’t see anything. Confused, I began walking into the forest more, just wanting to get home, when I hear it LITERALLY behind my back “huuuu”. That time I lept out of my pants. I scrambled backwards looking around for the thing making it. I yelled “WHO ARE YOU” “WHAT DO YOU WANT”.

That’s when the freakiest sh*t happened. I heard the noise about 500meters in the direction I was going to go, as my dad didn’t want my shoes muddy. It was like it randomly teleported in that direction, cause it couldn’t have gotten there that quick. 

I BOLTED home, as fast as I could. I quickly pressed the keycode and ran up the really steep hill my property has and all the way home.

,Thetruthishere,Since the day i could remember i've had this strange reoccurring dream of pure black and white TV like static. There would be no noise and often it would look as the walls were moving. The feeling of it was claustrophobic and i felt entrapped or even had a feeling of suffocating at times. Almost three times a week i'd wake from these dreams in a puddle of my own sweat and once even had to throw up because i felt motion sick. I told my parents and they thought i was delusional or i had problems. I went to a therapist for a few years to try and ease the stress these dreams put on me. I told him what i was experiencing and he gave me a calendar to track the amount of times the dreams occurred. I know theres a conspiracy about reoccurring dreams and what not but it gets stranger. With my therapist not being of much help i called to the internet. Many people said they'd never had a dream like that and that it was very unnatural for a dream to be be so bland but so terrifying to induce sweat like a nightmare. Over the past few years things have simmered down. I rarely if ever get the dreams of being in a moving static void but if i do it still causes me to sweat bullets. My best guess is it's a phobia i have that's only triggered when i'm asleep as looking at static awake doesn't affect me at all.

My best guess is it&amp;#39;s a phobia i have that&amp;#39;s only triggered when i&amp;#39;m asleep as looking at static awake doesn&amp;#39;t affect me at all. Whether this is a strange case of a phobia i only have while asleep or a weird phenomenon i&amp;#39;m not aware of yet i need answers because i haven&amp;#39;t gotten one for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Here’s some context before I get to the strange noises: I moved into a new house with my family at the end of December. We moved to a new state and my parents had a house built, because it was the first time they ever were able to do so. I’m a broke college student that’s trying to save money where ever they can. So when my parents said I could stay with them and just pay $300 in rent a month I immediately agreed. I live in the basement with my parents room just above mine. The basement is a more modern day basement. Meaning it has a walk out (doors leading to the back yard) and full size windows. 

About a week after we moved in I got home from work a bit later than expected. Normally I work morning shift, but I got stuck working an evening shift and the night shift was late to replace me. So I ended up getting home around midnight. After I changed out of my work clothes I laid down in bed and was starting to drift off when I heard a loud bang outside my window. 

Now I’m an avid horror fan and a follower of real life unexplained phenomenon. However, because of this I’m very skeptical of things I can’t explain. So naturally I shrugged it off the first time I heard it and went to sleep. Then another week later I was woken up again by a banging. This time I blamed it on auditory hallucination. Like maybe I had imagined hearing it because I was just waking up. It made sense in my half asleep mind, but the more I thought about it the more I realized the noise woke me up so I couldn’t have imagined it. 

Around the same time I started notice a tapping noise on my window. That I later found out was caused from my parents walking above me and my vent not being secured correctly. So I thought the banging was being caused by something similar. However, this banging noise only happens late at night after my parents are already asleep. It happens every day for a number of weeks then goes quite for a week and starts back up again the same way. There’s never any foot prints outside my window in the morning and I’ve never seen someone standing outside when I go to check it out. 

I’m at a complete loss of what could be causing this noise. I’m really freaked out by it and I dread staying up later than 9pm because I know the banging will start around then. I know I’m not crazy because my mom has told me she’s heard it a few times and my dog normally starts to growl right before I hear the banging. 

Has anyone else experienced this? What should I do? My parents are talking about getting a camera installed facing towards the backyard corner my window is in, but that most likely won’t help. I don’t think the noises are human made. I don’t know what it is. I’m just scared and looking for answers. Can anyone give me some advice on how to proceed from here?

,Thetruthishere,"First I want to say that this isn’t super interesting or conspiracy worthy, I’m also going to post this to /glitch_in_the_matrix because these two subs seem like the best place for a post like this. 

I’ve had re-occurring dreams since I was younger. I remember the first one I had was very imaginative, it was a girl in a hospital gown, very grudge-like, dancing around my front lawn / driveway at the time. It felt very ominous to me and I’m unaware if the feeling began before or after those dreams, but there was a strong presence in that house. Once I heard crying coming from a room when no one was home and I called my grandma panicking and ran outside to wait for her to pick me up. Eventually the TV started turning on in the middle of the night in pure loud static. That never stopped leading to us moving out. My whole body would freeze and I would cover my ears until it ended. 

Fast forward to me, 23 now. My dreams honestly scare me and have been reoccurring since 19 or so. That also happened to be when I picked therapy back up, and I began having dreams of traumatic experiences with family members, most of the time now deceased ones are still alive in the dream and I’m younger. Then there are ones that seem like mumbo jumbo lost inside my subconscious; I’m always lost in the same places and running from someone. But then there are the dreams that leave me scared to go to sleep because they feel more like a memory I cannot recall. 

There’s this one house I’m always going to or running from, there’s something there that I have to hide from, a dark presence. Most of the time I dream of an attic-like hidden bedroom. I can’t help feeling like I know that room.

The other one hasn’t occurred as often as that but it left me with anxiety. I just remember watching a planet blow up, basically, the entire sky went bright and everything. I had my family beside me, and it gave me just a huge sense of apocalyptic dread.


I dream about water, sharks, drowning and tsunamis a lot, apparently water dreams are a sign of intense emotions so those make sense to me and may be why I dream of space sometimes too. I have been in a lot of planes as well. Mostly what gets to me is the eery feelings I cannot shake along with those dreams. I don’t know if it’s possible that I am seeing some other timeline in the past or future but the planet blowing up one especially gives me anxiety. And I keep expecting to one day find that room.

After getting out, (and also getting really bad vibes like very creepy shit) find out one of my friends was recording, we all saw the tape, and in one particular part of the tape, we heard like if someone punched a piano (like no joke) no one made a single noise in the shop. We were all scared are first and we were so scared we just went home, getting home I don’t know why, I got this feeling that someone was watching, and my intuition said that I should throw away the objects I robbed, I don’t know why but when I walked away from the shop I felt wayyy better.
But I got a question, was it a good idea to throw away the objects I robbed? Pls help.

My friend also robbed some stuff, a old clock and a lighter that could play music (how in the world?!) he said the clock was fine, but the lighter gave him really bad vibes and made him feel creeped. Can he keep it, or should also throw it?

,Thetruthishere,"This event happened in Austin, TX in July early 2000's. My then husband and daughters wanted to watch the fireworks in downtown Austin by the river. We went early so we could find a good spot to sit, so it was still daytime. We found one by the bridge, the one with the bats that fly out during sunset.

  


My youngest, she was 3 at the time, was thirsty so my ex took her to buy some refreshments. My oldest and I sat down kind of facing the bridge hoping we could see the bats before the fireworks started. It was already getting crowded and we could hear the usual stuff, people talking, kids playing etc. Then everything stopped and I notice a large shadow being cast on the ground. My daughter and I looked up and saw a huge triangle shaped black craft silently creeping above us.

We found one by the bridge, the one with the bats that fly out during sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My youngest, she was 3 at the time, was thirsty so my ex took her to buy some refreshments.

,Thetruthishere,"Hello this is my first post on reddit!! I’ve had to re write it about three times because every time I stop my text that I write also deletes its self so not sure if the spirit world wants me to post it but here we go...

One night about three years ago I was asleep with my boyfriend, well he wasn’t asleep otherwise he wouldn’t have experienced what had happened. Basically I sat up and asked my boyfriend why my dad was at the end of my bed... (my dad had been dead at least two years prior to this happening.) my boyfriend said he told me that ‘he wasnt’ 

Anyways apparently after that I just went back to sleep. I do not have any recollection of this happening even when he woke me after it happening I just didn’t believe him and went back to sleep. Which makes me quite guttered in a way because I would have loved to have seen my dad again. 

Anyways has anyone else had experiences like this? I’m 100 percent sure my boyfriend wouldn’t lie about something like this as he was quite shook up by it and said he couldn’t get to sleep.

,Thetruthishere,"I couldn't figure out how to crosspost [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/f4e87p/anyone_here_experienced_a_skyquake/) discussion to TTIH but it seems like something that you folks are discussing. 

Basically, I've had a series of dreams about what seem to be 'skyquakes' of the sonic boom variety. From browsing Reddit's other paranomal threads I've learned that these sorts of 'quakes' 'booms' or whatever you call em, also tend to happen before sightings of bigfoot, aliens and in so-called thin spaces. So I wonder if there is a link between the booms and the paranormal.

The fact that my experiences are dream-based might sound like they are wishy washy but, believe me, they are anything but. They're realistic to the point where I start questioning whether I might be seeing another person's experience, telepathically. But at the same time, they're also paranormal as in, unearthly.

Nothing was coming out of my mouth so I tried to scream...nothing. I quickly ran back to my bed under the covers and proceeded to close my eyes and freak out a bit. After I opened my eyes again I could speak. Parents woke up a bit later, I asked them if I woke them up with my screaming. They seemed confused so I disregarded it. I believe to this day that something otherworldly played with me as I felt very unusually lethargic and short of breath/conciousness even after waking up.

Before you ask, no it wasn't my ears I could hear everything around me.
My parents would have heard me even with the door closed as the bathroom is across the very narrow corridor from their room.


Encounter 2.
(Still in same apartment on the 15th floor like the last encounter. I live in a cheaper/old person downtown region of a small but very populated city.)

This must have been around a year ago or so can't exactly remember. It was a normal night for the most part, It was probably around 3 am. I could not for the life of me fall asleep that night. I kept tossing and turning but could not fall asleep, suddenly with a loud voice I hear: ""GET DOWN ON THE GROUND"" followed almost immediately by 3 gunshots. As soon as I hear this I jump up from my bed and look down though my window, surely enough I see the red and blue lights and 3 cop cars. Curious I start looking around at all the condos and shorter apartments to see if anyone else is watching, but I see absolutely nobody. I must have been looking for a solid minute until out of nowhere everything becomes silent and I see no lights. As soon as this happens I hear 3 loud and fast knocks at my door with an ominous white light around the door frame.
Somehow I manage to fall asleep, but the morning after I was terrified. Weirdest part is, I tried for the best part of a week after to check the news and police reports on a shooting incident, but no matter how hard I looked, I found absolutely nothing.

,Thetruthishere,"So, my friend just sent me these pictures (https://imgur.com/a/nIj2G5x) that he took with his phone a few hours ago (about 9:30 P.M.) in complete darkness. One was taken with flash, the other one without. He also didn't have something like night mode or anything similar turned on. I raised the brightness and lowered the contrast a bit on the dark picture, so you can see the room clearer.

As you can see, the wall in the dark picture reflects something that looks like a room, which is totally impossible because there is no room there to reflect. If there actually was a room that could be reflected, then why the fuck would the white wall be reflecting it and not the mirror? What's also weird is that dark and odd little stain on the reflection.

What freaks me out the most is, that the reflection isn't just a spot full of light, but a clearly recognizeable room.

As if this wasn't already scary enough, he claims to have had several sleep paralysis in this room. Does this maybe have anything in common?

What's going on here? I'm almost 100% certain that this is not a weird lighting mistake of the camera or something like that.

Thanks for any help!

,Thetruthishere,"Three different times now, I and in two cases others saw lights in the sky right after mentioning the possibility of something watching over us.

A friend and I were on our way to a mediation group. We were walking down a hill talking about the grandness of life and how there's gotta be life out in the universe too. It got to the point in the conversation where my friend said, if there is life out there and they were able to listen, they would definitely be listening right now because this conversation is lit. I was like yeah man, and kinda sighed as I looked up. Right then, a bright orange/red light appeared and disappeared as it quickly moved from left to right across the sky. My jaw dropped as he said holy fuck did you see that? I was like uh yeah man. After some thought I have tried to explain it in a few different ways. It was a cloudy night so a meteor seemed unlikely. A plane or helicopter travelling through the valley was another thought, but wouldn't explain why it wouldn't have appeared before or after. The similarities in the next two experiences are interesting. 

I'm sitting on the beach with a few friends looking up at the sky, having a similar conversation as before. Life is awesome, the universe is big, who are we to think that we're the only life in existence. A friend said, I bet there are beings out there thinking the exact same thing that we are right now, looking up into the same sky. In the moment after he said that, the same kind of orange/red light appeared and disappeared after moving from left to right horizontally. Again my jaw dropped and was like anyone else see that? No one else did and the conversation continued, as I recalled the last time this happened. It was a clear starry night this time, so the possibility of it being a meteor is more likely.

My girlfriend and I are sitting on the beach during the day, its a clear sky except for this huge ominous looking cloud near the horizon. She joked with me saying, you know some people think UFO's can disguise themselves as clouds. I replied, if that's true, that cloud is definitely one of them because just look at it. In the next moment, a red light slowly appeared in the cloud and shined brightly for a few seconds then faded away, as we said lol holy shit look at that, then it came back for a few seconds again and then disappeared. I figure it could have been some kind of lightening like phenomena, I think I've read of balls of light like that being formed in thunder clouds before, who knows. 

The thought in the back of my mind, maybe there is life out there listening to these different conversations and are flashing their lights or something to fuck with us lol.

,Thetruthishere,"There is a small handful of experiences in my life that I'm trying to understand and I want to share to see if anyone else has had similar things happen.

I sat down on the couch after a long day of snowboarding and zoned out for about a minute. In a moment, I realized how deep in thought I was and quickly snapped back to reality. In that moment, I watched a white swoosh in my vision drop down and pop into my forehead. My head kinda bumped back a little and then I was fully conscious in the room again, not lost in my thoughts. I didn't think it at the time, but now I figure that could have been my spirit flying back into my body after being away in thoughts somewhere...

Another time, I was lying in bed with my girlfriend staring into the back of her head. Suddenly, a similar white swoosh (as I describe it) dropped into the center of her head right as she began to readjust her position. She mumbled a little and then settled back down and continued sleeping.

I was dreaming one time when I suddenly realized it and quickly sat up in bed. I immediately did a double look of where my head was because I saw a ball of white light. When I looked back it wasn't there but realized what I had saw and that was an interesting start to the day.

There are a number of other times where I have seen this white light. It's not glowing or bright, but kinda a dull white or grey/silver. These experiences have really tripped me out. They've been on my mind a lot recently so I'd love to know if anyone else has had similar experiences or where I could learn more about this.

Edit: I'll share another one because why not. I was at a friends house and her adorable very wise looking dog came over and hopped on my lap. He looked my in the eyes with a very calm and sentient stare. Her owner, my friend, said to the dog ""oh hey buddy"" in a very high pitched babying kind of voice, as many do talking to their pets. The dog looked over at her and sighed, and I could kinda feel him thinking wow you're really going to talk to me like that, you know I can hear you. As he sighed, a white kinda push of energy kinda expelled from his head moving towards my friend.

,Thetruthishere,"This is something my sister experienced about a week ago which was similar to an experience a friend of hers had a month before. 

She was sleeping at her boyfriends house (which backs onto a mountain with a forest starting in his backyard) when she decided to go get herself some food from upstairs. Her boyfriend refused to go with her as he had school in the morning and it was already 1 in the morning. His room is in the basement so she went up the stairs to the kitchen, on the same level as the rest of his family’s bedrooms. Because she didn’t want to wake everyone else up, she just used her phone flashlight while she prepared herself bananas and hummus. While doing so, she heard what sounded like large dog foot steps (they DONT have any pets) going to the bathroom which she recognized as it was squeaky. The door opened and closed about three or four times before finally closing. Then the footsteps progressed down the hall in her direction to a closet door where the same thing happened, only this time the door was left open. She tried to brush it off as a family member and went back to chopping her banana, out of the corner of her eye she saw what appeared to be a very large black figure slowly lean its way around the hallway corner to look into the kitchen. She looked up and it was gone. The same thing happened again, only this time it’s neck (?) Stretched out longer to get a better look at her. She looked up again and caught a glimpse of something with white glowing eyes before it disappeared back around the corner. At this point she was freaked out and grabbed her knife,  she quickly went around that corner to turn on the light before gathering all her stuff and heading back downstairs... when she told her boyfriend in the morning, he told her that that closet door, is not just a closet door it’s an empty room with the attic door in the ceiling. They went in the room the next day and found that paint had been scratched off of the attic door and the floor was scratched beneath it.

A friend of hers had a similar incident a month or so earlier when he was taking a leak in the backyard.. he looked up to see a tall creature with what he described to be white glowing eyes and huge teeth standing amongst the trees.

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s really strange, is that where the shadow figure walked, there&amp;#39;s a loft and a TV in its place, so the shadow figure just walked straight through those objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directly after this experience, he left his room and slept on the couch downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

My grandmother passed away last October. I was particularly close to my grandmother growing up so her passing was very hard on me. I myself am a bit of a skeptic when in comes to anything in the paranormal realm. However, the experience I had still baffles me today and I cannot rationally explain what occurred. 

My parents were hosting a small bbq dinner and invited my grandfather over to spend some time with the family. I was the only person manning the grill that day and periodically I’d go outside and check the grill to make sure nothing was burning. After about 20 minutes from the last check I decide to go outside and check again except this time the grill was cold to the touch- I was the only person handling the grill and I made sure there was enough propane and that none of the connections were faulty. None of the gas knobs were moved either. I didn’t think too much of it and went back inside.
Inside, I told my grandfather about what just happened and he made a joke saying it was my grandmother messing with us. In that moment- specifically when he mentioned her name, all of the power went out in the house. Again, strange but we didn’t think too much of it. 
Later on that same night I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise originating from my night stand. I have a moderately heavy (8-10lbs) pink salt lamp that was knocked over on its own! It was out of reach from myself and my girlfriend as well, who I should mention was in the same bed as I and was also awakened by the noise. She rolls over and falls back asleep. It’s at this point I notice a fine silvery- white mist appear at my bed stand. I’m not sure how to explain this but somehow I felt a deep connection to that mist and knew in my heart of hearts that it was my grandmother visiting me. This mist proceeded to non- verbally (telepathically)communicate to me that I was loved immensely by it. It told me that it was my grandmother and to not be afraid, she told me not to mourn her loss so hard and to take care of my grandfather who was struggling to cope with her loss. She told me to spend as much time as I could with him because they would be reunited soon.  I woke up the next morning and tried to block it out mentally for the rest of the day. It wasn’t until later at work I started to cry seemingly out of nowhere and allowed myself to  feel my emotions that I realized what had taken place the day before. I still haven’t told my family in fear that they may not believe me or that it may trigger sadness.

I still get chills writing this because I know what I saw. I’ve had sleep paralysis before and am very familiar with the sensation- this was NOT sleep paralysis. Less than a year later my grandfather passes unexpectedly.

,Thetruthishere,"I've posted here before, and due to being housebound after an operation for the past few months, I've recently been spending a lot of time alone. It's been difficult, but all this time alone has afforded me a lot of thinking time; I've remembered some really wonderful memories and also some totally bizarre ones. After my previous post, i have started remembering so many incidences that occurred in my late teens/ early twenties. This is one of them.   


I used to spend a lot of time with my elder cousin and my friends exploring the countryside surrounding our town, drinking beers and just being young men up for adventures and killing time together. On this one occasion during a summer around 2009-2010, my friend Woody had a girlfriend over from Sweden who brought along a female friend of hers. We all went to the pub on the edge of town, drank many beers and, as it was summer, left while it was still light outside. We decided to head back to my cousin's house, pick up some more beers, smokes and acoustic guitars and head out to the fields to continue hanging out and making the most of the warm summer night. There were 6 of us present; Woody, Billy, my elder cousin Aidan, the two ladies Selene and her friend (can't recall her name) and I. We headed under the rail bridge, climbed the gate to the field and settled about halfway across with a clear view on all sides of us of the surrounding area. Not far off was a small power relay station, and beyond that the field continued towards woodlands.   


We started up a campfire and the beers were flowing. It was a lovely summer night where the sky was a deep, dark blue and the stars and moon shone down on us, illuminating the ground. We amused ourselves making songs with ridiculous lyrics and done the usual thing of trading amusing swear words and sayings with our Swedish friends. After a while, everyone was spread out in a circle around the fire and we were talking at a low volume. Out of nowhere, a man walked right past our group, to which my cousin said ""HOLY FUCK...shit that dude made me jump!"" as he choked on his beer and we all laughed as he had made all of us jump with his reaction. We were laughing at the situation for no more than 10 seconds when Woody cut in with ""Whoa...where the fuck did he go...?!"" as he looked around in the direction the man had walked.   


The man was nowhere to be seen.  


May i add that there really was no way this guy could have left the field so quickly without us hearing him climb the gate at the very least or seeing him. It was too much of a distance from where we were sat around the fire to leave that field in that amount of time. We all stood up and were scanning the area around us, all in total disbelief that the man could have vanished. I asked the others if they saw what he was wearing, as all i could remember was he seemed to be wearing a dark grey hoody with the hood up and i didn't see his face. Everyone confirmed the dark grey hoody, but not one of us saw the man's face, even though he almost walked right over where my cousin was sprawled out, at most a metre or so from him. We also confirmed that none of us heard or saw the man coming toward our group even though we were in the middle of a field with clear visibility for miles, and we would have definitely heard someone walking toward us across the grass at the pace the man was travelling.   


We decided to put the fire out and leave as this spooked all of us because it just made no sense at all. I never saw Selene or her friend again, unfortunately, so i couldn't ask them if they remembered this, but i know my cousin and i would often talk about this, and both Billy and Woody remember it to this day.

,Thetruthishere,"Posting from mobile so obligatory appology.

First time poster here and figured I could share one of the many experiences I have had with things I couldnt explain.

We moved a lot when I was growing up, all over the country and in places which ranged from young to old and lots of history.  Lived in homes with multiple floors, condemned trailer houses with no electricity or running water, everything in between.  I tell you that to tell you this: I am not unaccustomed with the unfamiliar.  My childhood was split between so many homes of of such a wide variety that I never had the chance to develop a fear of the unknown, the sounds and feels of a new place have never scared me until one time.

We had moved to this brick and Adobe house in eastern New Mexico, I was about 11 or 12, and lived there for about a week when I noticed a peculiar trend.  The pantry door would rattle at the same time every night like clockwork.  Honestly it sounded like someone trying, but failing, to open the door.

My bedroom shared a wall with the kitchen so I was essentially the only one in the house that heard it, but it drove me nuts once I noticed it.  I asked my dad about it and he said how it was probably the air con and pressure differentials. That sort of thing.  I dodnt think anything of it but that night I shut the air con off, set a timer, and waited.  The door rattled again, like clockwork.  It carried on for about half an hour or so then stopped and I went to sleep knowing it wasnt the air conditioning. 

The next day I brought this to my dad who was understandably upset that I had shut off the AC and stayed up so late, but he was understanding of my need to know.  His next theory was vibration from nearby traffic or a nearby railroad could be reaching some kind of resonance in that door frame.  He was satisfied and sent me on my way.  I was not satisfied.

I couldnt isolate traffic and the railroad because I cant control those things.  But I figured I would do another test.  That night rolled around and I shut the AC off, then opened my bedroom window and listened for the train.  I knew it couldnt be traffic, too regular, but the train tracks were relatively close and I knew from past experience I would be able to hear the train.

The door....rattled.


I listened for it to stop, reset the AC, and closed my window.  This time I did not tell my dad.


Thw next night I decided a more...aggressive approach was called for.  Before I continue I should point out something about this house.  Like so many older homes, it had an ever so slight lean.  The sort of lean where if a door is not latched, it will slowly move further open or closed depending on its position relative to this unfortunate axis.  The pantry door, notably, was positioned such that if it werent latched fully, it would slowly open, rather than close. 

So I set an alarm and waited till it was nearly time for the rattle to start.  I went into the kitchen, turned on all the lights, opened the pantry door, and sat cross legged on the floor to wait.  Sure enough, the moment came.

The pantry door opened wider than it normally would have in a sharp jerking motion, then it slammed hard enough to rattle the shelves and it rattled harder than it had ever done before.  It was like someone trying to get out of a locked room!  I sat there in awe, watching the spectacle as my parents came up to see what the ruckus was, seeing the door and everything. 

I dont quite remember my parents reactions, it was a whole lot of me being swept up and firmly guided to my parents bedroom where I was shortly joined by my sister and both parents.  Over the next couple of days dad tried replacing the hinges, adding a lock, and eventually just taking the door off altogether.

Anyway, Here is some backstory:
My brother’s Counsler were having a little toss around, playing rough, when my brother bonked his head on the side of a Music Tower (which plays music to wake us up). My brother’s friends said that he was foaming out of the mouth for a little bit, as though he was having a seizure. He went to the nurses office, where he was in a bed. (Even though me and brother are usually fighting, we have peaceful times). I told him to get well and I walked away. 

It was at night and the time for some music. I sat near a couple of friends. We were listening to music, and I don’t know what it was, but the energy was POWERFUL, to the point where people were crying, cuddling, it felt like the world stopped, and God was watching us.
It came down to walking to the cross and sticking notes to the side. I walk up, right up to the cross, and wrote my brother’s name down and pinned it. I sat down with one of my friends who was crying. I sat down next to her, helping her out, when I notice my brother walking into the building. 
That’s when I bursted into tears and hugged my friend real nice. I said “God is good... God is good”. Keep in mind, my brother was in the bed for at least 4-5 hours since he came back.

Every night, I usually dream. Some are more vivid and lucid than others. Some I can remember certain details for days afterward. However, my dreams are mostly fantastical and wild. I know that they're dreams when I'm in them and dream logic applies to everything - except for one I had last night. 

I've never had a dream that was exceptionally realistic - where dream logic didn't apply at all, and that I could be watching real people having real conversations in a true to life world without any of those classic LSD-like effects. But last night I dreamt about a little girl in the late 1700s/early 1800s America. She was kidnapped by her father who then ran off with her and was both sexually and physically abusive toward her. He had kept her hidden in an abandoned house, but one day a band of Native Americans spotted him abusing her and they killed him and ended up taking her with them. I woke up after the rescue. 

Now, I've left out a lot of detail - but the odd thing about this dream was that it felt *so real*. Incredibly so - as though I was watching a full scene captured in time. I also don't know anything about 17/1800s clothing or houses. I haven't seen a western in a very long time, or any movies related to the time period. I don't really know much about Native culture - but all these things were crystal clear in my dream.

,Thetruthishere,"Here's what's been going on the last few days:

I'd been playing the Ouija board alone. Not smart, I know, but I only have one friend and he's impossible to catch at home. I'd convinced my mom to play at one point, and we contacted my grandpa, but she was spooked out over the planchette moving, so I didn't ask again.

Once when I messed with the board alone, I encountered a spirit that refused to give me a name. Every time I asked its name, it told me to go away. And I was repeatedly told to turn back during different sessions, and the spirits kept mentioning ""him"" but refused to elaborate on who him was. Heck, even my grandpa mentioned ""him"".

Looking back, I think they were trying to warn me. 

Now, I wasn't sure if the planchette was moving because of spirits or if I was subconsciously moving it, so I decided instead of just putting my fingers on the planchette I would make a point out of barely touching it. I even tried to purposely move it while I was so lightly touching it, and I couldn't unless I applied more pressure. So I figured it would be safe to say if anything happened it wouldn't be me moving it.

So I started asking my questions, mostly just different variations of ""is anybody here?"" For a few minutes nothing happened. Then the planchette started to move.

I have felt it move before, but this time was different, maybe because of the precautions I'd taken to make sure I wouldn't be doing it subconsciously. I just watched it move, muttering, ""I know I'm not doing this, I'm barely even touching it."" I was genuinely spooked out.

This is the entire conversation I had with the spirit, from the moment the planchette started to move:

""Is there anyone here?"" I asked.

The planchette started moving slowly, and I was spooked because I knew I couldn't be doing it with how lightly I'm touching it. Also, something just felt different this time. I don't know how to explain it. It felt like something was controlling the planchette, and I was just along for the ride.

Looking back on it, I think even the air in the room felt heavier.

The planchette started spelling out: f-u-c-k-y-o

At this point one of my fingers accidentally fell off the planchette and I quickly put it back.

""Are you still here?"" I asked.

The planchette moved to yes.

""What's your name?""

The planchette moved to Z, and I started thinking, oh no, don't tell me what I think you're about to tell me.

Z-O

At this point something touched my leg. I was alone in the room, there aren't even animals in there, but in my peripheral vision I saw a flash of something black and then felt something touch my leg.

I jumped and looked to my side, but there was nothing there that could've touched me.

""What the fuck was that?"" I muttered to myself. ""What just touched me?""

I was officially freaked out. I'd never had something touch me during a ouija session before. Not only that, I saw something. 

You ever see a shadow move out of the corner of your eye, and when you look, there's nothing there? That's kind of like what I saw. Except it was accompanied by something touching me in an empty room.

Yeah, so I was officially freaked out now.

I looked back at the board, and saw the planchette moving back towards Z.

At this point, I quickly forced the planchette to goodbye, put the board up in ten seconds flat, and ran out of the room. I did have enough presence of mind to store the planchette separately from the board, so that's a plus.

I ran outside and video called my friend Kylie, who's a very spiritual person, and told her what happened. She advised me to put some quartz crystal on the board while it wasn't being used, and to put quartz on the corners of the board next time I use it, to cleanse the negative energy. So that's what I did. I left her on video chat while I put the crystal on the board, and she said she could sense some residue in the room.

Super.

Later that night, I asked for a clairvoyant reading in a Facebook group I'm in for free psychic readings. This is what the psychic said:

""You have death around you, sudden death, but the possibility is always there.
There is also a warning to you. Curiosity has led you to some dark energy, this energy is harmful. I feel like you've discovered this, like events are happening because you initiated them. I don't think you're dark inside, you're still emitting light, but the darkness could engulf you if you keep going. It's all about intentions.""

Real cheerful, right?

I have to admit, it's eerie how spot on she was. I've gotten readings before, but that one was the most accurate yet.

I am obviously freaked out over this whole thing. I hadn't even been thinking about Zozo. I'd never encountered him before, and most of the stories I have read about him seem elaborated, so I figured he wasn't as scary as everyone said. But nothing could've prepared me for the very real fear I felt when the board started to spell out Zozo, or when I felt something touch me. How do you explain that? I was alone in that room.

I've been keeping a record of any other signs that Zozo might still be around. I smudged the room and the board with white sage, and when I did I felt cold and the whole time I had a bad feeling. Some other things I've noticed: my dog has been whining and keeps looking in the direction of the board, and my phone has been acting up. At one point, it randomly started playing music and I can't figure out why. It wasn't even music I had on my phone, it was just random guitar strumming. 

I plan to use the board when I get home today to see if Zozo is still hanging around. I haven't even been back in that room since I cleansed it, but eventually I'm going to have to check. I'm hoping that I closed the board fast enough to prevent him from getting attached. Not much has happened yet, and I'm hoping it will stay that way.

Update 1: Clothes I have gotten rid of have somehow ended up under the bed. At first I thought my puppy dragged them under there (she likes stealing clothes), but then I found a pink dress under the bed that I know for a fact I put in a box to be sold.

I had to shine a flashlight under the bed so I could see the clothes under there. At one point I set the light on the floor while I put something up, and when I turned around the light was gone. I got down to look, and it was halfway under the bed. How did that happen? I only had my back turned for five seconds. 

I guess I should explain why I was looking under the bed in the first place. Me and my mom are in a bad situation right now. We have no electricity or running water, and we're basically living in what used to be a storage shack. Our old house, which is on the same property, is being torn down, but there's one room that's still intact, and that's where I'm keeping the board.

The reason I was looking under the bed is because one of my dogs is on a tether, and we keep her inside when we're not there. We never take her off the tether because if we took her off outside she'd run onto the road, and if we took her off inside she'd probably try to kill the cat. Anyway, she likes to go under the bed, and sometimes she manages to get her tether tangled up around the bed frame. I have no idea how she does it, but she did that today, so I had to untangle her, which is how I discovered the clothes.

The thing is, we had had to untangle her just a couple days ago, and there were no clothes under the bed then.

I can't say for certainty if this is connected to Zozo, but it certainly is weird, and I'm trying to write down anything weird that happens in case it's connected. 

Update 2: 
I had to rewrite this because it somehow got deleted. I'm not sure how that happened, but anyway here's what happened next. 

So I knew I had to check the board and see if Zozo was still hanging around, but I didn't want to do it alone. I tried to see if Kylie or another one of my online friends could be on video chat with me while I did it, but they were both busy. So I had to do it alone.

I placed quartz crystals on each corner of the board, lit a candle, and sat down on the floor. Nervously I placed my fingers on the planchette and asked, ""Is anybody here?""

Nothing happened at first, so I kept asking if there were any spirits with me. Finally the planchette started moving towards M.
I was confused at first. Then it went to A, then back over to M, then A again.

For those of you who don't know, Mama is another name Zozo likes to use.

I was freaked out, but I asked, ""What do you want with me?""

The planchette swooped over to No, which confused me. Then it went over to Yes, then down to the corner below, then over to the next corner.

I looked it up, and apparently when the planchette moves to all four corners it means you have contacted an evil spirit. 

Joy.

I was starting to panic at this point, so I tried to say Goodbye. The planchette moved to No. At this point, it was going very fast.

""What do you want with me?"" I asked again. 

The planchette spelled out, ""AZAZAZAZAZAZ.""

Yay. Another one of Zozo's names.

I couldn't take it anymore, and I forced the planchette to goodbye. When I did, the planchette flipped over. I'm not sure what to think of that. I've heard that if the planchette falls off the board it means the spirit escaped, but the planchette was still on the board. It was just upside down. I suppose I could've accidentally done it with the force I used to move the planchette to Goodbye, but I can't be sure.

Another thing: when the planchette moved to the bottom corners, one of the plastic glide feet fell off the board, though the rest of the planchette was still on the board. I am not sure if this is a bad thing or not, but I'm going to find out.

I'm seriously freaked out and scared. I was hoping he'd be gone. The crystals and the sage didn't do a thing. I'm not sure what I should do now, and I'm scared of what might happen next.

Update 3: The following is a transcript of a text conversation between me and my friend, John, who is kind of an expert on these things. After telling him about the second ouija session with Zozo, this is what he had to say.

John: Holy fuck!

Me: Yeah...

Me: I would've called you but I knew your phone wasn't charged.

John: Hugs

John: And i was with family

Me: I really would've preferred having someone on video chat while I was dealing with that

John: No shit.

John: Wish you could have waited.

Me: I had wanted Kylie because she would've been able to sense anything off.

John: Nods

John: Lol thanks 😉 feel like im chopped liver now lol

Me: I have nothing going on tomorrow, and I really need to know if he's still attached to the board or not. Would tomorrow be good to video chat?

Me: I could do it when I get home tonight, but I really don't want to go near the board at night alone.

John: No dont and its around but not attached

John: The door IS closed

Me: How can you tell?

Me: It's still around but it isn't attached? To me or the board?

John: Either. But it isnt on our side of tte veil. You trapped it

John: But it’s around not happy

Me: I trapped it? How the hell did I do that?

John: When you said goodbye. It was trying to break free and you slammed the door on its foot. Metaphorically speaking

Me: The AZAZ thing

Me: So that's why he likes to constantly spell out his name?

Me: So he can break out?

John: Nope

John: It will attempt to have you not shut the portal when you use the board next. So it could be free, but right now its stewing

Me: How would it do that?

John: Scare you into distraction so you wont say goodbye. Or muck up saying goodbye

Me: Muck up saying Goodbye? How can you do that?

John: As long as you close/say goodbye and focus seeing any portals

Me: Anything else I should look out for?

John: It will try to scare you and try to have you, let it in. Like a vampire

Me: Come again?

John: Where did I lose you at?

Me: Letting it in like a vampire? Vampires need invitation to go in a house.

John: Yep and demons are known to trick people into letting them into a person/persons life

Me: Trick how? I want to know what I should watch out for.

John: Basically dont invite anything into you.

Me: Okay

John: And they love to impersonate

Me: I've read Zozo is a fan of impersonation

John: All demons are with the ouija board 

Me: So the question is, did me and mom actually contact my grandpa the other night? Is there a way to tell the difference?

John: Yea but its hard to explain. You would know, gut feeling and everything tells me this time you did

Me: Did contact my grandpa?

Me: After me and my mom finished, I contacted my grandpa again alone, and he gave me a warning. I can't remember exactly what he said, but I know he mentioned a ""him"".

John: Yea you did

Me: The spirits I talked to Saturday also mentioned a ""him"" and told me to go away, stop, turn back.

Me: Is there any way to banish him?

John: Let me work on that.

Me: Okay

Update 4: I sent pictures of the Ouija board and the room it's in to Kylie. She said the picture of the board made her want to throw up.

Joy.

Also, I did a tarot reading for myself. In the past position, I drew the five of Swords reversed. For present, I drew nine of Pentacles reversed. When I went to draw the future card, two cards jumped out of the deck. I took that as a sign and put them both down for future: the ten of wands reversed and The Moon.

I'm still a beginner tarot reader, so I often have to look up the meanings of the cards. It isn't exactly easy to memorize the meanings of seventy something cards. Anyway, here's the meanings of the cards in my reading.

Five of Swords reversed: though sometimes a good omen, it can also signify an escalation in violence, conflict, and power struggles. 

Nine of Pentacles reversed: lack of independence, confidence, freedom, security, or stability.

Ten of Wands reversed: having too much responsibility, stress, a cross that is too heavy to bear

The Moon: illusion, fear, anxiety, a difficult period or time when things are not as they seem.

I asked someone who's more experienced than I am, and they drew this meaning from the cards:

All is not what it seems. Keep your wits about you and do not divulge anything to those you deem a threat. An unknown event is happening which involves trickery and you are subconciously trying to find your way out of it. You also have lost a little of your independence but feeling less burdened as of late.

I'm currently trying to decide what my next move should be. Ideally, I would like to find a way to banish Zozo from the board. There's a couple spells I might be able to try. I'm also wondering if he will show up if I don't play alone, but I'm not sure who I can play with. Most of my friends live in different states, so there's only about three people I can ask: my mom, my friend Will, and my cousin Chris.

The last time I played the ouija board with Will, he tried to scare me by moving the planchette. Even if I don't tell him about Zozo, he will still probably move the planchette himself to scare me. Also, Will is damn near impossible to catch at home.

Chris...I'm not sure if Chris would even believe me, and I'm not sure if I can trust him not to move the planchette. I've never played with Chris before, so I don't know what he will do.

As for my mom, I really do not want her anywhere near a demon. My mom is a Christian, and she told me when she agreed to play to try to contact my grandpa she did not want to talk to any demons. And I don't want her talking to any demons either. 

So right now I'm not sure how I should proceed. Most of the spells I know for dealing with an evil spirits are for trapping it in an inanimate object or are exorcism spells. No one is possessed, so I don't need an exorcism, and it's already trapped in the ouija board. What I need is something to banish it from the board.

I'm going to continue to think about this and try to decide my next move. I don't want this thing around, and I'm going to find some way to get rid of it.


Update 5: Right now I am mostly just trying to protect myself. I made a protection charm bag earlier and have put it on a chain so I can wear it as a necklace. I've prayed to my patron deity and other gods I honor for protection, and I cleansed the room and the board again with white sage. I should note that I had difficulties getting the sage to burn, and when I went to smudge the board I actually had to relight it. The air in that room feels very heavy and oppressive.

I'm scared to touch the board again, at least alone. Until either I can find someone to play with or one of my friends is able to video chat, I'm going to leave it alone. I still want to know if he will only show up if I'm alone, and I'm still looking for a way to banish him from the board completely. 

I did write down one of the exorcism spells I found, which will allow me to imprison him in an inanimate object. But as I said, it's an exorcism spell; it's meant to be used to repel a demon from its victim's body and then trap it in an object. It's more of a worse case scenario spell right now. 

I'm also going to look through all my protection spells I've written down to see what would be the best one for me to use in this situation. 

If anyone has any advice, I'd be happy to hear it.

Update 6: I had a dream last night about the ouija board. I can't remember exactly what it was though.

I remembered something one of the spirits I talked to Saturday had said. It was the spirit who wouldn't tell me its name. It repeatedly told me to turn back, and then it spelled out, ""Get him.""

Very cryptic and foreboding. 

Also, in a twist of irony, I've found two posts on Facebook today ranting about ouija boards.

I commented on one of the posts about the irony of it, and told her I had contacted something malicious that was still hanging around. She told me to message her, so that's what I'm doing right now. With any luck, she can help me with this.

The first thing she asked was if it had windows. I said yes. She asked if they could be opened. I didn't know. I'd never tried. So I went to the room and tried. I was able to open them.

She told me to sage everything right now, and to put a salt circle around the board so it can't use it as a tether anymore. She said the windows open should make the energies disperse with the sage.

The first thing I did was nearly empty the sea salt pouring a circle around the board. I was very careful to make sure there weren't any breaks in the salt. I've seen Supernatural enough times to know how bad that would be.

Once that was done, I lit the sage and cleansed the room, repeating, ""You are not welcome here. Get out. In the name of the gods, begone. I don't want you here. Get out.""

Nothing seemed to go wrong. The only way I'll know for sure is if I use the board. When I do, it's staying in the salt circle. 

Update 7: I finally found someone I could video call to test the board again. I called my friend Rene and asked her if she could please stay on while I tested the board to see if Zozo was still hanging around and if he would show up if I wasn't alone. She agreed, and even got her own ouija board out so that technically I wouldn't be playing alone.

So I took the board out of the box, left the board in the salt circle, put the quartz crystals on the corners, and started asking questions.

It wasn't as scary talking to it with someone else there, even if it was over the phone. So here's what happened:

I asked if anyone was there several times before it started moving. It moved to Goodbye. Basically, it tried to blow us off.

Rene said something, and I asked if it didn't want to talk to me with Rene there. The planchette moved to No. Then it started spelling out its name.

Rene asked if it could hear her, and it said yes.

Then it started moving to the four corners. Rene told me not to let it move to the last corner, and I quickly stopped it, nearly flipping the planchette over when I did.

Then it started moving between the letters H and A repeatedly. Basically, it was laughing at us. I told it to stop, and it said no. Then it moved to the Z, then the O, then back and forth between the two. ZOZOZOZOZOZO.

""We know what your freaking name is!"" I said. I felt a lot braver with Rene watching everything. 

The planchette spelled out, ""b-i-t-c-h.""

""It called me a bitch,"" I told Rene, offended.

""Rude,"" she said.

The planchette was moving again. It moved to N, then all the way past the M to a blank area, then the A. I have no idea what it was doing and I am still confused about that. Then it moved downwards to the number zero, then moved over to nine.

At that point, I said goodbye and put the board up.

So the thing's still hanging around. It didn't seem to want to talk to me originally with Rene there, since it tried to say goodbye, but since we didn't let it it talked to us. It wasn't as scary since I wasn't alone, and Rene has a way of making everything seem hilarious. Still, I feel anxious.

A few more things of note, that might have nothing to do with Zozo but I'm still going to mention in case they do: After I said goodbye, I went back to my house and as soon as I walked in my puppy started barking. She's never done that before, so it seems very weird.

Also, I started shaking uncontrollably, and Mom complained about making her bed shake because I was leaning against it. I'm not sure what that's about either.

If anything else happens, I'll let you know.

Update 8: So I decided to try automatic writing. I'd heard some people contacted Zozo through automatic writing, and I wanted to see what happened. 

Well...I didn't get Zozo. I think I got Loki, my patron god.

It's not even in my handwriting. But I was just concentrating, having never done this before, and then the next thing I knew I was staring at words written in handwriting that isn't my own. This is what was on the paper. 

""Don't. Do not give it more power over you."" This was followed by three Nordic runes, Ansuz, Ehwaz, and Hagalaz, and then the words, ""Let me take care of this.""

I looked it up. Ansuz means ""communication,"" Ehwaz means ""horse,"" and Hagalaz means ""wrath."" So basically Loki told me to watch out and he's threatening his wrath.

In Asatru there's this thing called horsing, where a god temporarily takes you over, and I think Loki just did that to warn me not to use automatic writing to contact Zozo.

One thing's for sure: I wouldn't want to be Zozo if Loki unleashes his wrath.

Update 9: So there is water all around the ouija board and the salt circle, and there isn't water anywhere else in the room. It didn't rain last night. I have no idea how it got there. Anyone got an explanation?

Update 10: The water is still there. Also, the window in my house keeps getting cracked open. My dog has somehow gotten off her tether twice in the last two days, and I just noticed a box of herbs is on the floor, and I'm pretty sure I left it on the table.

Update 11: I have had a fucking terrible day. Came home from the laundromat and my dog got tangled up under the bed again, and we literally had to tear the bed apart to free her. Then my cat got out, went under the house, and is still refusing to come out.

On the Zozo side of things, I lit a white sage scented candle, put it on the board, and told it it needed to get out. The candle flame danced erratically the whole time it was lit.

Also, I received my emf detector today. I have gotten absolutely nothing in the room the ouija board is in, but I did get one random bleep in my house.

I finally talked to Will about what was going on. Unless his plans change, he's probably going to take me to the Catholic church Sunday to see about getting holy water to dispose of the board.

Any tips on how to blend in in a Catholic church?

Update 12: I sent a picture of the board with the water around it to the same person who told me to put salt around the board. She immediately told me to burn the board. She said it was trying to dissolve the salt, and if that happened worse things would come.

I can't destroy the board until I have holy water, so I have at least three more days of this, assuming Will's plans don't change.

Joy.

Also, I was trying to text something, and I accidentally typed out Zaza, even though I wasn't going anywhere near the Z when I was typing.

I have a very bad feeling about these next few days.

Update 13:
There is still water around the board today, but the salt circle is still intact. However, when I went in that room I immediately noticed a temperature drop. That room is colder than anywhere else on my property. It's a pretty warm day for February. Also, that room seems darker than usual. I mean, there's no electricity, so it's always pretty dark, but there are windows so the sun always shines through and lights it up pretty well. The air also very very heavy and oppressive. 

I took the emf detector in there. At first, I didn't get any signal. So I said, ""If you're here, can you make the emf beep?""

Silence. Then, one single beep from the emf.

I looked at it in surprise, not really expecting anything to happen. ""Can you do it again?"" I asked.

Nothing happened. I asked several more times for it to make the emf beep again, but nothing happened again. I eventually gave up, put down some more salt, and left.

Update 14: I'm not entirely sure that this is Zozo related, but I feel like it is because ever since I first contacted the damn thing my animals have been acting crazy and keep almost getting themselves killed.

My dog Butterball's somehow got off her tether twice. My other dog, Lucy, not only got off her tether but out of her collar. They have trashed the house multiple times while we were gone. Butterball nearly killed herself getting tangled up under the bed. A hole in the floor allowed the cat to get out and under the house (but we did get her back in last night), and before she got out the window somehow got cracked open twice.

Then today, Butterball got stuck under the house. She crawled into a hole we had dug when we were trying to get the cat out, got stuck, and here's the weird part-time hole was filled up when we found her under the house, and there were bits of trash blocking her way too, trash that wasn't anywhere near the house.

While we were digging her out, both me and my mom smelled the most awful smell. It was like a sewage.

I can't say for certain that this has anything to do with Zozo, but the fact all this is happening while this demon thing is going on makes me suspicious. And then there was that smell...

Thoughts?

Update 15: I looked up a list of signs of demonic attachment. I think I'm still in the infestation stage, judging from what I found.

I talked to John about the weird things that have been happening with the animals. He thinks it may be possible I'm dealing with more than one entity. Maybe Zozo called for backup because he's still trapped. When he said this, I immediately thought of the spirit I talked to that wouldn't tell me its name and said to ""get him.""

Things are getting worse. I need help. If there's more than one spirit, getting rid of the board probably won't help. If getting rid of the board doesn't work, I'm not sure what to do next.

Update 16: I went in there this morning to test the spirit box and nothing happened. Not only that, but the room felt normal. It wasn't any colder than normal, it didn't seem darker, and the air wasn't oppressive. I didn't sense anything off.

What the hell? Is it gone? Why would it just leave?

Update 17: I talked to John. He and Loki are apparently responsible for this. Here's a transcript of our conversation. 

Me: Did Loki do something? It is suspiciously normal in that room. It's not cold, not dark, the air isn't oppressive, the water seems to have dried up...

John: He did

Me: What did he do?

John: I dont feel Zozo around and your puppers should be back to normal

John: Considering the dreams I had...

Me: What happened?

John: We astrally fought the demons

Me: Oh...

John: He definitely tapped into my anger though

John: Holy hells im sooo angry still

Me: ...

John: Well more i am very aware now how angry i am

John: I will be fine later

John: But yea im seeing how treuly angry i am and he used it to power boost us

Me: So it's over now?

John: It's done.

So it looks like it's over. I've put the ouija board in the garage and am going to sell it as soon as I can. It can be someone else's problem.

Loki has been given the rest of my Valentine candy as a thank you offering. I am so relieved and my heart feels lighter.

If activity ever starts up again, and I think it's related to all of this, I will post here. But I think it's over now. I can relax now.",t2_4rzvjv97,False,,0,False,Bad Ouija Board Experience (Ongoing),[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_f22via,False,dark,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,,1581782834.0,,[],{},,True,,1581423042.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been going on the last few days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been playing the Ouija board alone. Not smart, I know, but I only have one friend and he&amp;#39;s impossible to catch at home. I&amp;#39;d convinced my mom to play at one point, and we contacted my grandpa, but she was spooked out over the planchette moving, so I didn&amp;#39;t ask again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once when I messed with the board alone, I encountered a spirit that refused to give me a name. Every time I asked its name, it told me to go away. And I was repeatedly told to turn back during different sessions, and the spirits kept mentioning &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; but refused to elaborate on who him was. Heck, even my grandpa mentioned &amp;quot;him&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I think they were trying to warn me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if the planchette was moving because of spirits or if I was subconsciously moving it, so I decided instead of just putting my fingers on the planchette I would make a point out of barely touching it. I even tried to purposely move it while I was so lightly touching it, and I couldn&amp;#39;t unless I applied more pressure. So I figured it would be safe to say if anything happened it wouldn&amp;#39;t be me moving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started asking my questions, mostly just different variations of &amp;quot;is anybody here?&amp;quot; For a few minutes nothing happened. Then the planchette started to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have felt it move before, but this time was different, maybe because of the precautions I&amp;#39;d taken to make sure I wouldn&amp;#39;t be doing it subconsciously. I just watched it move, muttering, &amp;quot;I know I&amp;#39;m not doing this, I&amp;#39;m barely even touching it.&amp;quot; I was genuinely spooked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the entire conversation I had with the spirit, from the moment the planchette started to move:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is there anyone here?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette started moving slowly, and I was spooked because I knew I couldn&amp;#39;t be doing it with how lightly I&amp;#39;m touching it. Also, something just felt different this time. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it. It felt like something was controlling the planchette, and I was just along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it, I think even the air in the room felt heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette started spelling out: f-u-c-k-y-o&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point one of my fingers accidentally fell off the planchette and I quickly put it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you still here?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette moved to yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your name?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette moved to Z, and I started thinking, oh no, don&amp;#39;t tell me what I think you&amp;#39;re about to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z-O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point something touched my leg. I was alone in the room, there aren&amp;#39;t even animals in there, but in my peripheral vision I saw a flash of something black and then felt something touch my leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jumped and looked to my side, but there was nothing there that could&amp;#39;ve touched me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck was that?&amp;quot; I muttered to myself. &amp;quot;What just touched me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was officially freaked out. I&amp;#39;d never had something touch me during a ouija session before. Not only that, I saw something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You ever see a shadow move out of the corner of your eye, and when you look, there&amp;#39;s nothing there? That&amp;#39;s kind of like what I saw. Except it was accompanied by something touching me in an empty room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so I was officially freaked out now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked back at the board, and saw the planchette moving back towards Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I quickly forced the planchette to goodbye, put the board up in ten seconds flat, and ran out of the room. I did have enough presence of mind to store the planchette separately from the board, so that&amp;#39;s a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran outside and video called my friend Kylie, who&amp;#39;s a very spiritual person, and told her what happened. She advised me to put some quartz crystal on the board while it wasn&amp;#39;t being used, and to put quartz on the corners of the board next time I use it, to cleanse the negative energy. So that&amp;#39;s what I did. I left her on video chat while I put the crystal on the board, and she said she could sense some residue in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night, I asked for a clairvoyant reading in a Facebook group I&amp;#39;m in for free psychic readings. This is what the psychic said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have death around you, sudden death, but the possibility is always there.
There is also a warning to you. Curiosity has led you to some dark energy, this energy is harmful. I feel like you&amp;#39;ve discovered this, like events are happening because you initiated them. I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re dark inside, you&amp;#39;re still emitting light, but the darkness could engulf you if you keep going. It&amp;#39;s all about intentions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real cheerful, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, it&amp;#39;s eerie how spot on she was. I&amp;#39;ve gotten readings before, but that one was the most accurate yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am obviously freaked out over this whole thing. I hadn&amp;#39;t even been thinking about Zozo. I&amp;#39;d never encountered him before, and most of the stories I have read about him seem elaborated, so I figured he wasn&amp;#39;t as scary as everyone said. But nothing could&amp;#39;ve prepared me for the very real fear I felt when the board started to spell out Zozo, or when I felt something touch me. How do you explain that? I was alone in that room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been keeping a record of any other signs that Zozo might still be around. I smudged the room and the board with white sage, and when I did I felt cold and the whole time I had a bad feeling. Some other things I&amp;#39;ve noticed: my dog has been whining and keeps looking in the direction of the board, and my phone has been acting up. At one point, it randomly started playing music and I can&amp;#39;t figure out why. It wasn&amp;#39;t even music I had on my phone, it was just random guitar strumming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to use the board when I get home today to see if Zozo is still hanging around. I haven&amp;#39;t even been back in that room since I cleansed it, but eventually I&amp;#39;m going to have to check. I&amp;#39;m hoping that I closed the board fast enough to prevent him from getting attached. Not much has happened yet, and I&amp;#39;m hoping it will stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: Clothes I have gotten rid of have somehow ended up under the bed. At first I thought my puppy dragged them under there (she likes stealing clothes), but then I found a pink dress under the bed that I know for a fact I put in a box to be sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to shine a flashlight under the bed so I could see the clothes under there. At one point I set the light on the floor while I put something up, and when I turned around the light was gone. I got down to look, and it was halfway under the bed. How did that happen? I only had my back turned for five seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I should explain why I was looking under the bed in the first place. Me and my mom are in a bad situation right now. We have no electricity or running water, and we&amp;#39;re basically living in what used to be a storage shack. Our old house, which is on the same property, is being torn down, but there&amp;#39;s one room that&amp;#39;s still intact, and that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m keeping the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I was looking under the bed is because one of my dogs is on a tether, and we keep her inside when we&amp;#39;re not there. We never take her off the tether because if we took her off outside she&amp;#39;d run onto the road, and if we took her off inside she&amp;#39;d probably try to kill the cat. Anyway, she likes to go under the bed, and sometimes she manages to get her tether tangled up around the bed frame. I have no idea how she does it, but she did that today, so I had to untangle her, which is how I discovered the clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, we had had to untangle her just a couple days ago, and there were no clothes under the bed then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say for certainty if this is connected to Zozo, but it certainly is weird, and I&amp;#39;m trying to write down anything weird that happens in case it&amp;#39;s connected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2: 
I had to rewrite this because it somehow got deleted. I&amp;#39;m not sure how that happened, but anyway here&amp;#39;s what happened next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I knew I had to check the board and see if Zozo was still hanging around, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to do it alone. I tried to see if Kylie or another one of my online friends could be on video chat with me while I did it, but they were both busy. So I had to do it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I placed quartz crystals on each corner of the board, lit a candle, and sat down on the floor. Nervously I placed my fingers on the planchette and asked, &amp;quot;Is anybody here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing happened at first, so I kept asking if there were any spirits with me. Finally the planchette started moving towards M.
I was confused at first. Then it went to A, then back over to M, then A again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;#39;t know, Mama is another name Zozo likes to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was freaked out, but I asked, &amp;quot;What do you want with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette swooped over to No, which confused me. Then it went over to Yes, then down to the corner below, then over to the next corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked it up, and apparently when the planchette moves to all four corners it means you have contacted an evil spirit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was starting to panic at this point, so I tried to say Goodbye. The planchette moved to No. At this point, it was going very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want with me?&amp;quot; I asked again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette spelled out, &amp;quot;AZAZAZAZAZAZ.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay. Another one of Zozo&amp;#39;s names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore, and I forced the planchette to goodbye. When I did, the planchette flipped over. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to think of that. I&amp;#39;ve heard that if the planchette falls off the board it means the spirit escaped, but the planchette was still on the board. It was just upside down. I suppose I could&amp;#39;ve accidentally done it with the force I used to move the planchette to Goodbye, but I can&amp;#39;t be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing: when the planchette moved to the bottom corners, one of the plastic glide feet fell off the board, though the rest of the planchette was still on the board. I am not sure if this is a bad thing or not, but I&amp;#39;m going to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m seriously freaked out and scared. I was hoping he&amp;#39;d be gone. The crystals and the sage didn&amp;#39;t do a thing. I&amp;#39;m not sure what I should do now, and I&amp;#39;m scared of what might happen next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 3: The following is a transcript of a text conversation between me and my friend, John, who is kind of an expert on these things. After telling him about the second ouija session with Zozo, this is what he had to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Holy fuck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yeah...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I would&amp;#39;ve called you but I knew your phone wasn&amp;#39;t charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Hugs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: And i was with family&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I really would&amp;#39;ve preferred having someone on video chat while I was dealing with that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: No shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Wish you could have waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I had wanted Kylie because she would&amp;#39;ve been able to sense anything off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Nods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Lol thanks 😉 feel like im chopped liver now lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I have nothing going on tomorrow, and I really need to know if he&amp;#39;s still attached to the board or not. Would tomorrow be good to video chat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I could do it when I get home tonight, but I really don&amp;#39;t want to go near the board at night alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: No dont and its around but not attached&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: The door IS closed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: How can you tell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: It&amp;#39;s still around but it isn&amp;#39;t attached? To me or the board?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Either. But it isnt on our side of tte veil. You trapped it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: But it’s around not happy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I trapped it? How the hell did I do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: When you said goodbye. It was trying to break free and you slammed the door on its foot. Metaphorically speaking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: The AZAZ thing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: So that&amp;#39;s why he likes to constantly spell out his name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: So he can break out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Nope&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: It will attempt to have you not shut the portal when you use the board next. So it could be free, but right now its stewing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: How would it do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Scare you into distraction so you wont say goodbye. Or muck up saying goodbye&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Muck up saying Goodbye? How can you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: As long as you close/say goodbye and focus seeing any portals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Anything else I should look out for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: It will try to scare you and try to have you, let it in. Like a vampire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Come again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Where did I lose you at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Letting it in like a vampire? Vampires need invitation to go in a house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Yep and demons are known to trick people into letting them into a person/persons life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Trick how? I want to know what I should watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Basically dont invite anything into you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: And they love to impersonate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;ve read Zozo is a fan of impersonation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: All demons are with the ouija board &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: So the question is, did me and mom actually contact my grandpa the other night? Is there a way to tell the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Yea but its hard to explain. You would know, gut feeling and everything tells me this time you did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Did contact my grandpa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: After me and my mom finished, I contacted my grandpa again alone, and he gave me a warning. I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly what he said, but I know he mentioned a &amp;quot;him&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Yea you did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: The spirits I talked to Saturday also mentioned a &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; and told me to go away, stop, turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Is there any way to banish him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Let me work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 4: I sent pictures of the Ouija board and the room it&amp;#39;s in to Kylie. She said the picture of the board made her want to throw up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I did a tarot reading for myself. In the past position, I drew the five of Swords reversed. For present, I drew nine of Pentacles reversed. When I went to draw the future card, two cards jumped out of the deck. I took that as a sign and put them both down for future: the ten of wands reversed and The Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still a beginner tarot reader, so I often have to look up the meanings of the cards. It isn&amp;#39;t exactly easy to memorize the meanings of seventy something cards. Anyway, here&amp;#39;s the meanings of the cards in my reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five of Swords reversed: though sometimes a good omen, it can also signify an escalation in violence, conflict, and power struggles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine of Pentacles reversed: lack of independence, confidence, freedom, security, or stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten of Wands reversed: having too much responsibility, stress, a cross that is too heavy to bear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Moon: illusion, fear, anxiety, a difficult period or time when things are not as they seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked someone who&amp;#39;s more experienced than I am, and they drew this meaning from the cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not what it seems. Keep your wits about you and do not divulge anything to those you deem a threat. An unknown event is happening which involves trickery and you are subconciously trying to find your way out of it. You also have lost a little of your independence but feeling less burdened as of late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently trying to decide what my next move should be. Ideally, I would like to find a way to banish Zozo from the board. There&amp;#39;s a couple spells I might be able to try. I&amp;#39;m also wondering if he will show up if I don&amp;#39;t play alone, but I&amp;#39;m not sure who I can play with. Most of my friends live in different states, so there&amp;#39;s only about three people I can ask: my mom, my friend Will, and my cousin Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I played the ouija board with Will, he tried to scare me by moving the planchette. Even if I don&amp;#39;t tell him about Zozo, he will still probably move the planchette himself to scare me. Also, Will is damn near impossible to catch at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris...I&amp;#39;m not sure if Chris would even believe me, and I&amp;#39;m not sure if I can trust him not to move the planchette. I&amp;#39;ve never played with Chris before, so I don&amp;#39;t know what he will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my mom, I really do not want her anywhere near a demon. My mom is a Christian, and she told me when she agreed to play to try to contact my grandpa she did not want to talk to any demons. And I don&amp;#39;t want her talking to any demons either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So right now I&amp;#39;m not sure how I should proceed. Most of the spells I know for dealing with an evil spirits are for trapping it in an inanimate object or are exorcism spells. No one is possessed, so I don&amp;#39;t need an exorcism, and it&amp;#39;s already trapped in the ouija board. What I need is something to banish it from the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to continue to think about this and try to decide my next move. I don&amp;#39;t want this thing around, and I&amp;#39;m going to find some way to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 5: Right now I am mostly just trying to protect myself. I made a protection charm bag earlier and have put it on a chain so I can wear it as a necklace. I&amp;#39;ve prayed to my patron deity and other gods I honor for protection, and I cleansed the room and the board again with white sage. I should note that I had difficulties getting the sage to burn, and when I went to smudge the board I actually had to relight it. The air in that room feels very heavy and oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m scared to touch the board again, at least alone. Until either I can find someone to play with or one of my friends is able to video chat, I&amp;#39;m going to leave it alone. I still want to know if he will only show up if I&amp;#39;m alone, and I&amp;#39;m still looking for a way to banish him from the board completely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did write down one of the exorcism spells I found, which will allow me to imprison him in an inanimate object. But as I said, it&amp;#39;s an exorcism spell; it&amp;#39;s meant to be used to repel a demon from its victim&amp;#39;s body and then trap it in an object. It&amp;#39;s more of a worse case scenario spell right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also going to look through all my protection spells I&amp;#39;ve written down to see what would be the best one for me to use in this situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any advice, I&amp;#39;d be happy to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 6: I had a dream last night about the ouija board. I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly what it was though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered something one of the spirits I talked to Saturday had said. It was the spirit who wouldn&amp;#39;t tell me its name. It repeatedly told me to turn back, and then it spelled out, &amp;quot;Get him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very cryptic and foreboding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in a twist of irony, I&amp;#39;ve found two posts on Facebook today ranting about ouija boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commented on one of the posts about the irony of it, and told her I had contacted something malicious that was still hanging around. She told me to message her, so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing right now. With any luck, she can help me with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing she asked was if it had windows. I said yes. She asked if they could be opened. I didn&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;d never tried. So I went to the room and tried. I was able to open them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me to sage everything right now, and to put a salt circle around the board so it can&amp;#39;t use it as a tether anymore. She said the windows open should make the energies disperse with the sage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was nearly empty the sea salt pouring a circle around the board. I was very careful to make sure there weren&amp;#39;t any breaks in the salt. I&amp;#39;ve seen Supernatural enough times to know how bad that would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was done, I lit the sage and cleansed the room, repeating, &amp;quot;You are not welcome here. Get out. In the name of the gods, begone. I don&amp;#39;t want you here. Get out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing seemed to go wrong. The only way I&amp;#39;ll know for sure is if I use the board. When I do, it&amp;#39;s staying in the salt circle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 7: I finally found someone I could video call to test the board again. I called my friend Rene and asked her if she could please stay on while I tested the board to see if Zozo was still hanging around and if he would show up if I wasn&amp;#39;t alone. She agreed, and even got her own ouija board out so that technically I wouldn&amp;#39;t be playing alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took the board out of the box, left the board in the salt circle, put the quartz crystals on the corners, and started asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t as scary talking to it with someone else there, even if it was over the phone. So here&amp;#39;s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked if anyone was there several times before it started moving. It moved to Goodbye. Basically, it tried to blow us off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rene said something, and I asked if it didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me with Rene there. The planchette moved to No. Then it started spelling out its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rene asked if it could hear her, and it said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it started moving to the four corners. Rene told me not to let it move to the last corner, and I quickly stopped it, nearly flipping the planchette over when I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it started moving between the letters H and A repeatedly. Basically, it was laughing at us. I told it to stop, and it said no. Then it moved to the Z, then the O, then back and forth between the two. ZOZOZOZOZOZO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We know what your freaking name is!&amp;quot; I said. I felt a lot braver with Rene watching everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette spelled out, &amp;quot;b-i-t-c-h.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It called me a bitch,&amp;quot; I told Rene, offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rude,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planchette was moving again. It moved to N, then all the way past the M to a blank area, then the A. I have no idea what it was doing and I am still confused about that. Then it moved downwards to the number zero, then moved over to nine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, I said goodbye and put the board up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the thing&amp;#39;s still hanging around. It didn&amp;#39;t seem to want to talk to me originally with Rene there, since it tried to say goodbye, but since we didn&amp;#39;t let it it talked to us. It wasn&amp;#39;t as scary since I wasn&amp;#39;t alone, and Rene has a way of making everything seem hilarious. Still, I feel anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more things of note, that might have nothing to do with Zozo but I&amp;#39;m still going to mention in case they do: After I said goodbye, I went back to my house and as soon as I walked in my puppy started barking. She&amp;#39;s never done that before, so it seems very weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I started shaking uncontrollably, and Mom complained about making her bed shake because I was leaning against it. I&amp;#39;m not sure what that&amp;#39;s about either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything else happens, I&amp;#39;ll let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 8: So I decided to try automatic writing. I&amp;#39;d heard some people contacted Zozo through automatic writing, and I wanted to see what happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well...I didn&amp;#39;t get Zozo. I think I got Loki, my patron god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not even in my handwriting. But I was just concentrating, having never done this before, and then the next thing I knew I was staring at words written in handwriting that isn&amp;#39;t my own. This is what was on the paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t. Do not give it more power over you.&amp;quot; This was followed by three Nordic runes, Ansuz, Ehwaz, and Hagalaz, and then the words, &amp;quot;Let me take care of this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked it up. Ansuz means &amp;quot;communication,&amp;quot; Ehwaz means &amp;quot;horse,&amp;quot; and Hagalaz means &amp;quot;wrath.&amp;quot; So basically Loki told me to watch out and he&amp;#39;s threatening his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Asatru there&amp;#39;s this thing called horsing, where a god temporarily takes you over, and I think Loki just did that to warn me not to use automatic writing to contact Zozo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing&amp;#39;s for sure: I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be Zozo if Loki unleashes his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 9: So there is water all around the ouija board and the salt circle, and there isn&amp;#39;t water anywhere else in the room. It didn&amp;#39;t rain last night. I have no idea how it got there. Anyone got an explanation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 10: The water is still there. Also, the window in my house keeps getting cracked open. My dog has somehow gotten off her tether twice in the last two days, and I just noticed a box of herbs is on the floor, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I left it on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 11: I have had a fucking terrible day. Came home from the laundromat and my dog got tangled up under the bed again, and we literally had to tear the bed apart to free her. Then my cat got out, went under the house, and is still refusing to come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Zozo side of things, I lit a white sage scented candle, put it on the board, and told it it needed to get out. The candle flame danced erratically the whole time it was lit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I received my emf detector today. I have gotten absolutely nothing in the room the ouija board is in, but I did get one random bleep in my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally talked to Will about what was going on. Unless his plans change, he&amp;#39;s probably going to take me to the Catholic church Sunday to see about getting holy water to dispose of the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips on how to blend in in a Catholic church?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 12: I sent a picture of the board with the water around it to the same person who told me to put salt around the board. She immediately told me to burn the board. She said it was trying to dissolve the salt, and if that happened worse things would come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t destroy the board until I have holy water, so I have at least three more days of this, assuming Will&amp;#39;s plans don&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I was trying to text something, and I accidentally typed out Zaza, even though I wasn&amp;#39;t going anywhere near the Z when I was typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very bad feeling about these next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 13:
There is still water around the board today, but the salt circle is still intact. However, when I went in that room I immediately noticed a temperature drop. That room is colder than anywhere else on my property. It&amp;#39;s a pretty warm day for February. Also, that room seems darker than usual. I mean, there&amp;#39;s no electricity, so it&amp;#39;s always pretty dark, but there are windows so the sun always shines through and lights it up pretty well. The air also very very heavy and oppressive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the emf detector in there. At first, I didn&amp;#39;t get any signal. So I said, &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re here, can you make the emf beep?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silence. Then, one single beep from the emf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at it in surprise, not really expecting anything to happen. &amp;quot;Can you do it again?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing happened. I asked several more times for it to make the emf beep again, but nothing happened again. I eventually gave up, put down some more salt, and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 14: I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure that this is Zozo related, but I feel like it is because ever since I first contacted the damn thing my animals have been acting crazy and keep almost getting themselves killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dog Butterball&amp;#39;s somehow got off her tether twice. My other dog, Lucy, not only got off her tether but out of her collar. They have trashed the house multiple times while we were gone. Butterball nearly killed herself getting tangled up under the bed. A hole in the floor allowed the cat to get out and under the house (but we did get her back in last night), and before she got out the window somehow got cracked open twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then today, Butterball got stuck under the house. She crawled into a hole we had dug when we were trying to get the cat out, got stuck, and here&amp;#39;s the weird part-time hole was filled up when we found her under the house, and there were bits of trash blocking her way too, trash that wasn&amp;#39;t anywhere near the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were digging her out, both me and my mom smelled the most awful smell. It was like a sewage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say for certain that this has anything to do with Zozo, but the fact all this is happening while this demon thing is going on makes me suspicious. And then there was that smell...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 15: I looked up a list of signs of demonic attachment. I think I&amp;#39;m still in the infestation stage, judging from what I found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to John about the weird things that have been happening with the animals. He thinks it may be possible I&amp;#39;m dealing with more than one entity. Maybe Zozo called for backup because he&amp;#39;s still trapped. When he said this, I immediately thought of the spirit I talked to that wouldn&amp;#39;t tell me its name and said to &amp;quot;get him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are getting worse. I need help. If there&amp;#39;s more than one spirit, getting rid of the board probably won&amp;#39;t help. If getting rid of the board doesn&amp;#39;t work, I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 16: I went in there this morning to test the spirit box and nothing happened. Not only that, but the room felt normal. It wasn&amp;#39;t any colder than normal, it didn&amp;#39;t seem darker, and the air wasn&amp;#39;t oppressive. I didn&amp;#39;t sense anything off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell? Is it gone? Why would it just leave?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 17: I talked to John. He and Loki are apparently responsible for this. Here&amp;#39;s a transcript of our conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Did Loki do something? It is suspiciously normal in that room. It&amp;#39;s not cold, not dark, the air isn&amp;#39;t oppressive, the water seems to have dried up...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: He did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: What did he do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I dont feel Zozo around and your puppers should be back to normal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Considering the dreams I had...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: What happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: We astrally fought the demons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Oh...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: He definitely tapped into my anger though&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Holy hells im sooo angry still&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Well more i am very aware now how angry i am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I will be fine later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: But yea im seeing how treuly angry i am and he used it to power boost us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: So it&amp;#39;s over now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: It&amp;#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it looks like it&amp;#39;s over. I&amp;#39;ve put the ouija board in the garage and am going to sell it as soon as I can. It can be someone else&amp;#39;s problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loki has been given the rest of my Valentine candy as a thank you offering. I am so relieved and my heart feels lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"The house I grew up in always gave me a strange feeling. I absolutely hated being alone there, the best way I could describe it is feeling watched in the worst way possible.

1.

2. Later on the day I was cleaning my yard from some leaves and they didnt seem to have any bugs attached to them so I threw them at the rubish thinking what was the chance there would be a bug there crawling out of the trash can when I would use it again later?Seemed like a funny idea at first but it wasnt when I checked the can later.
3. Next day (like 4 hours ago today,yes I woke up to post this) early in the morning I had trouble sleeping and I was thinking of my days when I was in an emergency department in my country on how when we were sleeping we would wake up in the middle of the night when the emergency signals and trumpets would play and how quickly we would wear and grab our gear and weapons and head to the emergency point.Yeah guess what....my house's security signals popped of warning my about potential intruders just when I was thinking about all the chaos.

,Thetruthishere,"I grew up in haunted houses, or more likely, a haunted family. 
One of the scariest points of poltergeist activity happened when we were living in a townhouse. We moved in when the other side of the home was empty, a family lived there for a few months and it was empty again. The last people to live there at the same time as is, were straight up Gypsies. They gave and off vibe and were questionable. During their very short stay (apparently wanted to fraud and such, literally just up and left, we checked the home because the backdoor was unlocked and they literally left everything) and after, activity in our house definitely went up.
The story I’m telling is after they left.

There were three bedrooms on the second floor, two next to each other, one with my older sister and me and my little sister share the other, and the third one, for my mom and my little brother, on the other side of the bathroom in the hall.
It was passed midnight and I was in my older sisters room cause my little sister was asleep and I was bored. We were watching a show, just some late night tv. I was on the floor next to the bed while my sister was on top with our little poodle on the foot of the bed. I was just chilling and she was on the phone with her boyfriend. Just minutes after she was done talking to him, we were startled by her closed bedroom door shaking violently, including the doorknob, as if someone wanted badly to get in. It was shaking so hard it seemed like the walls were shaking with it. 
And then it just stopped. Me, my sister, and my dog looked at each other scared and wide eyed. She called her boyfriend while we decided to probably check the house to make sure no one is inside and the rest of our family is okay. She grabbed a bat by her bed as we gathered the courage the leave the room. We slowly opened the door and used the flashlights on our phone to scan the area. We checked my room next door and my little sister was sound asleep, both of us surprised as she is a light sleeper. 
So we checked my moms room, her and my little brother sound asleep as well. We double checked my brother cause he likes to play games, but he’s not good at faking to be asleep and he didn’t budge.
We checked downstairs in the living room, dinning room and kitchen. No sign of anyone else being inside. No sign of anything to cause the door to move as it did.

,Thetruthishere,"So I guess idk if this counts but I kinda just need to get it outta my head

My cat died a few years ago. She got an infection after being spayed. 

Now, I got her when I was 12-13 so not spaying her was not my decision at first. That was up to my parents and for whatever reason they decided not to do it. There was no way for her to get pregnant so I guess that’s why. 

When I was old enough, her going into heat was annoying so I decided to get her spayed. 

I scheduled her appointment once. For some reason right before that surgery I had a feeling she would die. I actually even asked my boss if taking off work for her death (which had not happened) was a valid reasoning. That first time, I canceled the appointment. 

I was so anxious about her dying that I didn’t reschedule it until few months later. This time I had the same feeling of dread but I didn’t listen to it. This time she did get the surgery and 2 days later she was gone. She had gotten an infection and because the vet was an idiot she died (he didn’t prescribe her antibiotics and continued to assure me that her not eating and not really moving was normal and “just post surgery pain.” When I took her to another vet it was too late)
I still had that bad feeling after her surgery but who am I gonna trust, a “professional” who has done his job for 10 years or my anxiety, which had always been irrational. 

I still don’t understand why I had this thought that she would die from this. Complications with spay surgeries are rare. She was seemingly heathy (I even got her bloodwork done before surgery to make sure her kidneys and liver were okay which could be affected by anesthesia due to her age) There was no reason for me to think she wouldn’t be okay.

,Thetruthishere,"So Um, literally I woke up to a sound like a car motor or something at like 11:40-something and It sounds like it’s coming from my window or something so I get closer and all of a sudden I see a dark figure pass by my window and I’m like oh maybe somebody’s just walking outside, but I glance back at my window and I see what looks like two figures walking with what looks like a tree? Weird I know. And a couple minutes after that, a white bright light shines into my window and it leaves with the sound of the motor (which was actually pretty loud a that point.) the thing is, i live in an apartment complex so basically there’s a sidewalk outside of my house, then some grass, then another apartment buildings driveway. There’s has never been a car in this apartment complex that has been so loud I can hear it through my window (which has plastic in it bc it’s cold outside) Also, I don’t know how the light could have been a car because it was so bright and almost looked like it was shining directly into my window. After that I heard some sort of shuffling sound inside my house and there were a few more shadows outside.

Weird I know. And a couple minutes after that, a white bright light shines into my window and it leaves with the sound of the motor (which was actually pretty loud a that point.) the thing is, i live in an apartment complex so basically there’s a sidewalk outside of my house, then some grass, then another apartment buildings driveway. There’s has never been a car in this apartment complex that has been so loud I can hear it through my window (which has plastic in it bc it’s cold outside) Also, I don’t know how the light could have been a car because it was so bright and almost looked like it was shining directly into my window.

We had been dating for 4 months at the time and just moved in together. I didn’t know at the time but she had gone off her meds. This all happened while I was at work and she told me about it later.

She went out for a walk to get some air because she was feeling really claustrophobic, the start of a manic/depressive episode. It got to the point she thought dying would be the best option and standing at corner she thought the best idea would be to just walk into traffic.

This is the first time I’m actually writing about this. So when I was 13, my older brother (18) and I were on our way to a movie when we were hit by a drunk driver. I woke up in hospital 4 days later, having lost my right leg and other leg in cast along with other injuries. That night I woke up to my my brother sitting by my bed telling me everything will be okay and to go back to sleep. 

   Next day parents came to visit and see how I was doing. I asked why my brother wasn’t with them and they looked at each other but didn’t say anything.  That night I again woke up to brother sitting by my bed again telling me he knows I can get through this and I need to be strong and overcome this and not let my injuries stop me from living life. We talked a bit, him not answering specific questions but answering more general questions. Remember asking him why he was still wearing clothes from yesterday because that was very unlike him to wear anything similar to what he wore the day before.  He didn’t answer that but when asked how he was he said better than he thought he would be given the circumstances. He reminded me to be strong and keep living and not let anything stop me and how much he love me before telling me I should get some more sleep.

  That next day parents again came to visit me in hospital and I again asked why brother wasn’t with them and they again looked at each other and it was only after I said that I would like family visit together and not at different times and would like brother to visit during day when we can talk more, instead of at night that my dad asked what I meant and I told him Andy had been coming at night to visit. My mom broke down and left the room. My dad then told me that was impossible because Andy died in the accident instantly. I didn’t believe it and argued it and ended up having to be sedated. That night I had no visit and next day parents brought newspaper article about the accident. 

 Years later my fiancée had an experience and having never seen a photo of my brother, she described him to a t and what he was wearing. That is a story for another time, but it was nice knowing brother is still around and looking out for me and those I love.

,Thetruthishere,"I didn’t think I’d have another post to add here since the last was dealing with something I experienced as a child, but this past week I’ve had a couple weird experiences. 

I live scary movies, video games, and stories. I live for them, like I’m sure most of us here do too. I am very easily scared though, and typically will be a wuss when it comes time to crawl in bed. I’ll play a happy song on my phone before bed, sleep with my back to the wall, the usual “I am a scaredy cat” things. Well, I went to bed Tuesday night, not really that scared despite having watched a couple videos of people reading scary stories about home invasions. I crawled into bed on my left side, turned out the light, and closed my eyes. That’s when I heard something that truly scared me to the bone. “Steven.” A name I haven’t gone by in over a year, whispered in my right ear. The voice was that of a man, but not one I recognized. My eyes shot open and I looked up and behind me to find nothing was there. I was shaking, unsure if I should try to turn on the light or not. After a few moments, I reached for my light and turned it on, confirming the voice was not of anything I could see. 

Two days later, I had a long day at work and hadn’t been sleeping well. I decided I would take a nap on the couch while I waited for my dinner to be delivered. I laid down on my left side and shut my eyes when I heard a familiar voice, this time in my left ear (the one on the couch pillow). “What was that?” It whispered like before sounding like it was only an inch from my ear. It wasn’t as scary as before, mainly because I had heard it once already and this time it wasn’t coming from a direction that made sense. I was still a little shaken, looked around, and decided to go back to trying to nap. 

I haven’t heard it in a couple days. I don’t know what it is though and it is kind of scary. Part of me thinks it is an auditory hypnagogic hallucination, though I have only ever had full hypnagogic hallucinations (audio and visual) and only when really sleep deprived (was up for over 36 hours) on a couple occasions in my life. Whether it is a real voice of something speaking to me or not, I don’t know. My friend told me to keep him informed and that I should name the voice to make it feel less scary. I was hesitant since I know they say names have power, but I decided to give it a name anyways. The first name that came to mind was “Dimitri”, so that is what I’ve been calling him.

,Thetruthishere,"In my house, we have a little girl spirit that likes to hang around. My mom is rather sensitive to paranormal things, and with our little girl, she’s heard her (one time saying “I love you mommy” in the middle of the night while I was dead asleep, one time her voice saying “Let me be your teddy bear” in my mom’s ear along with the Elvis song of the same name that was playing) and has had recurring dreams with her standing by her bedside. Both of the speaking instances happened either a decade or more ago, and my mom doesn’t like to “scare” me with her experiences, so I don’t really think about our little girl 24/7. 

About a month ago, I was home from college for winter break. On our second floor, my bedroom is at one end of a hallway, and my parents’ bedroom is at the other. That morning, my dog had been running back and forth between bedrooms and begging to get onto someone’s bed (she’s a shitzu mix, so she can’t exactly do it herself) only to jump off again, so my mom and I were yelling back and forth to each other about who was going to take her. Finally, we settled to just let the dog sit by herself at the top of the stairs, right outside of my bedroom door. All’s fine and dandy, so I got relaxed and prepared to get back to sleeping in. 

But just around the corner from the entrance to my bedroom, I heard a girl’s voice clearly say, “It’s okay to sleep.” I didn’t know if she was talking to my mom and I or if she was talking to my dog, but it still woke me up completely.

Her voice almost sounded like it was coming from a loud TV, but my mom and I were the only people home—and my dog can’t talk. I’m an only child, so it wasn’t a sibling playing a joke. We live in a neighborhood where everyone knows everyone, and I know for sure no random girl had broken in. 

My theory for a few years has been that our little girl is a leftover, if you will, of whatever happened on our property before it was developed and we built our house on it. The entire town used to be totally covered in farmland, so I don’t think it’s out of the way to believe that our property is a section of a bigger one that was split into pieces for profit. 

Putting explanation aside, I was way more excited about the whole thing than I was scared. It felt like our little girl finally trusted me—maybe because I’m an “adult” now? Even if I’m only 19. Maybe because she really likes our dog? The dog IS pretty dang cute. Either way, that night I told her (or, the room at large?) she could play with whatever she wanted to in my bedroom as long as she didn’t wake me up.

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, I was home from college for winter break. On our second floor, my bedroom is at one end of a hallway, and my parents’ bedroom is at the other. That morning, my dog had been running back and forth between bedrooms and begging to get onto someone’s bed (she’s a shitzu mix, so she can’t exactly do it herself) only to jump off again, so my mom and I were yelling back and forth to each other about who was going to take her. Finally, we settled to just let the dog sit by herself at the top of the stairs, right outside of my bedroom door. All’s fine and dandy, so I got relaxed and prepared to get back to sleeping in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just around the corner from the entrance to my bedroom, I heard a girl’s voice clearly say, “It’s okay to sleep.” I didn’t know if she was talking to my mom and I or if she was talking to my dog, but it still woke me up completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her voice almost sounded like it was coming from a loud TV, but my mom and I were the only people home—and my dog can’t talk. I’m an only child, so it wasn’t a sibling playing a joke. We live in a neighborhood where everyone knows everyone, and I know for sure no random girl had broken in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My theory for a few years has been that our little girl is a leftover, if you will, of whatever happened on our property before it was developed and we built our house on it. The entire town used to be totally covered in farmland, so I don’t think it’s out of the way to believe that our property is a section of a bigger one that was split into pieces for profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting explanation aside, I was way more excited about the whole thing than I was scared. It felt like our little girl finally trusted me—maybe because I’m an “adult” now? Even if I’m only 19. Maybe because she really likes our dog? The dog IS pretty dang cute. Either way, that night I told her (or, the room at large?) she could play with whatever she wanted to in my bedroom as long as she didn’t wake me up. I’m back at school now, but I haven’t had any updates from home about anything like this... yet!&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Backround info:

There is a small room upstairs in our house where my mum has a small collection of the dolls (she no longer collects them) with porcelain heads and hands and legs which are almost immovable - they are manufactured to remain in a stand position (this is important). They have been standing on a shelf with  their heads  straightened (when you are standing directly across from them they are looking directly to your face) for more than 20 years without any moves or falling (some of them even in our previous house which I don't remember, because I was very young when we moved away). Note: The room is full of needless things and apart from me no one goes there and I go there about three times a year usually.

All the incidents meanwhile:

The first weird thing happened last year on 11th August when I went there looking for an old german dictionary. I was searching in the library at the opposite part of the room and suddenly a doll almost fell on my head. It confused me, because there should not be a doll standing on the library, all of them were always on the shelf. I turned around and saw an empty place in a row of the standing dolls on the shelf. But who would did it? My mum has a trouble with walking and wasn't upstairs couple of years and my dad goes only to a room with a solar inverter. I put the doll on the table under the window and went away (I had to do something).

I returned there on 19th August with the idea to put the doll back on the shelf. But immediately after I came there I saw that five dolls were sitting on the shelf with their heads turned to the window (but the one from 11 August remained in an unchanged position). The four of them were the closest ones to the door, the fifth one was a doll dressed as a countess in red.  I quickly found out that put them back to the standing position was very difficult (you have to do this very slowly and must be careful). I did it, but still didn't understand how would be possible they had been able to change the position of their bodies and heads on their own and even looked like if somebody had arranged them. I decided to keep an eye on them.

I went to check them out once more that day and found that my effort to make them standing was useless. That time SIX of them were sitting on the shelf (five were the same, the new one a doll dressed as a countess in blue). The new doll had head turned to the door, the five other faced to the window again. I didn't try to put them back to the right position, because I was already afraid of them. I ran away from the room.

I took courage to go there at the end of the August. The six were sitting in the same position, but the doll which I had placed on the table under the window wasn't there. She was standing on the shelf with family albums which was under the shelf with other dolls. I put the doll back on the table and went away.

For couple of months the dolls didn't move (I was going there to check them), but when I went there at 21. 30 PM CET tonight, only four nearest to the door were sitting. Two countesses are standing again, but how can doll change a position from sitting to standing on her own?! I even didn't check the one which should be on the table under the window.

No other signs of anything paranormal in the house right now. The dolls are completely covered in dust, if somebody living was moving with them, they wouldn't be.

My question is: What to do with them?

UPDATE 1:

[https://imgur.com/a/dqDryeF](https://imgur.com/a/dqDryeF)

Yesterday I scattered salt at the doorway and put the crucifix on the left side of the table (very much on the left, can't be seen in pictures with the doll) in order to face directly to the dolls.

Today I have read comment sugesting to take a picture at least. I took the doll which has been moving around a room from the shelf with albums and put her on the table to make a picture of her (sorry for  bad quality, it was done in a hurry). I took it at 13. 29 CET PM and left.

I came back an hour later and saw the scene didn't look like I left it and I am 100 % sure nobody was upstairs since I left, because I was in a living room whole time and from a place where I sat I would see if somebody went upstairs. The first thing which I noticed immediately was the crucifix stood next to the doll on the right side and was facing me (east) not the dolls. I checked the picture I took with a position of the doll and saw the doll moved too (but a little one in comparison with her previous moves). I took another picture of the doll at 14. 33 CET PM.

The third one shows a mark in the dust where was the crucifix placed at first. Another bigger update will be after I got the camera. I probably won't be here tomorrow and after tomorrow, because of Sabine storm.

4 years ago, my sister and I became ADDICTED to using the board, to the point where we were using the thing every single day for probably two months. We could not put it down without feeling a sense of longing for it and I honestly don’t know why. We ran into some creepy things but we could usually shut it down by disconnecting. That was until we ran into a certain entity by the name of “Jixi or Jixie” I haven’t contacted it in a long time so I do not know the correct spelling. It originally pretended to be someone else who we contacted a lot as we were CONFIDENT that that person was safe, however there was a sudden shift in energy one day which threw us off and caused it’s true identity to be revealed when asked. The entity told us that it was constantly able to watch us through the paintings we had in our house and was anchored to the Phoenix painting we have on the wall of our stairs. It also threatened my sister at the time (2016) saying that it would kill her on New Year’s Eve. It’s been 4 years since the threat but each year we still worry. After contacting that entity our house became plagued with what I can only assume to be a poltergeist for over a year. My sister and I sleep on the top floor while our parents are on the bottom floor. Footsteps could be heard going from my room to my sisters room pretty much every night as well as banging from the attic. One time the door to the guest room swung wide open while my sister and her friends were in the room and my mother and I were in the basement with no one else in the house.

I really have been avoiding talking about this or searching for answers because I am terrified of the possible explanations. I am a 20yr old female in college and I am seriously at my wits end with this. 
Since I was a child I have had many “paranormal” experiences. I used to spend summers at my friends house (built in 1640), I would often hear footsteps and voices even when we were alone in the home. I was 9 years old when this started. 
Ever since, I often find myself hearing voices/sounds, seeing shadows, feeling things, or seeing things move. It is not frequent and has only happened in particular places, until now. 
I am living in a pretty modern apartment (last 10 years). I have begun to see shadows or see/hear things move VERY frequently since about October 2019. 
It is starting to feel like maybe I am being followed by a spirit or am more in tune to spirits? 
OR, should I consider seeing a psychologist for something mental? There is 0 history of schizophrenia or anything similar in any of my family members. Is it me? Is it the buildings I’m going to? Am I being followed?
This has been tormenting me for years of my life. People often ask me if I can communicate with spirits or if I am more in tune to the spirit world. Could it be this? 
I am desperate for any advice or answers!

,Thetruthishere,"Aliens:

1) saw a man in public once who was almost fully clothes with the only exception being his hands and face (but was wearing sunglasses. It was a hot day so him having such amount and thick clothing on was weird, however, the clothing wasn't baggy. What was strange to me was his arms were extremely long, compared to the reast of his body and looked like his elbows bent the other way. like if he was to get his arm naturally his hand could easily touch his shoulder blade.A way to describe this man's proportions is; open and editing program and get an image of a 6 footman. then squish the image in on it'self slightly from the sides. doesnt grow in hight but becomes unnaturally thin, tic-tac looking head etc. but edit his arms to look unnaturally long. thing how sonic characters arms look, almost touching the floor from the tips of their fingers.he was interacting somewhat with his surroundings and people did notice him there (swerved around to get past him) but nobody noticed how oddly dressed or how oddly long his arms were? looked about 30.  


2)Another time was ufo i saw out of my bedroom window. Saw a weird looking shape in the sky one time. about dusk. think the triforce from the legend of Zelda. 3 triangular shapes where each point had a blue-white glowing orb on it. 9 glowing orbs in total as the triangles didn't meet, leaving way for all 9 glowing orbs. the triangles were faintly outlined with lines. tried getting a photo of it on my ds as i had no mobile at the time but the quality was too poor to even bother with it. it hovered around the place for about 10 ish minuted before vanishing into thin air after i looked away for a second or so.  


Unexplainable  


1) encountered a weird woman.  She was telling me about demons and the sort. that night, i fell asleep alright but woke up to hearing howling in the distance. wasnt one of our/neerby dog, and didnt sound like an animal eoither, somewhat human. fell asleep as i didnt think much of it and woke up to a black room yet the lights were still on? like if someone but a sheet of black plastic over my eyes but you could still barely see through it. my eyes were fully opened and i could sit up and move about alright as i needed the reastroom. went back asleep and woke up at about twilight. most heaviset thing felt like it was pressing down on my chest, like an elephant calf was sat on it. i closed my eyes and heard that howling noise again but felt like it was coming from ontop of me, it was loud and send me into a panick. i saw the woman again a week later and the first thing she said was 'did you hear the howling too?' and told me she went though something similar. she was in her 40's and i was 16/17 at the time.  


2) Saw some goat-man humanoid figure when iw as in a forrest on a trip with primary school. it wasn't Halloween either and his body proportions looked to good to me cosplay.  
His legs bent in tht natural deer/goat looking way and i know this illusion can be pulled off decently well if you look at fursuits but this was bent SO much that it couldn't have been a cosplay suit. His arms looked overly-hairy and he had little Stubbs as horns. he was in the forrest, sat on a rock with a cloak on. i started looking at him then i noticed him standing up to take his cloak off. He wasn't wearing anything and his body was human liked but 'cut off' to goat legs at his belly button section. his feet looked aprt human, part hoof also. his face looked more diamond-shaped, akin to a goat but still had human esque features like normal eyes, mouth, nose, by what i could tell.  
This was not appart of the 'experience' of the trip as we went to do bird wathcing and to collect leaves and acorns for a school project. Nobody else as far as i'm aware saw it and i'm not in contact with anybody from primary school to even ask.  


  
3) Recently on the bus home from college, i saw a flying figure in the sky, it wasnt a bird or any kind of flying machine like helicopter or drone etc. It looked similar to the grim reaper without his scythe. torn up clacked-ghostly looking thing. i'd say about 200 feet up in the air. just flying there, not fast, just havering about pretty much. not doing anything, just like it wat he does as a hoppy/to relax yourself in his past time. I saw him for about 10 minutes as there was a road blockage due to a car-van crash. I overheard people speaking to eachother about tthe crash a few days later and one of them said 'yep, both drivers died aswell as a passenger in the van'.  


4) I once saw a white, blonde woman on their laptop minding their own busness in a caffee. I was outside waiting for someone and looked around and then looked back into the caffe and where that woman was sitting, a black man was sat there now. Shaved head, bearded, with glasses on. same laptop, cup of drink was in the same place. I thought nothing of it as 'she could have left and he took the spot?'

,Thetruthishere,"TL;DR: I seemed to always find myself in dangerous, potentially deadly, situations for seemingly no apparent reason until the therapist I was seeing asked if it was possible I had a death wish 


Hi! First time poster here, long-time lurker. I’m not sure if this is the right flare to add to my post so please let me know if it isn’t.

A bit of background before we get into the story. For as long as I can remember I’ve experienced strange things. Usually it’s just hearing voices calling me or seeing various entities, etc. This particular story is more of a series of events that led to a conclusion.

As a kid, there was one incident where I was walking home from the neighborhood pool with my brother and a couple cousins. I reached the crossing a minute or two before them and decided not to wait for them. I looked both ways multiple times and not seeing any cars I started crossing the road to the next crossing and my brother started yelling at me to stop. I turned to look back at him and he asked why I didn’t stop at the intersection. When I told him that I did and looked several times before walking, he told me that there was no way that I could’ve stopped because they weren’t that far behind me and if I did stop I would’ve seen that it wasn’t safe to cross. I argued back that it was safe to cross when I started crossing and he looked me dead in the eyes and said “if that car hadn’t stopped, you’d be dead” and that’s when it dawned on me to look around again. There was a black sedan with tinted windows sitting just inches away from me. I hadn’t seen or heard it drive up.

So between the ages of eight and seventeen, I almost drowned several times. The last time was probably the scariest. I was at a youth camp with a friend’s youth group and we had gone for a swim in the lake during free time. So a group of us decided to swim out to a boat to go jet skiing. It wasn’t a very far swim, maybe about a couple hundred feet or so, and I wanted to ride a jet ski in an environment where it wasn’t storming. 

Halfway there for whatever reason, I decided to turn back. I swam back and once I reached a spot where I know I could stand, I stopped but as my right foot touched the bottom of the lake a hand grabbed my right ankle and pulled me under. It was gripping me so tightly I could feel the claws digging into my skin. I struggled and called for help until I heard a voice say “stop struggling. No one’s coming” and I felt myself go  limp and be pulled further under the water. Right as I was beginning to lose consciousness, I was pulled out by a girl I had just met. She helped me back to the dock where I coughed up a lot of water and cried for a bit. It’ll be five years this summer and to this day I can still feel the hand gripping onto my ankle with the force to crush it.

After I got my license, I spent a lot of time with friends when I could. The first time anything weird happened while I was driving, I was out with a friend and we’d run a few errands for her mom before going to pick up her cousin. We stopped at an intersection and the light had just turned red. As we sat there, I watched the light change from red to green and so I accelerated thinking that it was a standard green light, but it almost felt heavy if that makes sense. I describe it as feeling kinda like I was in a trance. My friend started yelling “op, op, what are you doing? Op, stop!” and I snapped out of whatever state I was in and realized that we were seconds away from being t-boned and possibly killed by this massive white van. I moved back into my original spot and I kept trying to tell my friend that the light had been green but she didn’t believe me 

After that, I started getting into accidents, mostly just minor things like accidental bumper taps. The second of the three I was in (which was the most major), I was driving to a job interview and my vision went white. It was almost like someone put a white cloth over my head and by the time I could see again, I was plowing into the back of another SUV.

About six months to a year after that, my parents took me to see a therapist because they  were worried that I might’ve been suicidal. The therapist asked general questions about my behavior leading up to not only seeing her but also to some of the events. I was honest with her and then she asked me if I’d ever heard of a death wish. I admitted that I hadn’t and she told me that she figured I had one.

I’m still not sure what to think. I haven’t had anymore accidents but it can be argued that I’ve simply just found a car more suited to me instead of a death wish. However, I haven’t been able to find a lot about it but if you guys have any ideas on what could’ve been happening, let me know.",t2_2lveuyxe,False,,0,False,Was it a death wish or just bad luck?,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,dis,0,False,t3_ezxflf,False,dark,,public,27,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion/Advice,False,27,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1581045866.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I seemed to always find myself in dangerous, potentially deadly, situations for seemingly no apparent reason until the therapist I was seeing asked if it was possible I had a death wish &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi! First time poster here, long-time lurker. I’m not sure if this is the right flare to add to my post so please let me know if it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of background before we get into the story. For as long as I can remember I’ve experienced strange things. Usually it’s just hearing voices calling me or seeing various entities, etc. This particular story is more of a series of events that led to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid, there was one incident where I was walking home from the neighborhood pool with my brother and a couple cousins. I reached the crossing a minute or two before them and decided not to wait for them. I looked both ways multiple times and not seeing any cars I started crossing the road to the next crossing and my brother started yelling at me to stop. I turned to look back at him and he asked why I didn’t stop at the intersection. When I told him that I did and looked several times before walking, he told me that there was no way that I could’ve stopped because they weren’t that far behind me and if I did stop I would’ve seen that it wasn’t safe to cross. I argued back that it was safe to cross when I started crossing and he looked me dead in the eyes and said “if that car hadn’t stopped, you’d be dead” and that’s when it dawned on me to look around again. There was a black sedan with tinted windows sitting just inches away from me. I hadn’t seen or heard it drive up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So between the ages of eight and seventeen, I almost drowned several times. The last time was probably the scariest. I was at a youth camp with a friend’s youth group and we had gone for a swim in the lake during free time. So a group of us decided to swim out to a boat to go jet skiing. It wasn’t a very far swim, maybe about a couple hundred feet or so, and I wanted to ride a jet ski in an environment where it wasn’t storming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway there for whatever reason, I decided to turn back. I swam back and once I reached a spot where I know I could stand, I stopped but as my right foot touched the bottom of the lake a hand grabbed my right ankle and pulled me under. It was gripping me so tightly I could feel the claws digging into my skin. I struggled and called for help until I heard a voice say “stop struggling. No one’s coming” and I felt myself go  limp and be pulled further under the water. Right as I was beginning to lose consciousness, I was pulled out by a girl I had just met. She helped me back to the dock where I coughed up a lot of water and cried for a bit. It’ll be five years this summer and to this day I can still feel the hand gripping onto my ankle with the force to crush it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got my license, I spent a lot of time with friends when I could. The first time anything weird happened while I was driving, I was out with a friend and we’d run a few errands for her mom before going to pick up her cousin. We stopped at an intersection and the light had just turned red. As we sat there, I watched the light change from red to green and so I accelerated thinking that it was a standard green light, but it almost felt heavy if that makes sense. I describe it as feeling kinda like I was in a trance. My friend started yelling “op, op, what are you doing?

since 2010 I've had onset of a progressive neurological condition. The first symptom was tinnitus that is orthostatic meaning it is both triggered by and made worse by me being upright. The other symptoms were episodes of vertigo, and severe headaches.

I'm now experiencing cognitive decline including memory loss and dementia like episodes. I'm often sleeping for days on end without getting out of bed and my entire family is very worried about me. I also get very irritable and sensitive to sound and light at night. For the past year, my symptoms have accelerated exponentially and the orthostatic part is becoming blurred ie it now takes 8-10 hours of lying down to reduce my symptoms to 10% of what they are right before I sleep. 

I am also experiencing a build up of ''fluid'' behind my eardrum, 7/10 times I see a doctor, there is ''bubbly fluid'' behind my eardrum. 

I've been seeing ENT's and other doctors but some doctors have been very arrogant and not compassionate. The headaches and other symptoms are very negatively affecting both my physical and mental health and I am on strong medication to avoid outbursts due to my symptoms. I've previously been sent to the ER because my symptoms are making me feel mentally unstable. 

I am losing faith in doctors and feel like they do not care about me. I feel like I am stuck in a purgatory of suffering. I've been considering acupuncture therapy or magic healing (potions, spells, occult healing, etc). I have seen many stories here on Reddit that have convinced me that magic is real.

According to a few people my symptoms are consistent with a ***spinal CSF leak*** and this does get progressively worse over time as the leak sites ''open up'' more and more. If it is indeed a CSF leak, I am in the late stages and the next stage listed after ''dementia like symptoms'' is ''stupor'' and ''coma''.

What I remember about my childhood home was that it was really haunted but the room I found the most creepy was my parent’s bedroom. My dad was always away for business when I was younger so it was always my mom and I at home. 

The bedroom had a floral patterned wallpaper with weird swirls that looks like a man’s face grinning at you. I always thought maybe i was just a child with a wild imagination but I mentioned this to my mom recently and she said she always thought the wallpaper looked like faces as well. 

I’m not sensitive to anything paranormal anymore but I had a heart disease as a child and made me really weak so I was pretty sensitive to paranormal stuff. I remember I would lie on my mom’s bed for an afternoon nap and wake up slightly paralysed. The floral wallpaper faces would morph in this weird way and I would hear echoey voices of a group of people chattering away. 

My mom used to always stay in bed from severe depression. She later on told me that she felt like she couldn’t breathe when she was alone in that bedroom. She found the floral wallpaper faces really disturbing and had a similar but more severe experience like mine.

,Thetruthishere,"Hello all. I would like to say a few things before I get into the actual list of encounters that my family has had in my childhood home. First of all, I feel as though I should say that everything that occurred is TRUE and unexaggerated (as best I could, although feelings are involved, and when feelings are involved, it sometimes becomes difficult). Secondly, I am asking for opinions but please do your best to be respectful if you choose to comment - for better or for worse, I am a sensitive person and will probably take snippy comments to heart. 

I will try to keep this as succinct as possible, but it's not going to be a short post. Please bear with me.

My parents, me, and my two younger sisters have lived in my great-grandmother's old house since I was born. The house was built in the 1890s, and though I have done research in the town's archives, it's history, before my great-grandfather bought it in 1955, is vague. I couldn't even find information on the previous owners. My Gram is now passed away and she didn't have any information in her personal documents either. I only found one article about the house's history - in the late 1800s, just after the house was erected, a water pipe was under construction across the street. In a freak accident, the pipe apparently burst, injuring a young man. The man, who was named George, was brought to what is now my parents' house, where he unfortunately passed away before the doctor could arrive. 

This story is why my sister and I began to refer to the entity in our house as ""George"". Me, the oldest, and Rose, the youngest, are the only ones in our family who accept that the odd things that happen in our house are most likely supernatural. Our family is deeply religious, you see, and my father insists that ghosts and God are diametrically opposed. ""If there is something in the house,"" he says, ""then it's a demon masquerading as a ghost."" He'll sit us down every time we're trying to do some sleuthing or discussing a strange event, and in a very serious tone, sputter, ""You'd better not try to communicate with it, now. The Bible says that's forbidden."" So we don't try to communicate with George. But George tries to communicate with us. 

I think, even for all of his sputtering and insisting, that my father was the first to have a documented encounter with George. Years ago, before he'd met my mother and when his grandmother and grandfather still ran the house and barn as a working farm, he had stayed over to tend to the cows while his grandparents were off on an overnight trip somewhere. He had done this several times, but, as he tells it, this time, he was lying in his bed and he kept hearing a voice talking. He got up and looked around, but he couldn't figure out where it was coming from. He went back to bed when the voice seemed to shut up, but before long, it started up again, and he still had no idea if someone was in the house or not. Finally, it was quiet enough for him to fall asleep. The next day, he was out in the barn milking the cows when he heard the voice again! This time, he followed it to an old radio in the part of the barn used for storage, laughed at himself for being so worked up the previous night, and turned it off. However, the radio was broken, had not been used in a long time, and Dad doesn't remember if it was plugged in or not. 

For years my family took this story as a funny anecdote of something that happened when my father was a teenager, and laughed it off - until my now-fiancé came to have dinner with the family. My Dad told this story because my sister and I were talking about how the house was haunted, and my Dad was trying to use it to change our minds. But Aaron, my fiancé who is by no means a believer in anything, said, ""Well, if you were the only one in the house, how would the radio have turned on?"" 

Interesting. 

Every one of my family members has a story about George, even the ones who don't believe he is a ghost. My middle sister Rachael thought that I was home because she heard footsteps in the upstairs gallery, when in fact she was alone. There is a door that never closes, no matter how many times we try to shut it or fix the hinges. I have heard a distinct, short cough/clearing of the throat sound several times, at night or when I've been alone. Mom, Rachael, Rose and I have all seen a person in the corner of our eye, who then isn't there when we turn to address them. It is somewhat cliche, but at the top of the stairs to the end of the upstairs gallery there is a cold spot that comes and goes with seeming no natural reason. In what I will call the ""West Wing"" (for dramatic effect, although it's really just the westernmost side of the house), everyone has felt disturbed or uncomfortable at one point or another, just a general uneasiness. 

There is a bedroom there that we keep as a guest room, with the original furnishings of the house intact. Once I was babysitting my little cousins, one of whom is a baby of 13 months, and I was attempting to put her down for a nap in that room. The entire time, she would point at the old mirror in there and wail her head off. When I took her out of the room, she went right to sleep on the living room couch, like the perfect angel she is. 

We feel that the West Wing, which consists of the guest bedroom, the main hall staircase, the upper gallery and Rachael's bedroom, is the most haunted area of the house. We have more stories, but I will close with this one: I have a photograph of the ghost in our house. In the so-called West Wing, under the main staircase, I keep a stationary bike so that when I don't feel like going to the gym, I can still work out. One such night, I was home alone and felt like I needed a little workout, so I hopped on the bike, although I was uneasy in there from the start. As my workout progressed, I felt like someone was watching me, but I knew from past experience that if I turned around, that someone would not be there. So instead, I pulled my phone from my pocket, aimed it at the reflection of the door in an old photo that my dad had hung there, and snapped. I would have attached the photo if I could for your review - in it, as I believe one can clearly see, is a face, and that face is strangely feminine. 

Since this photo was taken, my sisters and I have begun calling the ghost ""Georgette"", instead of ""George"", but we have no idea who she is or if she is the only entity in the house. We don't feel like she is a danger, and she has never harmed us. So please let me know what you think about this. Can a house that is full of Christians be haunted? Is religion and the supernatural completely unrelated, as I tend to believe? Why is our house ghost a female when the only tragic death documented has been a male? Why the West Wing?

However, the radio was broken, had not been used in a long time, and Dad doesn&amp;#39;t remember if it was plugged in or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years my family took this story as a funny anecdote of something that happened when my father was a teenager, and laughed it off - until my now-fiancé came to have dinner with the family. My Dad told this story because my sister and I were talking about how the house was haunted, and my Dad was trying to use it to change our minds. But Aaron, my fiancé who is by no means a believer in anything, said, &amp;quot;Well, if you were the only one in the house, how would the radio have turned on?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every one of my family members has a story about George, even the ones who don&amp;#39;t believe he is a ghost. My middle sister Rachael thought that I was home because she heard footsteps in the upstairs gallery, when in fact she was alone. There is a door that never closes, no matter how many times we try to shut it or fix the hinges. I have heard a distinct, short cough/clearing of the throat sound several times, at night or when I&amp;#39;ve been alone. Mom, Rachael, Rose and I have all seen a person in the corner of our eye, who then isn&amp;#39;t there when we turn to address them. It is somewhat cliche, but at the top of the stairs to the end of the upstairs gallery there is a cold spot that comes and goes with seeming no natural reason. In what I will call the &amp;quot;West Wing&amp;quot; (for dramatic effect, although it&amp;#39;s really just the westernmost side of the house), everyone has felt disturbed or uncomfortable at one point or another, just a general uneasiness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a bedroom there that we keep as a guest room, with the original furnishings of the house intact. Once I was babysitting my little cousins, one of whom is a baby of 13 months, and I was attempting to put her down for a nap in that room. The entire time, she would point at the old mirror in there and wail her head off. When I took her out of the room, she went right to sleep on the living room couch, like the perfect angel she is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel that the West Wing, which consists of the guest bedroom, the main hall staircase, the upper gallery and Rachael&amp;#39;s bedroom, is the most haunted area of the house. We have more stories, but I will close with this one: I have a photograph of the ghost in our house. In the so-called West Wing, under the main staircase, I keep a stationary bike so that when I don&amp;#39;t feel like going to the gym, I can still work out. One such night, I was home alone and felt like I needed a little workout, so I hopped on the bike, although I was uneasy in there from the start. As my workout progressed, I felt like someone was watching me, but I knew from past experience that if I turned around, that someone would not be there. So instead, I pulled my phone from my pocket, aimed it at the reflection of the door in an old photo that my dad had hung there, and snapped. I would have attached the photo if I could for your review - in it, as I believe one can clearly see, is a face, and that face is strangely feminine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this photo was taken, my sisters and I have begun calling the ghost &amp;quot;Georgette&amp;quot;, instead of &amp;quot;George&amp;quot;, but we have no idea who she is or if she is the only entity in the house. We don&amp;#39;t feel like she is a danger, and she has never harmed us. So please let me know what you think about this. Can a house that is full of Christians be haunted? Is religion and the supernatural completely unrelated, as I tend to believe? Why is our house ghost a female when the only tragic death documented has been a male? Why the West Wing? And don&amp;#39;t get me started on the basement, I won&amp;#39;t even go down there because there is such a dark feeling emanating from it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"I am a new member of the community, so my apologies if I have not posted this thread in the correct forum. Perhaps I am paranoid, but I like to found a good impression.

A 'fringe' subject I have been very interested in is the subject of reincarnation. I have studied it rather extensively as well as relating some traits of cases to my experiences.

I am a little skittish about directly stating who I was, given that there appears to be a cultish group who like to twist my case and use it for a preconceived agenda, but I was the second man on this list; http://www.ranker.co...ching/reference

Unfortunately, the only reason I was famous was because of how I died. I was lynched. I'm also a Jew in this life, as well. Unsurprisingly, I've been very interested in the past life experiences of others as well as how they relate to mine. I come from a fairly irreligious family who believe that we only live once, and this is one of the only places I have came across where I feel confident to discuss the subject of past lives, so do excuse me. It appears that people are still interested in this case as I came across a film about it the other night.

I'm also interested in finding any living relatives.

I am also open to any polite debates on the subject of reincarnation in itself and aforementioned related topics, such as past life regression and the findings of Dr. Ian Stevenson. It is approximately 3 'o clock in the morning at the time of writing, so excuse me for the vagueness of my post. I'll answer questions in the morning.


Ever since I was little, I looked physically different to that of my parents. I had large, prominent eyes, and an oval face. My family all have round faces by comparison. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Right so since I was real young I'd had memories of a former life. Here's the details; I'd had a wife named Lucy, and she'd usually wear a white dress. She also had black hair. I died from being hanged from a tree and during this my neck went up and I have a birthmark on the back of my neck there too. I worked at some kind of factory. It was dark bricked, was four stories tall and long. I don't get a good vibe about it I told my parents when I was 3 or 4 I didn't want to be in jail again. I didn't know what 'jail' meant. I always felt guilty for some reason, and ashamed of myself, yet, I couldn't pinpoint why.

&amp;#x200B;

 I also have this fear of going into a rage suddenly and hurting people. I looked up details since morbid curiosity got the better of me again and when I did I got an article about a murderer. What freaked me the fuck out was the eyes, since people always said my eyes look different to everyone else's in the family. Sparing the details this guy was a 30 year old serial child rapist and murderer. The child he raped was an employee of his. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just hoping to god there's another person who fits those details and wasn't the guy I just mentioned. If there is, then I'd like to know because every time I google those details, it always leads me to this monster. 

&amp;#x200B;

I vividly remember killing a girl who was either 13 or 14 and she said no but I attacked her. I remember desperately trying to pin the case on a black man. I remember being hung by a lynch mob. As a child I had memories of being hung some time in the early 20th century, for killing a girl called 'Mary'. I did PL regression and my PL name was Frank.

,Thetruthishere,"My boyfriend at the time rented a house with two other roommates. His room was an attic converted into a nice large bedroom. A small staircase in the living room, maybe 5 steps, led up to a folding closet door where the stairs continued up to the attic. The staircase creaked loudly when walking up it and the folding door had wooden slats that let light shine through; it was also squeaky when opening and closing. Since this was the only door to his room, there was little privacy and I found it difficult to sleep when his roommates had friends over to party. So he built a door at the top of the staircase. It was a wooden door that was cut specifically to fit the space because the top needed to be cut at an angle to fully enclose the space opening to the staircase. It had a hinge and a latch to lock it on the attic side. One night we were sleeping and I was awakened by a loud knock, as if someone punched the latched door—but then it persisted about 8 more times with a second or so between each knock until the door was knocked off its hinge and fell forward into the attic. While this was happening, I patted my boyfriend’s arm to wake him up but couldn’t wake him up and then I was so scared that I hid under the blankets—which is hilarious because I’m a horror movie fan and am always like ‘c’mon do people even do that?’ A minute or so after I heard the door collapse onto the bedroom floor, I looked to see if anything was there and could now see the bedroom was slightly illuminated by the living room light coming through the folding door’s slats.

,Thetruthishere,"So at the age of 6 I was taken out of my mothers home and had trauma. Moved in with grandparents and the day I moved in I was walking up the stairs and saw something. It was a tall figure, glowing with a spectacular aura of gleaming gold, wearing a long draping robe with a sash and harmonizing to one pitch.

As i mentioned before I saw a figure with light surrounding it, draped in white clothes and a cuirass / sash going from top left shoulder to the waist and wrapping back around. Since then I’ve had multiple dreams of this exact figure. It’s appeared in different forms but the sash and the glow stay the same. Sometimes, and I say this at the risk of sounding like a loon, but often times when seeing this figure in my dreams it would be cause of deja vu later in the day / week (acting as a premonition of sorts). For example one night, at 8 years old, i saw the figure as if i was five inches away from a staticky television and then the channel changed to me at the playground talking about betting what our scores would be on the test. In the dream vision, i saw the figure again and saw our test scores and me guessing it right - following up with “i cant believe i knew it!”. I then woke up and went about doing exactly what happened in the dream and it went exactly as pictured with the same scores. it’s happened a multitude of times but less and less as i age. any ideas of what this could have been and if it has any significant meaning to my subconscious / on a different level?",t2_33y5t2zx,False,,0,False,An Angel?

Sometimes, and I say this at the risk of sounding like a loon, but often times when seeing this figure in my dreams it would be cause of deja vu later in the day / week (acting as a premonition of sorts). For example one night, at 8 years old, i saw the figure as if i was five inches away from a staticky television and then the channel changed to me at the playground talking about betting what our scores would be on the test. In the dream vision, i saw the figure again and saw our test scores and me guessing it right - following up with “i cant believe i knew it!”. I then woke up and went about doing exactly what happened in the dream and it went exactly as pictured with the same scores. it’s happened a multitude of times but less and less as i age. any ideas of what this could have been and if it has any significant meaning to my subconscious / on a different level?&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"I'd like to share this experience and read some of your thoughts and opinions on this.

Since I was a kid, I occasionally had feeling that something is in the room with me, that something is watching me and wants to hurt me. I'm sure everyone who had sleep paralysis or seen shadow people knows the feeling. The only problem is, it wasn't when I was sleeping or just woke up. It was always when fully awake, usually at night and when laying on the bed but occasionally even during the day when walking around.

I always had a theory that these things feed on your fear, if you don't fear them they aren't attracted to you. Yes, I know that many people believe that science fully explains sleep paralysis and this is just hallucinations etc. I'm not one of those people. Ok I'll get to the point.

When I was around 18 (Im in 20s now), I tried a thing called Gates of hades - I-doser (binaural beat program - different songs are supposed to induce specific state of mind). It was supposed to scare you. A tutorial somewhere said to lie down and put a cloth or something over your eyes to make it work. It's 30 min long, after about 25 minutes I realized my body is paralyzed and I felt the evil presence in my room with me again, this time it was really powerful and I had a strong feeling that it was going to kill me and I thought I was going to die. 

I did not fall asleep, I was fully conscious and I managed to turn off the song after few minutes. I did not actually see anything because of the cloth over my eyes, yeah, probably disappointing to you guys. 

I thought it was the song (gates of hades) at the time but I tried it few times later (I'm too curious not to) and it never worked again. The ""official"" opinion is that it is a placebo. Maybe, maybe not. 

Since then, I've had sleep paralysis often but I never saw anything, never felt even a little scared and had no hallucinations or fear at all. It's been probably like 7+ years.

My question is, how could I have sleep paralysis-like experiences while being totally awake. The science fails to explain this. Other times I mentioned there was no way I could have fallen asleep without knowing as I was walking, even running and doing things.

&lt;p&gt;Since I was a kid, I occasionally had feeling that something is in the room with me, that something is watching me and wants to hurt me. I&amp;#39;m sure everyone who had sleep paralysis or seen shadow people knows the feeling. The only problem is, it wasn&amp;#39;t when I was sleeping or just woke up. It was always when fully awake, usually at night and when laying on the bed but occasionally even during the day when walking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always had a theory that these things feed on your fear, if you don&amp;#39;t fear them they aren&amp;#39;t attracted to you. Yes, I know that many people believe that science fully explains sleep paralysis and this is just hallucinations etc. I&amp;#39;m not one of those people. Ok I&amp;#39;ll get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was around 18 (Im in 20s now), I tried a thing called Gates of hades - I-doser (binaural beat program - different songs are supposed to induce specific state of mind). It was supposed to scare you. A tutorial somewhere said to lie down and put a cloth or something over your eyes to make it work. It&amp;#39;s 30 min long, after about 25 minutes I realized my body is paralyzed and I felt the evil presence in my room with me again, this time it was really powerful and I had a strong feeling that it was going to kill me and I thought I was going to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not fall asleep, I was fully conscious and I managed to turn off the song after few minutes. I did not actually see anything because of the cloth over my eyes, yeah, probably disappointing to you guys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was the song (gates of hades) at the time but I tried it few times later (I&amp;#39;m too curious not to) and it never worked again. The &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; opinion is that it is a placebo. Maybe, maybe not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#39;ve had sleep paralysis often but I never saw anything, never felt even a little scared and had no hallucinations or fear at all. It&amp;#39;s been probably like 7+ years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, how could I have sleep paralysis-like experiences while being totally awake. The science fails to explain this. Other times I mentioned there was no way I could have fallen asleep without knowing as I was walking, even running and doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long text, this is my first post here. Not sure if I broke any rules too.&lt;/p&gt;

Background info:

Im male, 27. In May 2019 I had what I call a spiritual awakening through meditation alone. I saw the synchronicity in everything, became very spiritual and philosophical, had 'the knowing', and thought I was from the christ soul group. Kept running into people who I thought had 'the knowing', and we would disagree on nothing. I thought we were some sort of 'gods', but at the same time felt like they were all better people than myself. I felt like I finally understood that we are beings of light, and everything is made up of light.

The only downside was that I wasn't sleeping at all! This worried my family the most, which lead to them taking me to the hospital who sent me to the psych ward. I spent 2 weeks in one psych ward, spent 3 days on the outside, then another 2 weeks in another psych ward. I was given all sorts of antipsychotics until I was finally a vegetable. The psychiatrist saw my silence as great improvement!

Taking antipsychotics was the worst mistake of my life. I stopped in august, and it took me a long time to start feeling normal again. And I promised myself I would never take them again. I would rather be dead or crazy. Silent, emotionless, existing but not living. 

Fast forward to last thursday. 

I started meditating again because I thought it may help speed up the healing process. About 20 minutes into it and I can feel this presence hovering around my head. With my eyes closed I could see an orbital form, and this entity has some sort of gravitational push or pull.

This was my first contact ever with a spiritual entity. I started trying to ask it questions like what's their name, where are they from, why are you here, etc. But I wasn't really getting any responses mentally. I suppose my visual and auditory psych centers aren't very strong. I could just feel them. I asked if they were male or female, and then I felt this very powerful female energy. I made me chuckle a bit for some reason. Later on a thought came through that said ""60% chance you will die"". I opened my eyes wide a grasped the couch behind me with my hands. Heart was racing. Then another thought came ""calm down"". So another hour goes by and I guess they were trying to gain my trust in this tine by sending me love vibrations and peaceful energy. It felt amazing, but then she tried to enter my stomach and it was pinching a little. I told her to stop and she wouldn't. Fear took over and I jumped out my seat and ran upstairs to my bedroom. 

I was hoping she would stay put, but she followed me all the way to my room! She kept trying to stop me from moving by throwing her energy to my feet. It didn't hurt, it just felt strange like there was extra gravity pulling me down. So I make it to my room and my son is sleeping in my bed. I grab the covers and put them over my head and cover my son too. The entity didn't care about any of that. It kept zapping my body and making it shake, and even made my son's legs and arms shake. Then it starts touching me sexually for a little while. After I calm down it starts trying to enter my stomach again. So I roll over on top of my stomach and went to sleep. 

The next morning I sent my son off to school and went to go meditate again. Sure enough the entity returns, gains my trust through feelings again, and then tries to enter my stomach. This time I let it. It crawls around my stomach for 15 minutes or so before it comes around. My stomach is making weird noises.

I think it cleared some sort of blockage because I was shitting like crazy for the next 3 days. Perhaps this had to do with the ""60% chance you die"" thing?

Meditated later that day, nothing. Meditated Saturday and Sunday, nothing. On Monday night (yesterday) I meditate and a entity shows up again. Can't say if it's the same one or not since I can't really talk to it. It starts poking around in my head for 6 hours. From 10pm to 4am. Prodding and zapping, making my arms or legs move randomly, and giving me all sorts of strange sensations inside my head. It didn't hurt or feel good. It allowed me to have a bathroom, water, and even a vape break during this time. If I started feeling fear, it would send love energy to me to calm me down. Halfway through it had me lay down. 

This has been the strangest phenomena I've ever encountered. I think a spiritual entity performed brain surgery on me last night. LOL. I'll update if more happens.

&amp;#x200B;

After my experience in December I had found that my mental state no longer aligned with the ethics of my profession. I was an Infantryman, closing within and destroying the enemy in close combat was something we all strove for. To understand this story a little background on myself is necessary. 

When I first joined the Army, my motivation for combat came from a place of anger, confusion, and personal turmoil. My father raised me with violence, but I allowed his actions to affect and define my character. From 13 I begun to self-medicate, with anything I could find. From weed and alcohol to pills, mdma, and psychedelics. My junior year of high-school I voluntarily withdrew to attend rehab for an extended Xanax habit.  I spent my 17th birthday in a rehab facility in east Texas.  At 19 I graduated and joined the Airborne Infantry, I believed I had found my true calling and an outlet for my aggression. 

Unfortunately for me at the time, going to war is not a decision made by young privates. After a year of a training my brigade was placed on GRF (global response force), which was at the time, a yearlong sentence to garrison life. I had found no glory or bloodshed, Instead boredom and bureaucracy. 

I expected war, and I received weekend staff duties and tactical laser tag. So, I turned to an old enjoyment of mine, drugs. Due to persistent drug tests in the military I stayed away from most narcotics. LSD and mushrooms became my drugs of choice, considering psychedelics are not tested for with normal drug tests. I began to push the limits of reality further and further. I loved raving, taking high doses of acid and dancing my ass off to EDM became a consistent hobby of mine. Eventually we were slotted for a deployment, we were going to Kandahar. Finally, my goal was in sight. Although our deployment was still about 9 months away. Fuck that, no reason to stop taking psychedelics, it was enjoyable and an excellent way to pass the time. Even with the extensive use of psychedelics I still retained my jaded mentality. My psychedelic usage culminated in December of 2016, when my consciousness disconnected from my physical form and was pulled back into a transcendental state in which I was given a glimpse into the world beyond.    

After returning from the other side, I found my headspace to be completely different.  The newly found empathy and love gave me a positive purpose and direction. I was amazed at the information I had been blessed with. I witnessed firsthand that there was something beyond this life, although more than seeing it, I had FELT it. It was the deepest self-reflection I had ever experienced, and after, I found I no longer had the gall to take human life. And here laid my moral dilemma. 

Our deployment to Kandahar was slotted for the summer of 2017. I was a team leader, an assistant gunner to be exact. I oversaw a machine gun team, which is a crucial part of the infantry platoon. The responsibility of my position weighed on me. 

Although I knew everything about the war was wrong. It used to have never bothered me, for I didn’t care about the military industrial complex profiting off the war. In my old mindset I only cared about satisfying my desires for violence. After my experience, I couldn’t even fathom killing another human. For I knew it is inherently wrong. 

Honestly though it was embarrassment that made me decide to revert to my old ways. I killed the good that was fostered inside of me, out of the fear of embarrassment. As Tim O’Brian said in *The Things They Carry*, “I would go to the war—I would kill and maybe die— because I was embarrassed not to.” 

I now empathize with Mr. O’Brian. For I too was a coward; I knew it was wrong and I decided to go to war. (O’Brian, TTTC, pg. 57,58) 

Changing my mindset wasn’t difficult. If you understand that the universe is mental, and that thoughts control our world, nothing is impossible. Not using psychedelics anymore was also useful in reverting my ways of thought. 

Now, this is where the story really begins. It was early June 2017, I was on pre-deployment leave in my hometown of Santa Monica, CA. My parents were living in Italy at the time, so I had decided to spend my leave in California with my aunt and my friends. 

My aunt owned a successful escrow business in Santa Monica, she lived in a beautiful condo at the corner of Ocean and California, overlooking the pacific. She spoiled the fuck out of me while I was there considering I was about to deploy. 

I had been on leave for at least a week when the incident occurred. I was watching T.V. with my aunt while having a glass of Dom Perignon (she bought that shit like water). I had exactly one glass, and that was it. My aunt was tired, and she went to bed. Even thought I was tired, and I had a bedroom to sleep in, I remained on the couch. I felt incredibly comfortable on the couch, so I decided to just lie on my back and slip into slumber. I fell asleep almost instantaneously. 

What woke me was unexpected. My arm had fallen off the open side of the couch. And I felt something licking it. Like a small dog. My aunt had a cat, but the licking was incessant and didn’t feel like the rough tongue of a feline. I rose from the couch to view it. 

It was a small dog, it looked akin to a miniature schnauzer. Except for one defining feature.

It had no skin. 

The creature hurried away as I rose from the couch. After standing up I had noticed, that my blanket was still on the couch and had not fallen off when I stood up. But the blanket looked larger than I remembered, more puffed up like there was a mass of something under it. 

It finally registered, the mass was me, I was under the blanket. 

That moment I realized I was separated from my body; although my attention was drawn by something across the room. It was the skinned dog hurrying into the dining room. I followed it. 

When I reached the dining room, I immediately noticed her. 

At first, she was standing. she stood at about 5’7 was lanky, with long white hair, and endless wrinkles going down her grey skin. She crouched down behind the table when she saw me. She looked like a Hagraven from Skyrim. 

As creepy as this all might sound, fear was not my first instinct. After my experience in December, I was more interested than afraid. I had done research about spirits and entities since then, and I was fully aware that I was responsible for letting them affect me. My thoughts and energy kept me safe and as approached the woman. I walked to the same side of the table as her. She scuttled away into the corner of the room as I approached. 

I chuckled and was pretentiously impressed at the strength of my astral form. I was ready to test my limits. Remembering my research on lucid dreaming, I wanted to attempt to create things in my astral form. I could have tried a million different things. I could have tried flying around Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean.

But no, I was still fucked in the head. I decided to create two humans. And a pistol, so I could kill them. I was psyched up for deployment. All I wanted to do was get my first kill. So why not do a test run? All it took was the thought. I thought it and it transpired. I created two men dressed in suits. And a Glock 19 in my hand. I fired two rounds into each man, center mass. 

Immediately my vision went white. Blindingly so. Like a flashbang in Call of Duty. I heard a voice, a loud but calm and familiar voice. All it said was “You can’t kill people in lucid dreams!” “You’re not supposed to do it!”

Instantly I snapped back into my body. It was 7:30 am, the sun was up, and my aunt was cooking breakfast. I walked into the kitchen and saw her cooking something. I was famished, and happy to finally be awake from my lucid dream. She asked me if Id like breakfast. I attempted to respond. 

I couldn’t speak. 

She asked again. 

I tried again, no change. 

I put my hand to my mouth only to realize that I HAD NO MOUTH. I started to violently shake and vibrate my vocal cords in an intense muffled scream. 

And then I awoke, for real this time. I was back on the couch, it was dark. I sat up and looked at the clock on the DVR. 

It was 3:33 AM. The hour of the devil.

I understood the significance of the time and returned to sleep hastily. I left Los Angeles a week later. 

I went to Afghanistan in late June. I saw combat, but I never killed anyone. (but not for the lack of trying) I returned in 2018, and with a year left on my contract I began to prepare for my new life. I resumed using psychedelics, but in a more responsible manner. My introspective trips re kindled my positive mindset. More importantly though I found love. I met her in the summer of 2018, now we are married. I am now pursing a degree in philosophy, with the goal of spreading the truth of my message; We are more than corporal mass, we are eternal beings. This reality is medium for our spirit to learn and grow.",t2_2qfg04h0,False,,0,False,My experience on the other side pt.2,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,dis,0,False,t3_eyjmqg,False,dark,,public,167,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion/Advice,False,167,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580815856.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to pt. 1  &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/equcii/my_experience_on_the_other_side/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/equcii/my_experience_on_the_other_side/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning from the other side, I found my headspace to be completely different.  The newly found empathy and love gave me a positive purpose and direction. I was amazed at the information I had been blessed with. I witnessed firsthand that there was something beyond this life, although more than seeing it, I had FELT it. It was the deepest self-reflection I had ever experienced, and after, I found I no longer had the gall to take human life. And here laid my moral dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our deployment to Kandahar was slotted for the summer of 2017. I was a team leader, an assistant gunner to be exact. I oversaw a machine gun team, which is a crucial part of the infantry platoon. The responsibility of my position weighed on me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I knew everything about the war was wrong. It used to have never bothered me, for I didn’t care about the military industrial complex profiting off the war. In my old mindset I only cared about satisfying my desires for violence. After my experience, I couldn’t even fathom killing another human. For I knew it is inherently wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly though it was embarrassment that made me decide to revert to my old ways. I killed the good that was fostered inside of me, out of the fear of embarrassment. As Tim O’Brian said in &lt;em&gt;The Things They Carry&lt;/em&gt;, “I would go to the war—I would kill and maybe die— because I was embarrassed not to.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now empathize with Mr. O’Brian. For I too was a coward; I knew it was wrong and I decided to go to war. (O’Brian, TTTC, pg. 57,58) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing my mindset wasn’t difficult. If you understand that the universe is mental, and that thoughts control our world, nothing is impossible. Not using psychedelics anymore was also useful in reverting my ways of thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is where the story really begins. It was early June 2017, I was on pre-deployment leave in my hometown of Santa Monica, CA. My parents were living in Italy at the time, so I had decided to spend my leave in California with my aunt and my friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aunt owned a successful escrow business in Santa Monica, she lived in a beautiful condo at the corner of Ocean and California, overlooking the pacific. She spoiled the fuck out of me while I was there considering I was about to deploy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been on leave for at least a week when the incident occurred. I was watching T.V. with my aunt while having a glass of Dom Perignon (she bought that shit like water). I had exactly one glass, and that was it. My aunt was tired, and she went to bed. Even thought I was tired, and I had a bedroom to sleep in, I remained on the couch. I felt incredibly comfortable on the couch, so I decided to just lie on my back and slip into slumber. I fell asleep almost instantaneously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What woke me was unexpected. My arm had fallen off the open side of the couch. And I felt something licking it. Like a small dog. My aunt had a cat, but the licking was incessant and didn’t feel like the rough tongue of a feline. I rose from the couch to view it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a small dog, it looked akin to a miniature schnauzer. Except for one defining feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had no skin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature hurried away as I rose from the couch. After standing up I had noticed, that my blanket was still on the couch and had not fallen off when I stood up. But the blanket looked larger than I remembered, more puffed up like there was a mass of something under it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It finally registered, the mass was me, I was under the blanket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That moment I realized I was separated from my body; although my attention was drawn by something across the room. It was the skinned dog hurrying into the dining room. I followed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I reached the dining room, I immediately noticed her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, she was standing. she stood at about 5’7 was lanky, with long white hair, and endless wrinkles going down her grey skin. She crouched down behind the table when she saw me. She looked like a Hagraven from Skyrim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As creepy as this all might sound, fear was not my first instinct. After my experience in December, I was more interested than afraid. I had done research about spirits and entities since then, and I was fully aware that I was responsible for letting them affect me. My thoughts and energy kept me safe and as approached the woman. I walked to the same side of the table as her. She scuttled away into the corner of the room as I approached. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chuckled and was pretentiously impressed at the strength of my astral form. I was ready to test my limits. Remembering my research on lucid dreaming, I wanted to attempt to create things in my astral form. I could have tried a million different things. I could have tried flying around Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no, I was still fucked in the head. I decided to create two humans. And a pistol, so I could kill them. I was psyched up for deployment. All I wanted to do was get my first kill. So why not do a test run? All it took was the thought. I thought it and it transpired. I created two men dressed in suits. And a Glock 19 in my hand. I fired two rounds into each man, center mass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately my vision went white. Blindingly so. Like a flashbang in Call of Duty. I heard a voice, a loud but calm and familiar voice. All it said was “You can’t kill people in lucid dreams!” “You’re not supposed to do it!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instantly I snapped back into my body. It was 7:30 am, the sun was up, and my aunt was cooking breakfast. I walked into the kitchen and saw her cooking something. I was famished, and happy to finally be awake from my lucid dream. She asked me if Id like breakfast. I attempted to respond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She asked again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried again, no change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put my hand to my mouth only to realize that I HAD NO MOUTH. I started to violently shake and vibrate my vocal cords in an intense muffled scream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I awoke, for real this time. I was back on the couch, it was dark. I sat up and looked at the clock on the DVR. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 3:33 AM. The hour of the devil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understood the significance of the time and returned to sleep hastily. I left Los Angeles a week later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Afghanistan in late June. I saw combat, but I never killed anyone. (but not for the lack of trying) I returned in 2018, and with a year left on my contract I began to prepare for my new life. I resumed using psychedelics, but in a more responsible manner. My introspective trips re kindled my positive mindset. More importantly though I found love. I met her in the summer of 2018, now we are married. I am now pursing a degree in philosophy, with the goal of spreading the truth of my message; We are more than corporal mass, we are eternal beings. This reality is medium for our spirit to learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't that far, but I need to walk over a bridge to get there and that particular bridge had over a dozen of haunting paranormal stories.

The bridge was just old wooden planks nailed together and it's slightly dangerous because it's old, moldy and just over a meter in width.

Of course, there was no one outside anymore because the people here believed that there was a ghost who pushes anyone who tries to cross the bridge after 10pm towards the lake at the bottom.

But I wasn't that much superstitious so I just walked over to that bridge.

The creepy thing is, the bridge had this sharp turning corner to give way to a house and the hauntings are said to usually occur in that spot.

I was chatting with my cousin on my phone but I stopped when I was about to step on the bridge.

I looked up and I swear I almost screamed loudly.

I saw this small child not far away from me, standing on the exact turning corner of the bridge.

She was wearing a white dress, had long black hair and pitch black eyes.

I had my glasses on and it was a full moon, so I was more than sure that the white part in her eyes were missing. There were just two black voids.

The child started to walk towards me, so I ran back towards the direction that I came from.

When I looked behind me, she was gone.

I just returned home that night and told my cousin what happened.

She too was scared because three of our childhood friends experienced being pushed over that bridge long ago. She thinks that that child is the one at fault.

What do you guys think? Have you guys ever experienced anything like this?

,Thetruthishere," This may be the strangest and most terrifying thing I have experienced while doing urban exploration. 

We (There were two of us) were in the abandoned metro of Rochester, New York, filming a documentary on it. At one point, we heard a voice echoing through the concrete corridor. At first it sounded like a woman calling for a friend, but what she was saying was unintelligible. We assumed she was calling out for a friend, so we kept walking. Heard nothing for a few seconds but then it started up again. This time it sounded closer and stranger. Still nonsense, but no longer like she was calling for a friend- more like she was yelling at someone. Us, maybe. Then a light appeared from one of the pillars. As soon as we turned off ours, the light was gone. There was no voice after that, and no light, or sound at all. No sound of someone running or walking away or anything. We didn't think much of it at the time, but things get stranger while I was editing the video. 

So the light appeared relatively close to us, maybe 100 or 150 meters away. This was close to an open manhole cover that led into an old brick sewer that we found. It looked like it was recently open, and although we didn't entertain the notion at the time, this woman may have gone down their after we spooked her. 

It is also possible that she hid and waited for us to leave, or was following us. I had a feeling we were being watched and kept checking behind me the whole time we were down there. That doesn't prove that she was following us, but it is certainly odd. I have been to abandoned hospitals and high schools and rarely have I had this feeling. 

After the documentary was uploaded a few people I know tried to decipher what she was saying but it sounded like nonsense. I don't think this was anything paranormal, but the whole thing was just weird. Like, if it was just a squatter or homeless person we would know. We would have heard them running or hiding or they would have tried to scare us away or something.

,Thetruthishere,"Backstory: My Dog, Baxter, recently passed away from stomach cancer. The vet told my family he was going to live another 3 months, but passed away a few days later (November 3rd to be exact). He was a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, and was 13.

I remember laying in bed crying. He used to lay beside me and protect me. I trusted him to keep watch, which he did, and I would hug him if I heard a noise. When I was laying on the left side of the bed, I had a vision of him laying on the bed. He was black and white, and glowing. He looked peaceful as he lay.

After his death, I’ve had a couple dreams of him, which I thought was significant.

Story 1: It was a beautiful day outside, and I was with my mom, who was washing the dishes and looking outside. That’s when I peer through the window and noticed a brown figure dash across the grass “BAXTER!” I thought. I ran downstairs and opened the door. Low and behold, he dashes right through the door. He scurries up the steps and started running around, as if he was glad to see my mom (Who he was very attached too, before he passed away). I looked at my mom “Mom! Look! He’s back!” She didn’t notice him or acknowledged his presence. She just looked out the window. I realized that he was a ghost, as though, he hijacked my dream. He played around for a second, played some quick fetch and then, he disappeared.

Context for Story 2: 
Me and my family are expecting a puppy this may, and so I was worried that if baxter were alive today, would he approve of my family getting a dog?

Story 2:

It was one of those dreams at the end, where it was celebratory, like ending and nightmare or story of a dream. The party was on, and I look at a rock, and notice Baxter sitting upon it, looking down, his mouth in the smiling position, and he was panting a little bit. I walk up to him, and then look down at my side, and I see the specific dog breed my family was going to buy. I look up at Baxter, and he is still smiling. I thought he would be upset that we were replacing him, but he looked happy. I knew, he was trying to say that he accepts my family of getting a new dog. I put my hand on his fur, and strangely, It had the same fluffy texture he had before he died. It looked like it was glowing, I rubbed his fur, remembering what it felt like, before I put my hand on his face, and waking up from my dream. 

Keep in mind, these were dreams, so I might have just made it up in my mind in my dream, but all felt real.

,Thetruthishere,"This happened a few years ago, but I was reminded of it today after watching a hiking vlog.
I was on the return leg of an overnight hike, on a rough track cut through thick scrubby forest. It was a warm, sunny afternoon with no wind, and I was almost drowsy.
There was the sound of children's voices ahead, a bit too far away to be distinct. I thought this was odd, as it was a couple hours walk from the road-end and they sounded fairly young.
It was the usual sort of fitful kid's conversation, and although it got louder as I got closer, I still couldn't quite distinguish the words. The talking died down and ended completely when I was almost on top of them.
There I got a shock. Where I thought the children were was not the track. It was a steep, thickly wooded gully, with a trickle of water at the bottom just visible through the scrub. This was terrain I would go well out of my way to avoid. I was confused because the children hadn't sounded panic stricken and surely they'd never go down there intentionally. 
I called out and pushed in a way, but there was no response. I lost a bit of skin looking around, and eventually guiltily gave up the search.

,Thetruthishere,"Hey all, I have quite a story to tell. Believe or don’t, this is my story.

Some backstory, Me and a friend were involved in the occult. I was just interested in learning of it, he was interested in acting in it, we’ll call him Matt. 

I’ve left a comment about Matt here before, but I’ll repeat it, summarized... Mainly because only about three people actually read that. Matt and I played a game about making bets with an entity, if you win you win whatever you made a bet for, if you lose, the entity wins the exact opposite, I.E. If you bet for love, and you lose, you’ll find yourself alone. If you win the the entity will help you find love.

You played this game with a two cups and two die, one on either side of any board game board, we used a life board. You put a die with the cup sitting straight up, you make your “bet” or “deal” or “negotiation” I don’t know what to call it, you basically make a wish, and call upon the entity to play you. Then you flip your cup and walk out of the pitch dark room. Once you call upon the entity if everything is set up correctly, you’ll know it’s there. You’ll feel it’s presence. A kind of feeling that fills you with awe and dread, makes you want to not turn your back but on it but run in the opposite direction. You’ll wait a few minutes and it’ll play it’s turn. You WILL hear the die in the cup flip, no matter where you are in the house. That’s how you know it’s played. You go back in the room and if your roll is higher than the entities roll, you win and vise versa. If you are done playing, and no one else wants to play, you salt and destroy the die or ensure no one will ever find it again. You cannot play this game twice in a row, only once a week, but multiple people can play, making their own wishes. (One by one of course). This entity is Game Master of sorts, and it doesn’t back down from a good game of chance. Just be respectful and it’ll be fair.

Matt had lost some fairly expensive jewelry and wanted to bet those, he lost his bet, meaning the entity would ensure he would never find them again. Who knows, maybe he’s all pimped out with those rings right now. Matt was pretty upset and asked me to play and ask for the same thing. I read over the rules and didn’t see anything that said not to that and went ahead and reset the board. As soon as I called upon the entity to play, after making the bet, I could feel it. It was there and it was mad. I knew it was angry and I fled the room room, it wanted to hurt me.

Not even a minute later I heard it play. We went back in and the entities die was missing. The rules we found online even said “Warning: if you cannot find the entities die after play, God help you.”

I was scared shitless, not to mention so more spooky stuff happened but that besides the point. Either way we pissed this thing off by double dipping a bet.

So fast forward two weeks, back at Matt’s house. There’s more of us this time, Me, Matt, John, and Chris. (Names changed for obvious reasons) and Matt had been telling us something is in his woods, he told us he doesn’t like to sit outside on his patio past dark because it whispers stuff to him. 

He told us this at one in the morning. All of us being dumb teenagers decided to go off into the woods with only two flashlights, me and John carrying them. I went in last and Matt was leading because he knew of a clearing. The first thing I noticed was how dark it was around us. Trees blotted out the moon and the stars leaving only our flashlights as light.

So we walked about a quarter mile in and found the clearing, all while, every now and then we would hear voices. Little unintelligible voices.

As soon as we reached the clearing, mind you it was still surrounded by forest and not big enough for there to be any light seepage, we heard rustling to our left, somewhere where our light was not. Me and John beamed these big ass semi-spotlights to that area, there was nothing. We heard fast movement behind us, running to us. It sounded like a dog but it was much too heavy. Me and John shined our lights there... There was nothing. At this point we realized, Matt was right. The voices intensified, we all heard them. The things they told me to do was sickening. It was like my own voice but it was an intrusion. I didn’t think it on my own will. It was like hearing a whisper in my own head from my own voice. 

They said stuff like “Bash Matt over the head with the flashlight” and “Go back, check Matt’s closet. Shoot everyone in the house.” Demented stuff like that. The one that still scares me to this day is when I heard “Pour gasoline all over yourself and set yourself on fire” for reasons I’ll get to. That is the first time I’ve ever written down some of the things the voices told me to do. I’m not crazy, I’ve never had a history of schizophrenia, I went into those woods sober as the day I was born. 

I looked at Matt, then John, then Chris. I knew we all heard the evil demands. We had all backed into a circle, me and John covering 180 degrees, however wherever the light was not, the sounds would come from. Grunting, footsteps, scream, but every time we shined our lights from the source, there would be nothing.

Needless to say we ran. We ran so fast. Back the way we came, we didn’t even stay on the make shift trail we ripped through brambles and dodged trees. I exited first, then Chris did, then John. We all caught our breathes at the end of the woods before we noticed Matt was standing still, in the woods. I remember distinctly yelling at Matt to hurry up and get the fuck out of the woods. He looked at me, tears pouring from his eyes and just said no. Me and John weren’t having that so we grabbed him, mind you he tried to run further in. 

We pulled him out and down he went, like a bag of rocks onto the earth. He was out cold. He begun seizing. After he finished his seizure we picked him up and carried him back to his room, terrified. He started walking around again around 4am, we were all still up and scared shitless. Matt had not ever had a seizure before this.

We all went home and agreed not to tell anyone of this. About three to four weeks after this Matt was sent to a psych ward. didn’t get out until a few months had passed. He wasn’t ever the same.

Matt killed himself in those woods, the same way the thing told me to kill myself. Lighting myself on fire. He was only recognized because he wore his class ring when he did the act. 

Without a doubt in my mind, I know we fucked up playing that game. I regret it daily but at the same time I’m somewhat thankful the entity knew I wasn’t to blame. I had a few weird experiences after that game, but nothing that tormented me like the things Matt had told me about. Maybe I’ll write about those sometime. 

As for John and Chris, I still talk to Chris, he’s a good guy. John turned out to be a snake, who did his best to ruin my reputation in one year, we don’t talk. 

Anyway this is my story. Believe it or not, idrc just wanted to share with you guys.

EDIT: I forgot to mention the god-forsaken smell that loomed over us choking our breathes in our lungs. I’ve smelled a squirrel that had died in my shed and had been decaying for weeks, I know what that is but it was worse than that. A combination of putrid smells that made me gag. As if 100 pigs had died in pile of their own shit in a especially hot summer day and were bloated beyond recognition as a pig, there was a touch as if someone pelted the pigs with egg and left that there to cook in the summer’s son. But beyond the absolute putridness of that there was the smell of a campfire. You know when you’ve sat next to a fire for a while and your very skin begins to smell of that flames? Well add that to the mix and yet *still* it’s missing a special ingredient that made it all the much more worse. There was a smell of blood, an iron smell and that I often smell after a nose bleed, and wait there’s more, sweat. There was a part that smelled like body oder of a man who ran 10 miles and didn’t shower for a week added to the mix. That is what I can best describe this foul smell as.",t2_nohcgc3,False,,0,False,I was stalked,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,4,0,False,t3_exjguy,False,dark,,public,30,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Angels/Demons,False,30,,False,,1580621938.0,,[],{},,True,,1580649167.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I have quite a story to tell.

Matt and I played a game about making bets with an entity, if you win you win whatever you made a bet for, if you lose, the entity wins the exact opposite, I.E. If you bet for love, and you lose, you’ll find yourself alone. If you win the the entity will help you find love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You played this game with a two cups and two die, one on either side of any board game board, we used a life board. You put a die with the cup sitting straight up, you make your “bet” or “deal” or “negotiation” I don’t know what to call it, you basically make a wish, and call upon the entity to play you. Then you flip your cup and walk out of the pitch dark room. Once you call upon the entity if everything is set up correctly, you’ll know it’s there. You’ll feel it’s presence. A kind of feeling that fills you with awe and dread, makes you want to not turn your back but on it but run in the opposite direction. You’ll wait a few minutes and it’ll play it’s turn. You WILL hear the die in the cup flip, no matter where you are in the house. That’s how you know it’s played. You go back in the room and if your roll is higher than the entities roll, you win and vise versa. If you are done playing, and no one else wants to play, you salt and destroy the die or ensure no one will ever find it again. You cannot play this game twice in a row, only once a week, but multiple people can play, making their own wishes. (One by one of course). This entity is Game Master of sorts, and it doesn’t back down from a good game of chance. Just be respectful and it’ll be fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt had lost some fairly expensive jewelry and wanted to bet those, he lost his bet, meaning the entity would ensure he would never find them again. Who knows, maybe he’s all pimped out with those rings right now. Matt was pretty upset and asked me to play and ask for the same thing. I read over the rules and didn’t see anything that said not to that and went ahead and reset the board. As soon as I called upon the entity to play, after making the bet, I could feel it. It was there and it was mad. I knew it was angry and I fled the room room, it wanted to hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even a minute later I heard it play. We went back in and the entities die was missing. The rules we found online even said “Warning: if you cannot find the entities die after play, God help you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scared shitless, not to mention so more spooky stuff happened but that besides the point. Either way we pissed this thing off by double dipping a bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fast forward two weeks, back at Matt’s house. There’s more of us this time, Me, Matt, John, and Chris. (Names changed for obvious reasons) and Matt had been telling us something is in his woods, he told us he doesn’t like to sit outside on his patio past dark because it whispers stuff to him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told us this at one in the morning. All of us being dumb teenagers decided to go off into the woods with only two flashlights, me and John carrying them. I went in last and Matt was leading because he knew of a clearing. The first thing I noticed was how dark it was around us. Trees blotted out the moon and the stars leaving only our flashlights as light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we walked about a quarter mile in and found the clearing, all while, every now and then we would hear voices. Little unintelligible voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we reached the clearing, mind you it was still surrounded by forest and not big enough for there to be any light seepage, we heard rustling to our left, somewhere where our light was not. Me and John beamed these big ass semi-spotlights to that area, there was nothing. We heard fast movement behind us, running to us. It sounded like a dog but it was much too heavy. Me and John shined our lights there... There was nothing. At this point we realized, Matt was right. The voices intensified, we all heard them. The things they told me to do was sickening. It was like my own voice but it was an intrusion. I didn’t think it on my own will. It was like hearing a whisper in my own head from my own voice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said stuff like “Bash Matt over the head with the flashlight” and “Go back, check Matt’s closet. Shoot everyone in the house.” Demented stuff like that. The one that still scares me to this day is when I heard “Pour gasoline all over yourself and set yourself on fire” for reasons I’ll get to. That is the first time I’ve ever written down some of the things the voices told me to do. I’m not crazy, I’ve never had a history of schizophrenia, I went into those woods sober as the day I was born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at Matt, then John, then Chris. I knew we all heard the evil demands. We had all backed into a circle, me and John covering 180 degrees, however wherever the light was not, the sounds would come from. Grunting, footsteps, scream, but every time we shined our lights from the source, there would be nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say we ran. We ran so fast. Back the way we came, we didn’t even stay on the make shift trail we ripped through brambles and dodged trees. I exited first, then Chris did, then John. We all caught our breathes at the end of the woods before we noticed Matt was standing still, in the woods. I remember distinctly yelling at Matt to hurry up and get the fuck out of the woods. He looked at me, tears pouring from his eyes and just said no. Me and John weren’t having that so we grabbed him, mind you he tried to run further in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled him out and down he went, like a bag of rocks onto the earth. He was out cold. He begun seizing. After he finished his seizure we picked him up and carried him back to his room, terrified. He started walking around again around 4am, we were all still up and scared shitless. Matt had not ever had a seizure before this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all went home and agreed not to tell anyone of this. About three to four weeks after this Matt was sent to a psych ward. didn’t get out until a few months had passed. He wasn’t ever the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt killed himself in those woods, the same way the thing told me to kill myself. Lighting myself on fire. He was only recognized because he wore his class ring when he did the act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt in my mind, I know we fucked up playing that game. I regret it daily but at the same time I’m somewhat thankful the entity knew I wasn’t to blame. I had a few weird experiences after that game, but nothing that tormented me like the things Matt had told me about. Maybe I’ll write about those sometime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for John and Chris, I still talk to Chris, he’s a good guy. John turned out to be a snake, who did his best to ruin my reputation in one year, we don’t talk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway this is my story. Believe it or not, idrc just wanted to share with you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I forgot to mention the god-forsaken smell that loomed over us choking our breathes in our lungs. I’ve smelled a squirrel that had died in my shed and had been decaying for weeks, I know what that is but it was worse than that. A combination of putrid smells that made me gag. As if 100 pigs had died in pile of their own shit in a especially hot summer day and were bloated beyond recognition as a pig, there was a touch as if someone pelted the pigs with egg and left that there to cook in the summer’s son. But beyond the absolute putridness of that there was the smell of a campfire. You know when you’ve sat next to a fire for a while and your very skin begins to smell of that flames? Well add that to the mix and yet &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; it’s missing a special ingredient that made it all the much more worse. There was a smell of blood, an iron smell and that I often smell after a nose bleed, and wait there’s more, sweat. There was a part that smelled like body oder of a man who ran 10 miles and didn’t shower for a week added to the mix. That is what I can best describe this foul smell as.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"So every Saturday night, I visit my aunt and uncle for dinner and a movie. One of my favourite things about visiting is seeing their dogs. They have three dogs: a pug named Silas, a groodle named Layla and a golden retriever named Doug. They’ve had Silas for 17 years, whereas Layla is 7 and Doug is 4, so obviously they’re a lot more energetic. Layla and Doug tend to jump on me as soon as I enter the house, whereas Silas just kind of paces the room. In the last year or so, he’s developed a degenerative nerve disorder. You can no longer pet him because if you touch his spine, he’ll collapse. He’s not in a good way. He’s incontinent and almost blind. Sometimes he falls over and can’t get up. Other times he walks into things and gets his head stuck in them. He looks like a little old man and behaves like one too.

So tonight I arrive and I say hello to all the dogs. Silas, Layla and Doug are all standing in the doorway. Silas is just wandering around, minding his own business, while Layla and Doug are running around because they’re excited to see the lady who comes around once a week to give them cuddles and pats and treats. I don’t hear Silas’s paws click-clacking against the hardwood floors when he walks around the room like I usually do but I don’t think much of it. It’s only around dinner time that I make an offhand comment about not having seen him since I arrived.

,Thetruthishere,"This is an experience that seems unbelievable even years later. I was probably 13, so like 7 years ago, in the home I grew up in, which always had a feel that something was there.

I've been babysitting this lovely child for two months now since her parents' business started to grow out. It was just a part-time job since our houses aren't really that far and I was just a Sophomore. She was so adorable and is such a good girl who doesn't really need any special care or attention.

Since she's just two and a half years old, she's just starting to talk. She would babble, gurgle and even giggle by herself whenever she would play with her toys and it was honestly so cute.

One thing that her parents and I immediately noticed was that she started to imitate the words that the people around her were saying.

So whenever I would babysit her, I would also teach her about letters and basic words that she would quickly learn and repeat. It was obvious that she was kind of a smart child.

But her speech slightly got worse as she even imitates curse words that she would accidentally hear. It was hard to get it off of her, but her parents and I somehow did it.

The creepy stuff happened when her parents went out of town for a week and I was in charge of her for a whole day until her grandmother arrived in the night. 

I just finished cooking lunch when she pulled the hem of my shirt. I turned to her and she said:

""Die!""

And then she just ran upstairs.

I was stunned and went to her room to ask her where she learned that word, but then when I opened her door she threw a teddy bear at me, which she never does until now.

""Die, die, die!"" She keeps chanting as it was obvious that she doesn't know what she was talking about or what the word even meant.

I picked her up from the bed and I asked her where she learned that word from. But she just kept chanting ""die!"" for reasons still unknown to me.

I was confused as to how she learned that word and from whom or where.

She was in the living room while I was cooking and there's a large window behind their sofa where she was playing with her toys. It was possible that she could've heard it from outside, but I would've heard it too since their house is fairly small.

The TV was off since she doesn't like to watch anything and the neighbors rarely even fight.

I remember that day being quiet, just like any other day. So it was really confusing where she would pick up that word.

When her grandmother arrived, it was a mystery as to how she stopped saying the annoying word as I tried the whole dang day for her to stop saying it to no avail.

I never told anyone what happened because her parents might get the wrong idea. I would never say anything bad in front of a child, especially this one who keeps repeating one specific word.

,Thetruthishere,"I've always wanted to share this experience with people in order to get feedback, but due to the nature of private and intimate moments that lead to it, it has always stopped me from sharing it with friends and family. Well I cut out the obvious parts when it came to telling my family about it. 

One night around Fall of 2018, my girlfriend and I felt a dark presence in her room that I denied feeling but ended up battling from 2am till sunrise. 

My girlfriend lives at home with her parents in a , recently built well off neighborhood. We are both college students who attend different schools in town but somehow manage to spend everyday and night together. Around november of 2018 both her parents were out of town, at least one of them wouldnt be back for 2 weeks more. So of course I stayed over and we enjoyed ourselves. One night we get home late, I had picked her up from school after a long day and we were ready to shower and head to bed. For whatever reason starting from the drive from her school, my mind could not concentrate on anythiny, and I was getting annoyed. We get the idea of using her parents walk in shower because it was nicer than her restroom. 

We're in the walkin shower, glass panels/door covered in fog as we use the hottest water setting   because women like boiling water. But for whatever reason the restroom still felt cold even as the hot water steamed off our skin. From the corner of my eye, in my peripheral vision I see a shadow move across the floor just outside the shower, I ignore it because it was just the corner of my eye I said. Things get intimate between my girlfriend and I, and suddenly she breaks down crying in the middle of it. I ask her whats wrong and she says she just got overwhelmed with dread. Again I see a shadow in the floor through my peripheral vision, but my focus went back to my girlfriend and my lack of focus. Suddenly within a second of looking away from the glass panel as I tried to figure out the shadow situation I take a look again and all the fog in the glass panels and mirrors is gone, all within a second. .. my girlfriend also noticed it and was intrigued by it but we made no mention  of it till the next day. 

Later that night, for whatever reason we both went to bed upset without saying goodnight to each other. Within an hour I have a nightmare that people(in my dream they were tall gray shadows) had broken in to the house via the garage, and in my dream my girlfriend wouldnt wake up so I ran outside with her on my arms and start yelling for help. My girlfriend then wakes me up because I'm actually sleep talking saying ""help me, help"". 

We both get up and go to her restroom just down the hall, I remove my contacts because I'm an optometrist biggest nuisance, and as we walk back to her room I tell her about my nightmare. She gets spooked after she closes her bedroom and wonders if we closed the garage door after coming home late. I offered to go check it out but she seems frightens and tells me to stay inside, I didnt think much of it and I say fine, I'll check the window and look at the garage. To no surprised everything looks fine. My girlfriend suddenly rushes to bed and ask me to lay down, I do and open my phone. She immediately yanks it away and tells me to fall asleep. 

As soon as I laid to my side to cuddle her, something hits me. A feeling like no other.  I felt something extremely heavy in the atmosphere, specially from outside her room, a feeling of fear and uncertainty. It's completely hard to describe it, if paranormal yet evil was a feeling it was definitely it. To my biggest fear my girlfriend asks me "" do you feel that?"" My heart starts to feel like its about to explode, but I dont want to admit it or make her feel scared and I say, "" I dont feel anything, why dont you pray to help fall asleep."" I had never before told her to pray, and in my head I began to pray "" Our father"" followed by the words ""God bless this house"" in my head. As soon as those words were said that feeling intensified with anger, and again the worst and last thing I wanted to hear from my girlfriend were said, ""I think it just got angry... after praying"" I tell her its nothing but this time I know for a fact that this was not a Godly thing, and we may be in danger, my girlfriend then says ""its going to get worse before it gets better"" and again I insist that I don't feel anything and for her to fall asleep. 

I begin to pray endlessly, reciting "" Our Father "" over and over again, the angry feeling faded but we both felt it was still there, as my girlfriend later described it ""like someone pointing a gun at us only to lower it but not holster it away"", I faintly hear a small whisper saying ""zooh"" or maybe ""azul"" from behind me. My girlfriend again not helping asks ""did you hear that? Sounds like a distant cry"" as I still cuddled well big spooned ky girlfriend as we both faced her door, too frighten to give it our back. She finally dozes off, but I continue praying "" Our Father"" over and over and over again. But at a certain point it felt like what I would start to describe as a demon, began messing with me, mentally, and spiritually. While I prayed, words would get stuck in my mind, the our father which I knew by heart would be warbled in my head but I knew I couldn't stop. I kept praying either finishing it off or starting from the beginning. Behind me again I heard a whisper, but this time mocking me ""help me. Help  me."" I looked over my shoulder and towards the window as I continued praying waiting for sunrise as a feeling inside me reassured me it would be over then. 

Just around 6am before sunrise, even in a half sleep state, I prayed. Till finally I dreamnt and the feeling slightly diminished. I was dreaming I was in the bedroom as if everything was as it were while I slept, I got up from bed and opened the door. Infront of me was a young girl, roughly 4 years old, but in my dream I knew this was a disguise, I knew this was a mischief incarnate, as best as I could describe it. I assertively commanded it to move away and let me and my girlfriend pass. It laughed, I know had my girlfriend behind me for in my dream I wanted to get her to safety. This time when I looked at it again it was no longer a little girl but a mischievous looking demon maybe even shorter than the little girl roughly  3 ft tall. Again I assertively demanded it move away, it was weaker than when we first encountered it that night and in my dream I manage to carry my girlfriend pass the demon and fled the house. 

Finally I awoke in the morning, all feeling was gone. Again we stupidly showered in her moms shower, I rushed us even got upset that we were taking long, my girlfriend said I could leave the shower before her and get dressed but I refused and we finished. I really wanted to talk about that night, but I was scared and was even more reluctant to make her scared. But I knew it was unsafe so as soon as we drove away from her street I brought it up. I told her I felt it, she was surprised and asked what I was talking about. I said I felt what you felt last night, but I didnt want to frighten her. She got very upset that I denied it and we discussed what happened. 

The aftermath of this is just as interesting but its alot to type and I'm at a cafe typing on my phone.  Needless to say we still feel it in her house when her parents are away. 2 or maybe 3 of our mutual friends we've had over have felt it as well just differently.

,Thetruthishere,"If you don't know, I'm somewhat of a goof, and I don't know how many years ago this was, but I know it was around Christmastime (I think) because I was making a spoof of Alvin and the chipmunks when I was in my teen years and I was just in my room one day and the radio randomly came on and a chipmunks song came on and I was like ""what the?""

,Thetruthishere,"So I was hesitant to post this because I'm generally a skeptic, and I'm sure the real explanation is quite mundane; however, it's been bugging me for the last few weeks, and I'm curious to know what other people think about this.

First, some background. A few weeks ago, I was on vacation alone in North Carolina, and was staying at this AirBnB in the middle of nowhere. It was night time, and the area was very dark and remote. Add in the fact that I was, for some reason, watching some creepy ass Nexpo videos on Youtube at the time, and I ended up in a very skittish mood. That being said, even if I wasn't, this experience would have freaked me out. While lying in bed and relaxing I was texting this girl I'm seeing when, suddenly, my phone rang. Now, I generally answer phone calls, even from unknown numbers, if I'm not particularly busy. So, without looking too close at the number I answered the phone and said, ""Hello?"" In response, all I got was crying. By crying, what I really mean is a hysterical bawling. Really all I could pull from the voice was that it was female, and she was clearly troubled. I tried repeating my hello, and asking if she's alright, but all I got was more crying. It lasted about 5 seconds more, then the phone hung up suddenly. 

This absolutely chilled my blood and left me paralyzed with fear. The crying was haunting. I just sat there for awhile, then tried sending a text to the number, but I got an error message which is characteristic of trying to text a land line. It was at that point that I noticed the phone number had the wrong number of digits for a US phone number; however, the number was in my call history in no particular format. Just a sequence of 12 numbers with no dashes anywhere. 

The experience really stuck with me, messing up my groove for the last few days of my vacation. Partly because it was just plain disturbing, but also because I didn't have the courage to call the number back. Honestly, it still leaves me a little uncomfortable at night, even though I am now home and surrounded by people I trust.

,Thetruthishere,"tl;dr —me and a friend found strange mounds in the middle of the forest and then got chased by a man with dogs—

I went hiking with one of my old friends. He used to be homeless and in a bad situation with his parents so I let him stay with me until he got on his feet. 

One evening before he officially started staying, we went to go get his stuff from the woods he was posted up at that night. It’s probably 11pm or midnight when we met up (I had work and got off late), we go to the woods to pick up his stuff and we kind of got lost in the dark. It was abnormally dark considering the full moon was fixing to come around for its phase. Neither of us had flashlights and my phone had died so I couldn’t use that. Bad planning, I’ll admit. 

We stumble across a bunch of decently large mounds of dirt in this offshoot of the woods. Each mound had a small tree growing from the middle and a crude blank sign at the tops. 
At this point it is eerily quiet considering on our way over the woods were insanely loud with cicadas and whatnot. We hear a branch snap nearby while trying to look at these mounds and decide to get back to finding his stuff. 

We eventually found his “campsite” and hurried out. Outside of the woods now, we’re walking down a one way street leading to the main road. A large moving truck comes our way and slowly passes us by. We pay it no mind and just nod and keep going. The truck turns around and pulls around into a little offshoot on our right, stopping parallel to us with the engine on. The driver gets out and just watches us. We weren’t being conspicuous or anything by looking back, just glances over the shoulder here and there. Nothing you could make out in the darkness from the distance he was anyhow. 

We’re almost at the top of the street and to my car when he goes to the back of his truck and I guess opens the back door. The next thing we hear is at least three dogs barking their heads off and a flashlight pointed our way. 

We started running and had to do some evading through nearby neighbourhood streets before we could get back to my car.

,Thetruthishere,"I need to set the scene a little. First things first, I’m not sure if I really believe in ghosts and the paranormal in general, but I’m certainly fascinated by it and always have been. That being said, I only ever had this one experience (knock on wood).

In 2014, I travelled abroad alone for the first time in my life. I was 20 then and was going to spend a week on a Scottish island. Those were also the very first flights I ever took. Now, my grandma was an extremely anxious woman, and a religious woman, so the day before I was to leave for my holiday, she hugged me and gave me a little gold chain with a cross on it. It was to keep me safe, a talisman of sorts. It’s perhaps worth noting that I’m not religious myself, but you best believe I carried that little chain in my wallet all the time.

The following year, 2015, my grandma passed in June. While it was obviously very sad, it was not unexpected, as she was 86 years old and had been badly cancer sick for years. To be honest, I was mostly just relieved that she was finally no longer in pain when she passed away. I do still miss her terribly though.

Now we finally get to the good part. In August 2015, so two months after my grandma died, I travelled to Scotland again, this time with my best friend. Now, my grandma had lived with my aunt in the coziest little house for around 35 years. I LOVE that place and I feel completely at home and at peace when I’m there. It’s an old and kind of dark house, but not creepy at all. When I was 8 or so, my parents built a house right next to it, so my aunt and grandma and us in the other house became neighbors. The day before I would leave for my 2015 holiday, I went over to my aunt to say bye to her. The layout of her house is like this: you walk through the entrance door and you’re in the living room. To the right side is what used to be my grandma’s bedroom, or you can walk straight ahead through a narrow, short corridor, which has doors on the left side to the bathroom and to a little pantry. When you walk through the corridor, you reach a sort of dining room. Between the corridor and the dining room, there’s an old wooden door. It’s painted white, and it has a thick panel of opaque glass in it (am I making sense? English is my second language).

On that evening, the moment I set foot in the dining room, I heard three knocks on that glass panel, in rapid succession. It sounded exactly like someone tapping the glass with their fingernail.

Now, I’m aware that there’s probably a rational explanation for this. It’s an old wooden door, it creaks and such, or maybe me planting my foot in the dining room sent vibrations through the floor which caused the old door to make that sound. But please, bear in mind that over the course of 20 years, I walked through that door almost every. Single. Day. Thousands of times, and it never ONCE made a sound anything close to this, and it hasn’t since. Nor did I ever hear it make that sound when someone else walked through, which, again, I witnessed thousands of times. So, the door made a sound that somehow sounded exactly like a fingernail tapping the glass panel rapidly three times, which had never happened before and has never happened since, on the eve of my departing for a holiday abroad? You be the judge of how likely that sounds, but those are some coincidences.

After the incident, I was a little spooked, but not scared. It was immediately evident to me that it was just my grandma wishing me a good journey and asking me to be careful. Note that I’m usually a skeptic, albeit interested in the paranormal, and I do not believe in life after death.

(Un)fortunately, that’s the only experience I ever had. However, my aunt has more stories. Now, my aunt is not one to make up stories. She’s not the creative type, but she’s a very direct, no-bullshit kind of person, very independent and tough as nails. I have never ever seen her shed a tear, not even when grandma died. She’s just not a very outwardly emotional person. I love her very much and I have no reason to disbelieve her. She told me that she would often catch a whiff of my grandma’s perfume coming from what used to be her bedroom. She said the scent was particularly strong in the evening, when my grandma used to sit in the living room and watch TV. One night, my aunt was in her bedroom, when she heard knocking on the wall from my grandma’s room (their rooms are adjacent to one another), just like grandma used to do towards the end when she had already become bed-ridden and needed something from my aunt. The most incredibly experience (told to me by my aunt completely casually, as if it isn’t the coolest and creepiest thing ever) was one night when my aunt was again sitting in her room, when she started hearing knocking sounds coming from the direction of the bathroom. The sound moved from the bathroom to the pantry, then to the dining room, and finally to the kitchen which is right next to my aunt‘s room. So there’s this knocking that sounds like it’s coming from inside the cupboards, some banging from the pans in there or whatever, and it’s moving ever closer to her, so what does my aunt do? She yells „Goddamnit mom, I know you’re here! Stop being creepy!“ — silence. The sound is gone and does not start up again. This part always makes me laugh because who yells at their dead mom‘s ghost? My aunt, that’s who.

Over the years, my aunt has had a few more minor experiences, mostly the scent of perfume. It stopped when she got rid of the TV in the living room. Then, in December of 2018, an aneurysm burst in my aunt’s head. She came very, very close to dying. If my dad had not miraculously found her after just a few minutes, she would have died on the spot. She was in a coma for weeks, developed pneumonia, the works. She’s also in her 50’s, a heavy smoker and just not in great shape. So basically, the doctors told us it’s not looking very good. But my aunt pulled through and gradually got better and better. Today, she’s completely recovered and 100 % back to her own self. A few weeks after she woke up from her coma, she told us that when she was still in the coma, she had talked to my grandma who had told her it’s not her time to go yet. My aunt now is completely, steadfastly convinced that my grandma is her guardian angel who made my dad find my aunt on the floor and administer first aid and save her life.

So, that’s it. Make of that what you will! I know I don’t understand it. It’s difficult to reconcile when your own personal experience and that of loved one‘s you have no reason not to believe clashes with what you perceive as reality. For me, that means that while I do not believe in any kind of god, nor in the afterlife, and I’m unconvinced about ghosts and paranormal stuff like that, I myself have experienced something I cannot easily explain, as had my aunt who I believe fully and would trust with my life. And the funny thing is, most people you talk to have some kind of ghost story, don’t they? Each of my parents does, my buddy in the office does, and I know of so many others. Let’s not even go into the stories my in-laws from Vietnam have. Ghosts and such are a completely normal part of life there, especially for the older generation. Talk to any older Vietnamese person, and I guarantee they have at least one incredible story.

It’s an old and kind of dark house, but not creepy at all. When I was 8 or so, my parents built a house right next to it, so my aunt and grandma and us in the other house became neighbors. The day before I would leave for my 2015 holiday, I went over to my aunt to say bye to her. The layout of her house is like this: you walk through the entrance door and you’re in the living room. To the right side is what used to be my grandma’s bedroom, or you can walk straight ahead through a narrow, short corridor, which has doors on the left side to the bathroom and to a little pantry. When you walk through the corridor, you reach a sort of dining room. Between the corridor and the dining room, there’s an old wooden door. It’s painted white, and it has a thick panel of opaque glass in it (am I making sense? English is my second language).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that evening, the moment I set foot in the dining room, I heard three knocks on that glass panel, in rapid succession. It sounded exactly like someone tapping the glass with their fingernail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m aware that there’s probably a rational explanation for this. It’s an old wooden door, it creaks and such, or maybe me planting my foot in the dining room sent vibrations through the floor which caused the old door to make that sound. But please, bear in mind that over the course of 20 years, I walked through that door almost every. Single. Day. Thousands of times, and it never ONCE made a sound anything close to this, and it hasn’t since. Nor did I ever hear it make that sound when someone else walked through, which, again, I witnessed thousands of times. So, the door made a sound that somehow sounded exactly like a fingernail tapping the glass panel rapidly three times, which had never happened before and has never happened since, on the eve of my departing for a holiday abroad? You be the judge of how likely that sounds, but those are some coincidences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the incident, I was a little spooked, but not scared. It was immediately evident to me that it was just my grandma wishing me a good journey and asking me to be careful. Note that I’m usually a skeptic, albeit interested in the paranormal, and I do not believe in life after death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Un)fortunately, that’s the only experience I ever had. However, my aunt has more stories. Now, my aunt is not one to make up stories. She’s not the creative type, but she’s a very direct, no-bullshit kind of person, very independent and tough as nails. I have never ever seen her shed a tear, not even when grandma died. She’s just not a very outwardly emotional person. I love her very much and I have no reason to disbelieve her. She told me that she would often catch a whiff of my grandma’s perfume coming from what used to be her bedroom. She said the scent was particularly strong in the evening, when my grandma used to sit in the living room and watch TV. One night, my aunt was in her bedroom, when she heard knocking on the wall from my grandma’s room (their rooms are adjacent to one another), just like grandma used to do towards the end when she had already become bed-ridden and needed something from my aunt. The most incredibly experience (told to me by my aunt completely casually, as if it isn’t the coolest and creepiest thing ever) was one night when my aunt was again sitting in her room, when she started hearing knocking sounds coming from the direction of the bathroom. The sound moved from the bathroom to the pantry, then to the dining room, and finally to the kitchen which is right next to my aunt‘s room. So there’s this knocking that sounds like it’s coming from inside the cupboards, some banging from the pans in there or whatever, and it’s moving ever closer to her, so what does my aunt do? She yells „Goddamnit mom, I know you’re here! Stop being creepy!“ — silence. The sound is gone and does not start up again. This part always makes me laugh because who yells at their dead mom‘s ghost? My aunt, that’s who.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, my aunt has had a few more minor experiences, mostly the scent of perfume. It stopped when she got rid of the TV in the living room. Then, in December of 2018, an aneurysm burst in my aunt’s head. She came very, very close to dying. If my dad had not miraculously found her after just a few minutes, she would have died on the spot. She was in a coma for weeks, developed pneumonia, the works. She’s also in her 50’s, a heavy smoker and just not in great shape. So basically, the doctors told us it’s not looking very good. But my aunt pulled through and gradually got better and better. Today, she’s completely recovered and 100 % back to her own self. A few weeks after she woke up from her coma, she told us that when she was still in the coma, she had talked to my grandma who had told her it’s not her time to go yet. My aunt now is completely, steadfastly convinced that my grandma is her guardian angel who made my dad find my aunt on the floor and administer first aid and save her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s it. Make of that what you will! I know I don’t understand it. It’s difficult to reconcile when your own personal experience and that of loved one‘s you have no reason not to believe clashes with what you perceive as reality. For me, that means that while I do not believe in any kind of god, nor in the afterlife, and I’m unconvinced about ghosts and paranormal stuff like that, I myself have experienced something I cannot easily explain, as had my aunt who I believe fully and would trust with my life. And the funny thing is, most people you talk to have some kind of ghost story, don’t they? Each of my parents does, my buddy in the office does, and I know of so many others. Let’s not even go into the stories my in-laws from Vietnam have. Ghosts and such are a completely normal part of life there, especially for the older generation. Talk to any older Vietnamese person, and I guarantee they have at least one incredible story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where does that leave us? I don’t know. I don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"So, this is going to be one part journey one part creepypasta, but bare with me.

So, my moms side of the family has always been sensitive. Seeing spirits, feeling things, etc. When I was younger I could see spirits and sense when they were near. I could also feel weight displacements and the like and sense intent from said beings. To say, not all are good or evil. Some just doing their thing. 


Growing up I had trouble sleeping and naturally became a night owl. I could only sleep on my sides or i'd get sleep paralisis. It was in my teens that I supposedly would visit other planes. A forest home, a golden city on a hillside, the dark church, various places. I would also have experiences with malevolent spirits who would spiritually oppress me.

It would happen, and I would struggle and struggle, until I managed to break free. Kicker being, I didn't just break the oppression, I've broken out of my own body. The first time being in Japan. I went to sleep and woke up out of my body. Would keep walking away from it and repeatedly got pulled back by a tether or chain. It got to the point where if I was oppressed, I could at times break out of my body all together. So this story is one such example. 

I woke up and felt this immensly oppressive force, sensing something not so good nearby. I faught and steuggled and broke free. Regaining consciousness near our bathroom (outside my room) and has this almost instinctual calling. Something is in the house that shouldnt be, find it. This was not the first time, and I had learned prior to catch my sliritual breath. Because its very similar to being physically pinned, its exhausting.

Moving forward, I went into my roomies room. I looked around and saw this 7 foot tall grey humanoid. It was just staring at him as my friend layed flat in his bed. But when it took its eyes off him and looked at me, my friend shot up in his bed, 90 degree sitting. The thing then transformed and tried to shoot past me, but I intercepted it and wrestled. I woke up in my body then, and the next day asked the roomie about it, being intentionally vague. He had told me he woke up abruptly at that time said morning from an unpleasant dream or something.

Ive had many such experiences, in and out of body. Always that same instinct, get whatever it is out. Find it. So here are a few tips should you find yourself in a pinch, from experience.

1. Do not be afraid, such things feed on that. It weakens you and empowers them. 
2. Rage and confidence are both very potent. I had once been lifted out of my bed (spiritual form) by the neck by some tall cloaked black thing. Its face hidden in shadows. I got mad, really mad, pissed. How dare it do this to me! I was trying to sleep and am sick of this! I reached out with my own arm and grabbed its neck. And with that rage, snapped it. Regained consciousness after. Though rage isnt as reliable as Ive noticed rage and fear are closely linked, and can swap easily. Confidence, or the belief that you are strong is best.

I look at it like a shield, a wall that defends you. It is as strong or as weak as you allow. And with said confidence Ive been able to go toe to toe with some things. Course, I'm still very inexperienced as its not a state I try to get into, I'd rather just be asleep.

3. If paralized, wiggle ur toes. Trust me, its odd but works. Itll help you slowly regain control of your body. That, or be a stubborn fuck like I am some days and thrash about. 

4. Some stones and items do amplify your defences. Malachite, for example is a staple of mine. I've used obsidian too, but have noticed the defensive bubble is smaller. Its hard to explain, but I can tell how close or far things are. 


Don't get me wrong, all of your houses and such likely have some resident spirits or beings, but not nearly as many as you'd think want to hurt you. Many just observe, or just chill. And I have had experiences with protective spirits as well.

Honestly curious how to develop things, but ive no interest without bolstering my own defences.

TlDR: Against bad spirits, wiggle ur toes when oppressed, and fight back with a fortified mind or anger. Anger if the former isn't availible. I'd say its why poltergeists are so strong.

I get this tingling sensation in the back of my neck when someone is getting near me, way to close to be passing by. And it also works. None of my friends have been able to scare me, in fact, I scare them because I turn around the second before they jump on me. Does this happen to anyone too here? Or perhaps something different, but that you also believe it is something of a sixth sense?&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"This is my experience that made me completely believe in ghosts. It happened several years ago at my friend’s 14th birthday party/sleepover. In the group, there was me, Emily (the one throwing the party), Dae, Hayley, August, and Anne. (Fake names for anonymity).

Basically, while the rest of the group was doing something else, Dae and I were hanging out away from them and started looking at a list of ritual games for shits and giggles. Dae believed in ghosts and I was on the fence, but we didn’t really believe in the validity of anything we were looking at because the website was called something along the lines of “creepy for kids.”

We found a game called Catscratch, and to be blunt, it sounded so stupid and easy that we couldn’t resist. On the website, there were two different poems that both had something to do with cats. I think one of them was about an old lady with a mean cat, and the other one was about some giant cat with red eyes stalking you through an alleyway. Anyways, Person 1 lays down and puts their head in Person 2’s lap. 2 rubs 1’s temples and recites one of the poems. At the end, 1 sits up, 2 pulls up their shirt, and there’s supposed to be scratches on 1’s back.

We told the rest of the group about it, and we ended up trying it out sometime around 1 AM. My recollection of everything from this point is kind of hazy because it was so long ago, but I know that Dae and I went first. I was the one getting scratched, Dae read the story about the cat in the alleyway. I didn’t feel anything while they read the story to me, I just kept giggling because I thought the imagery with the giant evil cat was so stupid.

I don’t think anyone believed that anything would happen, but when I sat up and Dae pulled up my shirt, we were all really shocked to see that I actually had scratches. It didn’t burn or hurt at all, it just felt like a slight cool breeze across my back. I wasn’t scared, just hyped because I’ve always thought that the paranormal was super interesting. I don’t think anyone was able to get a photo in time because they faded quickly, but they all said that there were three small scratches that weren’t really deep, but were definitely noticeable.

Anyways, we kept playing for awhile after that. I don’t remember the exact order that everyone went in, but here’s everything that I can recall:

August had absolutely nothing to do with any of this, she watched from the corner while playing games on her phone.

I know for a fact that Emily was never the one that was being scratched, but she read the story/rubbed someone’s temples at least once.

I think that Dae read the story for someone else one other time, but was definitely the one being scratched at least once.

Emily read the story for Anne and I think she didn’t get any scratches at all. That, or they were really small and insignificant. I’d also like to add that Anne came from a more spiritual family and she had a protection ring. 

Either way, everything was mostly tame until we got to Hayley. She was the one being scratched, and I think Dae read the story. When Hayley sat up, the scratches across her back were huge. She initially only had three, but those three were getting longer and deeper, and eventually more started to appear. They would all fade quickly but more just kept appearing. At one point, she was getting six at once and they were all lightly bleeding. We all stopped playing after this, and Anne insisted on giving Hayley her protection ring despite Hayley being wary about it. 

I don’t completely trust my memory with this detail, but I think at some point, Hayley also started to get scratches across her chest and her stomach. Even if that didn’t happen, though, the scratches across her back eventually got so bad that she ended up taking off her shirt so she wouldn’t bleed on it.

Up until Hayley, we were all in the living room, but we all went into Emily’s bedroom once her scratches started to get a lot worse. At the time, Emily was a Christian, and she had a giant cross on her bedroom wall that she believed would protect all of us. She was the only one out of the group that was a Christian. If I remember correctly, nothing happened to Emily while she was in the bedroom, but Hayley was still getting scratches.

Dae and I were the ones that eventually left the bedroom to go get some salt. Nothing happened to us physically, but as soon as we stepped out of the room, there was definitely an oppressive feeling in the air. Dae asked me something along the lines of, “Did you just get hit with the saddest feeling right now?” I think it actually made me feel more anxious and panicked than sad, but either way, we got the salt and we poured some on Emily’s doorway, windowsills, room corners, and we all put some in our pockets.

After that, Hayley stopped getting scratches and we were all trying to figure out what to do because we didn’t know if there was still something outside of the room. At some point, Anne faked getting possessed and started mumbling gibberish (I think she admitted to Emily that she faked it years later, but even if she didn’t, none of us were really believing it because it was obviously fake). August started having a panic attack but we calmed her down.

Eventually, Emily got hungry and wanted someone to go into the kitchen with her, and I volunteered. She was grabbing some slices of pizza when she suddenly froze and started saying, “Lift up my shirt, lift up my shirt, something feels weird.”

I did, and I don’t even know how to describe what I saw. A little below the middle of her back, there was a smooth, wavy line, but it didn’t look red or irritated at all. It definitely wasn’t a scratch. It looked like those body mods where people get implants of things like stars under their skin, and the longer I looked at it, the more it popped out.

I hurried Emily back to her room, but it was gone by the time we got in there (it wasn’t any more than ten seconds between leaving the kitchen and getting back to her room). Anne ended up calling her mom and asking her what we should do. She told us to do a banishment ritual, and we ended up making a salt circle around Emily and Hayley (and me, because I wasn’t fucking around even though nothing really happened to me), chanting something, and probably some other steps that I don’t remember. Either way, it seemed to work. By the time we were done with that, it was around 3-4 AM.

Anyways, some other details I feel like could be relevant while looking back on everything:

1. Emily told us later that she was pretty sure her house was haunted before we did this. She had just moved there, too. I don’t know if anything paranormal continued in her house after that night. 
2. This happened during our summer break in between the 8th grade and our first year of high school. I mainly blame it on the nature of our town and how chaotic this period of teenagers’ lives tend to be, but Emily ended up going down a really rough path. We don’t really talk anymore. One of my friends that wasn’t involved in any of this told me that, the last time she heard from Emily, she smoked meth and then stole $100 worth of makeup from another friend, so there’s that.
3. Emily was never the one being scratched, she just read the story, but she still ended up getting that weird line.
4. Hayley is a HORRIBLE person. She was my friend at the time, but she’s extremely manipulative, abusive, and one of the biggest liars I’ve ever met. She’s out of all of our lives now, thankfully.
5. Despite Dae and I both being scratched in the ritual, nothing directly/physically happened to us afterwards, not counting the weird oppressive feeling that we both felt.
6. August, Dae, and I are all still very close, but we were never friends with Anne, Emily dropped off of the face of the earth, and we cut Hayley out of our lives. The three of us still talk about it and we never really figured out what happened that night.

That was all pretty long, so thank you for reading this far. I hope it was easy enough to follow, sorry if it’s a little scattered. If you have any theories about what was going on, I’d love to hear them.

Edit: Changed the initials into fake names for easier reading

Edit 2: Looking back on it, I’m honestly wondering if we summoned multiple entities? This would make sense to me considering the fact that we played it multiple times, and Emily’s house may have already been haunted. I think something there was definitely malevolent, judging by the oppressive feeling + the mark Emily got + Hayley’s scratches, but the situation with Hayley confuses me due to her nature as a person. Now that we cut her out of our lives due to her toxicity, I honestly wonder if the scratches she was getting were meant to be some sort of warning about her. That, or maybe her specific negative energy attracted something darker, which could explain why everyone else went without getting the really bad scratches. That still doesn’t explain what happened with Emily’s mark though, so I wonder what that was? Emily was never the one being scratched to begin with, so that leads me to believe her mark was unrelated to the game. So, maybe there was some sort of malevolent entity + the entity haunting her house + the entity we originally summoned with the game (assuming the malevolent spirit wasn’t the one originally summoned). Or maybe the game spirit was angered by Hayley’s presence/energy? I also think that Emily’s mark was made by something more sinister than a regular spirit because of how strange it was, I’ve never seen anything like it. It looked like something trying to push out of her skin. I really don’t know, I’m rambling lmao.

,Thetruthishere,"Was feeling mad anxious last night - a “somethings going to happen” feeling. I couldn’t shake it no matter what I tried - eating, praying etc. Just felt weird and nervous. I went to sleep and had weird dreams (I have dreams that I’ll see play out in real life sometimes, and others that just feel “important”) But i can’t remember those. 

Woke up around 6:30 then fell back to sleep and finally dreamed I had four daughters. (I only have one in rl) I lost the middle one and spent the dream trying to figure out what she looked like so I could find her. 

When I woke up I felt like today was really important, like felt like I had an assignment or something due that I was trying to remember. My husband was on his phone as I was waking up and trying to figure out this feeling when he told me Kobe and his daughter (one of four) died. 
Either because it was just really disheartening to hear and caused a stronger shift in my mood, or because I was feeling the mood from everywhere else abt his death - that anxious/impending feeling felt resolved. Same sensation as remembering something I had forgotten. 

I’m not implying I’m connected to Kobe in any kind of spiritual way - but I feel that I could have been picking up what other people were exuding. His death is pretty touching to almost everyone, he’s a household name so I believe that grief and surprise energy is huge right now. Does anyone think I could have been sensing the mood of people around me? 

I don’t like to give this too much presence, but I know things ahead of time pretty often. I sense stuff. I dream things, think things then hear it said by someone or hear it on tv. I have reoccurring numbers that change with my moods and unforeseen events. I’ve thought of someone before with the intention of getting them to write to me, and they did. I also think I have some ability to channel people, but again I don’t explore it or put too much presence on that.

Either because it was just really disheartening to hear and caused a stronger shift in my mood, or because I was feeling the mood from everywhere else abt his death - that anxious/impending feeling felt resolved. Same sensation as remembering something I had forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not implying I’m connected to Kobe in any kind of spiritual way - but I feel that I could have been picking up what other people were exuding. His death is pretty touching to almost everyone, he’s a household name so I believe that grief and surprise energy is huge right now. Does anyone think I could have been sensing the mood of people around me? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like to give this too much presence, but I know things ahead of time pretty often. I sense stuff. I dream things, think things then hear it said by someone or hear it on tv. I have reoccurring numbers that change with my moods and unforeseen events. I’ve thought of someone before with the intention of getting them to write to me, and they did. I also think I have some ability to channel people, but again I don’t explore it or put too much presence on that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I just being presumptuous with this created self-importance or does this resonate with anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Everyone here is so helpful and seems to have a large knowledge base when it comes to these things so I was hoping to get some insight into some events that happened when my brother and I were younger. I used to keep a journal when I was younger and just found it after my wife and I moved. Inside, I had written about the events and it made me start thinking about them again so I decided to talk to my parents and brother to clarify some things and post this for some insight. This may be a long post, so I'm very thankful in advance for anyone who reads and replies!

This all took place when I was around 9 and my brother was 2ish. We moved to a small town in Tennessee into my mother's childhood home to take care of my grandmother who was sick with cancer. 

Life was as normal as it could be given the situation for a while, but then strange things started to happen. Things would be misplaced or out of place. Lights turned on or off when we got back home. Small stuff. Around this same time, my brother started to talk to an imaginary friend. No body thought anything of it because, hey, he's a little kid. My brother only referred to him as ""the black man"" because he wouldn't tell him his name (after my brother got older, he clarified that it wasn't an african american man, but black as in dark, like a shadow). He would only talk to him in my parents' bedroom because, according to my brother, that's where he lived. More specifically, he lived behind my parents' dresser which was cater-cornered on the left side of their room by a closet. He told us that he had met the black man because he smelled something really bad, like a ""poot"" in his words, and heard crying. He thought it was mom, so he went into their room and saw him crying behind the dresser.

My brother and the black man continued conversing in my parents' room nearly every day. It all seemed like innocent kid stuff, like ""how old are you, I'm almost 3"" and ""what's your favorite food? That's gross, I like chips"" simple stuff like that. But then one night it seemed to turn more ominous. My brother finished eating and ran into my parents' room as usual to play. Everything was normal at first, but then we heard my brother sounding more anxious and heard him say ""No, you can't do that, that's mean"". A pause, and then ""but I love them"" and he started crying and ran out of the room.  My dad asked him about it but all he said was that they weren't friends anymore because the black man was bad. Months went by. My grandmother ultimately passed away from cancer, my dad ended up being laid off from his job, so an overall down time for our family. 

Then one night, dad and my brother were playing on the bed in my parent's room when my brother suddenly stopped, looked at the dresser and started crying. Dad held him, asking what was wrong, and Dad said he saw my brother tracking something moving around the bed and out the door toward the kitchen. My brother just responded that he didn't wanted to play in there anymore. Dad said it was like he wanted to keep an eye on whatever had left the room.

This continued for several more days. He would be playing, eating, anything, even be in mid sentence speaking, and would freeze up and look at something unseen to us and track it with his eyes. He would always want us to follow him into whatever room he had tracked the thing into. Around this time, my brother started having nightmares but wouldn't ever tell us what they were, but he became obsessed with making sure anything sharp was put up. If my parents had a knife out, he would watch them use it and clean it until he was sure it was safely back in the drawer. If one was left on the counter, whether my parents were done with it or not, he would take it to the sink. Finally, my parents asked him what was going on. My brother said that he wanted to know what the black man was doing because the black man had told him after their fight that he wouldn't leave any of us alone until he got what he wanted. My parents asked what that was and my brother just started crying. 

The next night things came to a head. My brother and I shared a bedroom and we were watching his favorite movie (land before time gang!) for the 1000th time and we fell asleep. I was woken up in the middle of the night to my brother shaking me. I could see his face in the dim light glow. It was pure terror. He had tears running down his face and his lips were trembling. I sat up and started asking him what was wrong and if he was ok over and over. I saw his eyes track from the bedroom door to behind me. My skin started to crawl and smelled a stench like rotten eggs and thought my brother had soiled himself. Then he said ""Be quiet"" a few seconds passed as my heart started to pound and I could feel my throat wanting to close up. Then he screamed ""Nooo!!! He found you! Don't you feel it?! He's tasting you!!"" I thought my heart was going to explode from fear. Then I heard a loud crash from parents' room and frantic shouting from my dad, screaming to my mother to wake up and help him get the kids. The smell instantly went away, our closet door banged shut and the night light went out, plunging us into darkness. We both screamed at the top of our lungs. My parents ran in, picked us up and we left the house to stay in a hotel for the night.

We went to a small Christian school, so the next morning my parents called one of the pastors on the board and they ended up having a meeting. They explained the whole story to them and the board ended up sending several pastors over to our house and they and my parents prayed over it, sort of like blessing it I guess? I'm not sure, it was a weird experience. But whatever it was, it seemed to have worked. Years went by without another mention of the black man. However, he finally made one last appearance. When my brother was 5, we were playing games on the couch when he suddenly stopped playing, stood up on the couch to look out the window into our back yard and said, ""He's back."" I asked if he meant the black man, and he said ""Yes...he's looking at us thru the window. He's so mad. He can't come inside. He can't get what he wants and he's mad."" I think what terrifies me the most about that is that the window was at least 15 ft off the ground, meaning that whatever this thing is was either that tall to be able to look thru the window, or was perched on the side of the house, 15 ft up, looking inside.

&amp;#x200B;

After that day, my brother never mentioned him again. He either stopped seeing the black man or never told us if he did. When my brother was in high school I finally decided to ask him about what he saw. He told me the black man was like a large shadow, but you couldn't see thru him. He had dark red eyes with deep black pupils and a jagged, deformed looking mouth with a long tongue. The rest of his face was featureless and just blackness. And he always knew the black man was around because he could smell him. Sometimes he would wake up from the smell and see him standing at the end of our bed. And when the black man was mad, he shimmer. My brother described it like looking across a black top pavement on a hot day. He said that they started talking about innocent stuff like favorite foods and toys and stuff. But then the black man started asking if he had ever hurt things, like birds or pets and tried to convince him to because it would be fun and they could be best friends if he did. Then he told him to hurt his family, told him to poke us with a knife while we were asleep and then to poke his own neck with the knife and they could play together forever. That was the night my brother became so upset and started having nightmares and is why he was so paranoid about sharp things.

The night of the major event still gives me nightmares. My brother said he had woken up from another nightmare to see the black man standing in our bedroom doorway. He told my brother that my parents had forgotten to put one of the knifes up after dinner, that it was time to go play. My brother woke me up at that point and the black man walked behind me and extended his tongue. My brother claims it was at least 3 ft long, skinny, with a small fork at the end. He says that it went around my neck and up to my ear. When my Dad woke up in the panic, the black man apparently screamed in anger and fled thru the closet. Speaking with Dad about that night, he said that he had an extremely vivid dream. It was so bright he could barely see anything but could see the silhouette of a very tall, broad shouldered person who spoke to him. In a booming voice he said, ""Awaken and flee, for the great serpent, that dragon, has brought his rotten seed down upon you and your house!""

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is a lot to take in. And a lot to believe for other people who aren't as open about these things which is why I hardly ever talk to anyone about it. If it were just my brother, I would have chalked it up to a child's imagination coupled with the stress of moving and the loss of a grandparent. But with so many shared experiences between us all, it's hard to accept that as an explanation. And my father is a no nonsense, straight edge type of man. He's honest, and I don't see a reason in him making up his end of it. Maybe some families are just more susceptible or whatever to these kinds of things? We moved from Adams, TN which, if anyone doesn't know, is famous for the Bell Witch and I can remember weird things happening even there, but those are different stories for another time.

,Thetruthishere,"So a little background. I’m in the Military. Air Force specifically. I live on a base in the the dormitory. The base is located in the USA.

One particular night on a Saturday night a little over a year ago at about 1:40ish in the morning I was relaxing in my dorm when suddenly, I get hungry. On weekdays I worked from midnight-8am so I did what I normally did when I get hungry in the middle of the night on a weekend. I hopped in my car and drove the nearest fast food place open 24 hours. I grab my food and I head back to base.

There I was across the street from the base. The only thing between me and the gate was a red traffic light. Across the street I can see a figure make an exchange with the security forces guys and then the figure proceeds onto base. The light turns green which prompts me to advance towards the gate. I roll down the window, show the guy my ID, and I drive through. The same figure I saw walk onto base is walking in the side walk now.

Now the thing about this base is it’s really freaking big. I mean, the guy was on foot. Chances are it could take 30 minutes upward to an hour to get to where he was going.

I stopped my car beside him and asked him if he needed a ride. He gladly accepted after stating he lived in a dormitory and entered the backseat of my car. He conveniently lived in the same dormitory I did. We had a mini conversation, but it was a pretty normal. He talked about all the places he’s been to and he kept urging me to try to go to Korea for some reason. I talked a little about my job, but I never stated how long I lived on base or anything time based really. 

Anyway, we reach the dormitory together. He gets out of the car and before closing the door he says, “You only have,” and he stated the exact amount of time I had until my enlistment was over. Then the door closes. I take a moment (I’m talking mere seconds here) to do the math in my head it’s not like I’m counting down the days until my enlistment is over. He was right! I jump out of my car. To my surprise he’s already gone. “Did he sprint to the dorms?” I think to myself. I bolt to the dorms myself only to be greeted by empty corridors. There was no sign of him.

Who was that guy? Why did he urge me to go to Korea so bad? Most importantly, where did he vanish to?

I still think about from time to time this to this day. I never saw the guy again. Coincidentally, I recently met a girl from Korea. She unfortunately had to go back to Korea so I’m planning on taking a trip to see her. Not sure if that’s related, but it’s a thing.

What do you guys think? Who or what was that guy? Am I just crazy or is this some weird paranormal stuff?",t2_1qz606ed,False,,0,False,Did I give a paranormal being a ride home?,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,2,0,False,t3_eu5ytv,False,dark,,public,44,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Ghosts/Apparitions,False,44,,False,,1580434340.0,,[],{},,True,,1580069539.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a little background. I’m in the Military. Air Force specifically. I live on a base in the the dormitory. The base is located in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular night on a Saturday night a little over a year ago at about 1:40ish in the morning I was relaxing in my dorm when suddenly, I get hungry. On weekdays I worked from midnight-8am so I did what I normally did when I get hungry in the middle of the night on a weekend. I hopped in my car and drove the nearest fast food place open 24 hours. I grab my food and I head back to base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I was across the street from the base. The only thing between me and the gate was a red traffic light. Across the street I can see a figure make an exchange with the security forces guys and then the figure proceeds onto base. The light turns green which prompts me to advance towards the gate. I roll down the window, show the guy my ID, and I drive through. The same figure I saw walk onto base is walking in the side walk now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the thing about this base is it’s really freaking big. I mean, the guy was on foot. Chances are it could take 30 minutes upward to an hour to get to where he was going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped my car beside him and asked him if he needed a ride. He gladly accepted after stating he lived in a dormitory and entered the backseat of my car. He conveniently lived in the same dormitory I did. We had a mini conversation, but it was a pretty normal. He talked about all the places he’s been to and he kept urging me to try to go to Korea for some reason. I talked a little about my job, but I never stated how long I lived on base or anything time based really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we reach the dormitory together. He gets out of the car and before closing the door he says, “You only have,” and he stated the exact amount of time I had until my enlistment was over. Then the door closes. I take a moment (I’m talking mere seconds here) to do the math in my head it’s not like I’m counting down the days until my enlistment is over. He was right! I jump out of my car.

The thing looks like it is close in the video but it was a few hundred yards off shore and it was huge, I would say atleast 60 feet long you could visually see it rolling in the water. During this video there was a small group of people videoing off shore as well. Toward the end it goes into a small bay so me and my dad hopped in the truck and drove toward the area it was headed but when we got to the bay it was nowhere to be seen.

,Thetruthishere,"So I had ayahuasca, an indigenous medicinal and hallucinogenic brewing from the Amazon Forest, with a couple of friends here in Brazil and we usually stay lying down for most of the ceremonies. Some people stand up and dance, take walks but not this guy here.

The first time I went to one of those ceremonies, I felt nothing. The second time I was less nervous and the restlessness didn't catch up to my thinking so I was more relaxed.


Ah, the thing with this ceremony is we take 2 shots. One after you've acclimated to the place and once again when you're more comfortable, as we call, ""in the power"".


I felt nothing from the first shot so I asked the shaman if he could apply some rapé (medicinal powder from tree skins and roots to shoot up your nose so it hits you instantly) so I could focus on my own journey more still and more stable. She (they were a shaman couple) gave me some, I went back to my sleeping bag, and also had indigenous medicinal eye drops, called Sananga, and they feel like two burning and steaming hot metal rods deepening your eyeball. Seriously. The pain is SO intense that it's a known ""bad-trip"" killer in the indigenous communities.


Then my second shot.


That's when I see circles and triangles and then I saw some CRAZY shit. I couldn't remember what it was until next morning, 10am. The visions wore off, I came home, laid my head down on the pillow and... man... I just remembered it all.


What I had seen was a slave from probably 1800s (Brazil was the top slave trading country in the world, a lot of people's family tree is mixed with the African people) with his neck twisted and his face bloody. I think his chest was also slashed open but I couldn't bear to check.



Then I forgot about it again. That happens a lot with this medicine.


At night, at my gf's, I was getting ready to sleep when I remembered it again and told my gf about it, we started to theorize about it and, during my theorizing, with our closed in order to fall asleep while theorizing, I say ""maybe I killed this guy... [long pause] maybe this guy was my grandpa's dad or something...[long pause] maybe... maybe I was this guy...


Then all the flashes started again. The circles, the triangles, Sacred Geometry they call them. I remember his face very vividly while the circles didn't have a pattern...


I know there's no werewolf or vampires but this indigenous unknown made me feel deeply affected spiritually.


EDIT: wow thanks for the responses guys. Every single info is good for debate unless you're a self centered biatch like in some comments.


So after some redditors enlightened me on the topic, I found out that Sananga actually resets the energy field on the body, **if not making the trip even more intense**. Very bright redditors, thanks for the teachings. Stay tuned, February 22nd I'll go again and tell you guys what I saw.

,Thetruthishere,"Apart from major ups and downs, my life is pretty bland when it comes to the paranormal. I’ve always been attracted to ghost stories and creature sightings, even from a small age, so it’s no wonder that when it comes to things of a more ghostly nature, I feel a void. I always wondered why so many people would experience supernatural events, and yet I had nothing. Nothing ever happened to me that couldn’t be explained with “the house is old and broken.” That was until a night I spent sleeping alone in a granny flat at age 12.

For context, my parents hit the rocks and we ended up having to live in a caravan park. We were a large family of many children, so the park owners took pity on us and moved us to bigger and bigger caravans as they opened up until one of the granny flats became available, which as I’m writing this I realised may have been because someone died. The granny flats at the end of the park were usually reserved for the elderly who wanted a cheap place to spend their golden years, or less fortunately, for the childless, terminally ill seniors who need cheaper accommodation to pay for their medical expenses.

One of these terminally ill seniors was “Bob.” (Name changed not for privacy, but because I forgot. Sorry, Bob. Rest your weary soul.) Bob lived in the granny flat just in front of us, and my mother would frequently chat with him, which is how we learned of his cancer and upcoming chemotherapy treatments.

Anyways, I never felt creeped out by any of the caravans we’d been in so far, and nothing scary ever happened in them. The same went for the granny flat. In fact, I was charmed by the “little house” aesthetic that was going on. My siblings and I had fun exploring the two bedrooms, kitchen, living room, and very skinny bathroom. The bedroom which I greedily claimed as my own was the one with the bathroom attached. This is where the incident happened.

With so many kids, I rarely ended up sleeping on my own, even when my dad set up the bunk bed in the other room. There were just too many of us, no matter how much I insisted that it was MY room. However, there was one night when I finally did whine enough to get what I wanted, and my siblings all slept in the other room while my parents slept on the couch (I’m so sorry, I was such a huge brat when I was 12. Don’t hold it against me, though, it was due to childhood trauma. But yes, I also want to slap 12 year old me.) I stayed up late playing video games and finally decided I’d try to sleep at around 1AM.

I lay there with my eyes closed for what felt like 30 minutes, but was most likely 10. I wasn’t tired in the slightest, but knew if I opened my eyes I’d have to start all over again to get to sleep. Out of nowhere, a feeling of dread came over me, and I kept my eyes closed for good reason now. 

Y’all know the fight or flight response? Yeah, when I’m feeling dread, I choose freeze. 

This wasn’t the first time it happened. Frequently when I tried to sleep as a child a feeling of dread would suddenly loom over me, and I’d shut my eyes tightly for fear that if it knew I was awake, it would hurt me. I always feel a presence watching me when this happens, and it ain’t a good one. I always believed that if I continued to act as if everything was fine, even when I was awake, it would get bored and leave. I’d feel the dread, and then I’d “freeze”. I would continue to do what I was doing, be it sleeping, drawing, reading, but I wouldn’t change actions. I wouldn’t move in the bed, I wouldn’t lift my pencil, I wouldn’t flip the page. I would remain like a broken record until it went away.

I kept my eyes shut and tried to keep my breathing steady. Then my hair moved. It sort of but didn’t quite feel like fingers. It felt more like little bugs, like ants in my hair. It was like big ants or tarantula legs caressing my head. Or as if a person was touching my hair with their finger tips applying the lightest pressure. It was definitely too rhythmic to be a bug, too. It was in the same fashion as when someone strokes a cat. 

I was freaking out, but I wouldn’t let myself move no matter how much my body screamed at me to run. The “presence” of my childhood was trying bigger tactics to scare me, and I was having none of it. In my mind, if I let it scare me by touching me, then it would do it more often and to a greater extent, so I needed to show it I was unaffected. I did something truly brave to my 12 year old self. 

I turned around. 

I overcame my freezing to turn around to face the wall while resisting the urge to take off running. Surely this would show the presence that I wasn’t scared, I thought. It stopped stroking my hair, and nothing happened for a minute. I took this as an opportunity to calmly walk to where my siblings were sleeping and safely sleep there while loudly complaining about how cold it is. I opened my eyes to leave but was met with the grinning face of an old man.

The face was just, well, a face. It didn’t have a body. It didn’t even have a head. It was just the face of an old man that somewhat resembled Bob, but then again, all bald old men look the same. The face didn’t have colour, and the outlines of its features were green, like, the same kind of green glow that glow in the dark stars have. It almost looked like someone sketched a face on the wall with a glow in the dark pen. The face was slightly hovering. It blinked at me, and then it dissipated into little green particles. 

I couldn’t hold it together anymore, and I bolted to my siblings’ room and sat there on the bed pale faced. My mad dash awoke my mother, who asked me what was wrong. I explained what I saw, and at the time she didn’t believe me and told me I must have been dreaming.  I didn’t feel like arguing, so I just lay down and fell asleep among the spread out bodies of my little siblings. Sure, their legs were uncomfortable, but it was a hell of a lot better than being alone. I wondered if maybe I was being punished for being a brat, and I basically gave the ghost face a big “fuck you” when I proudly chose to sleep in that room alone the next night just to show it who’s really the boss here. Nothing happened, so maybe it gave up on me. As you can probably tell, I was one of those kids who saw punishment for my actions as a challenge of dominance. Sorry, Dad. 

Anyway, I have a couple of theories as to what happened that night.

Most plausibly my mother was right. I was dreaming. Sleep paralysis seemed like an explanation. Especially when you consider that I couldn’t move for some time. However, my inability to move seemed to me more of a conscious choice, and I did end up rolling over halfway through, so this most likely isn’t an explanation. 

Another theory I have is that the apparition I saw was Bob. He was at the hospital at the time, and whether he was dead or alive was unknown to me at the time, and this was one of the first things I thought of when I reflected on the event that night considering the ghost face didn’t hurt me, smiled at me, and stroked my hair. However, I later found out that Bob was, in fact, alive that night. So maybe it was the culmination of his energy? I don’t know.

Since someone most likely died there in that flat, I thought that perhaps it could be their ghost. This seems like the most fitting theory, however it doesn’t explain the feeling of dread in the beginning. I only recently saw the “dread” as a seperate entity which followed me, but it could also just be a side effect of ghosts presenting themselves throughout my life, so maybe paranormal events aren’t so shy to me after all. 

In the end, showing my fear didn’t make the “dread” worse. Nothing touched me after that, at least I don’t think so. I think there may have been a time where the dread or something stroked my cheek, but it was so brief it could have been my hair or the wind. The dread hasn’t visited me in a long time, but I’m less scared of it now, and more annoyed that it stops me from sleeping comfortably, so I’m mentally prepared for when it next decides to visit. I’m still very confused as to what happened that night, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on the matter.",t2_5ev28p5t,False,,0,False,That Time A Disembodied Face Smiled At Me,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_etjvel,False,dark,,public,48,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,48,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579943385.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from major ups and downs, my life is pretty bland when it comes to the paranormal.

,Thetruthishere,"As the title says. 

Since I was a little kid, I've always had pretty vivid dreams. So vivid that sometimes I can feel physical pain and also having the ability to read full pages or books, but after waking up I always shaked them up and didn't pay too much attention to them. 

A few nights ago I had a dream about a huge earthquake. I was dreaming about mundane things, as some of us do, but I remember having this feeling of dread. Before I knew, an earthquake started to hit. I never felt an earthquake before as I do not live near a seismic centre, yet my subconscious knew what it was. Also, my subconscious told me to go under a door frame, as I did, I remember yelling at other people to do the same, or to take cover and protect themselves, yet nobody paid attention to me. I remember that I even left the door frame in order to grab some of them under the door frame, but I was dismissed or ignored. 

Today, I was cleaning the house and the TV was on the news where I found out about the 6.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Turkey where almost 20 people died and more than 600 injured. (My thoughts goes to the families and victims affected by this tragedy) After hearing the news I started feeling shortness of breath and my heart started pounding.

I guess I should pay more attention to my dreams?

As a side note: since the beginning of the year, I've had this weird feeling. It feels like the feeling of an impending doom, the one you have when you're at the beginning of a panic attack, yet the panic attack never starts.

I tried to run away and was caught and forced to undergo a form of torture where they locked me in a dark room, somewhere where many people were, and had everyone knock on the walls and laugh. It was very traumatizing and cruel. I eventually escaped and am safe but I just want you guys to be aware of the truth...&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"Hi! So, recently I’ve bee hearing voices over different noises. You might be asking if I’m schizophrenic, but it’s only happened on my property. Here are a few examples:

Like the true stories I’ve written, I want to have some context; My family lives on a 5acre property. There is a large slope, down to a small park, and there is a gate. Now to the story:

When I was younger, My dad would call my name with his big booming voice, cause our property was so big. So he would call me with it, and I’d yell back. This one day, I was outside playing when I hear his loud booming voice “BAXTERISCUTE!” “YEAAH?” No response. 
I decided to see if my dad was home, so I checked the driveway, no car. At that moment, I remembered my dad was out in a meeting, so it was impossible for him to call me.

My second experience was when I was asked by my dad to get the lawnmower. I was dragging the lawnmower, and pulling it towards the driveway. That’s when I hear a voice of an old woman yell “HEY!” I turned around, thinking someone was there. Nope. I continued dragging it, when I hear it again “HEY!” It spooked me so much I dropped the gasoline can in my hand. I turn around and again, no one was there. I dragged it the last few feet, when I hear the voice mumbling and disappeared. 

Now, I stated this in my gnome story, but, my forest is abundent with voices. I can hear giggling sometimes, hear my name called behind me, etc. But this final story happened a few days ago. 

I was walking home from work, after taking the bus, when I walked to the gate in the park that leads to my 5acre property. I click the code, door opens. I close the door, and I hear “Hello, Why are you here?” I immediately bolted up my hill, not looking back. I knew I checked around the area prior to opening the gate, and no one was there.

,Thetruthishere,"So I'd like to start by saying this is all 100% true, no exaggerations or alterations hatsoever. Also, I apologize if this doesn't flow well, I'm far from an experienced writer but I'll do my best. 

When I was in high school, my best friend (let's call him Tyler) lived a few houses down from me. We hung out at each others houses frequently, spent a lot of our free time together. Both of had experienced different things I can only label as super natural or other-worldly, so much to the point that we would often tell each other things that had happened to us growing up or recently. Things like seeing people that shouldn't be some where, items around the house moving with no logical expliantion, hearing things or voices when we're alone, etc. Typical things for people who are tuned in to those sorts of things. 

Well, Tyler's house for some reason seemed to be a hot spot for these occurrences, as well as our neighborhood in general. Where we were used to be a huge farm land close to a century ago, in fact there's still a barn left on one of the properties. At some point, there was a fire in the barn that killed a couple people. I didn't know about that until after I was said barn on fire and could hear screams coming from it. I went to get an adult (I would have been around 10, maybe 11) and when I turned back around the barn was back to normal, no sign of smoke, people, anything. A week after was when I learned there had been a fire there.

Anyways, I'm getting side tracked. At Tyler's house, doors would open and close themselves, showers would turn themselves on, lights turning on or off, random items dropping off of counters or shelves. Things like this happened so much that even his skeptic family acknowledged it happened but they never really said or thought anything about it. If they did, they never mentioned it. Tyler and I always felt as though whatever was causing everything lived in the basement, which sucked because after his older sister moved out for college, he moved into her room down there. 

One summer night, Tyler and I were in his back yard having a bon fire, just hanging out and talking. We started it about an hour before sunset. All was normal, we were talking and joking and laughing. We had to keep quiet because his dad had to wake up practically in the middle of the night for work and his window faced the back yard where we were. When the sun had just set on the horizon, we noticed someone in their kitchen window. We didn't give it a second thought, assuming it was his dad getting water from the sink. Neither of us said anything to the other but we knew each other had seen him. A few minutes later, we see 'his dad' in the French doors to the back deck staring at us. At this point, one of us said something about how it was weird he was awake. That's when we looked closer and noticed that we couldn't make out any features other than a basic outline of a male adult, around 6'3 or so. We then realized that it definitely was not his dad. As I mentioned earlier, things like this were not abnormal for either of us. We silently agreed to ignore it so it would leave us alone. We've seen what happens when you acknowledge them. A few minutes later, the figure is gone.

About 5 minutes later, we hear what sounds like footsteps walking behind us, and I don't know about him but all the hair on my body stood up straight. We both knew what it was since it couldn't possibly be a person. There was 1 gate to the back yard and we were facing at it, and we would have also seen/heard someone coming from the French doors on the deck. Again, we agreed not to acknowledge it. It would go away we thought. And that might have been true, but that's not what happened. 

I don't know if I would call myself a full empath, but I am very sensitive to people's emotions that I am near. Out of no where, I feel someone else's anger. Rage like I had never felt before, the only word I could use for it would be hatred. I looked at Tyler to see if it was coming from him or if he felt it too, and he did. When I looked at him, he told me ""Ignore it. Don't talk about it."" I tried to do just that, and did for about 30 seconds, when we both heard the footsteps moving from behind me to behind him, maybe 20 feet away. After that, we heard them walking from behind him back to behind me, this time 10 feet away if even that. This is when I started to feel sick to my stomach and nervous. I was afraid it would hurt us or taunt us some how. 

I did my best to ignore it, but then I looked back at the fire. In the corner of my eye, I saw the figure from the window again, but this time in the yard with us, about 15 feet away from me near the corner of the fence, just standing there, not moving one bit. I got Tyler to look too and he said he knew and that it was okay. He was trying to keep me calm, I guess hoping it would just leave. I shut my eyes and tried to slow my heart. That's when we heard a sigh, practically in the middle of us. At that, I jumped up from my seat and started yelling. I said go away, leave us alone, we don't want you hear. Tears were welling up in my eyes. Tyler stood from his chair and grabbed me. He guided me inside the house and we went down to his room in the basement. I told him that I was so scared because I knew that that.. thing, wanted to hurt him, and I knew that at the moment at least, it absolutely had the ability to. I didn't know how, but I have no doubt it would have been severe, if not permanent. 

Earlier that day, before we went to his house, my parents told me I couldn't stay at his house that night because we had church in the morning. I was never one to break a rule, talk back, or pick an argument with my parents. They always treated me with respect so I did the same to them, but with everything that happened upon how certain I was that this thing was going to hurt him, I called one of my dad and told him to get my mom on the line. I told them something close to this ""I'm sorry but I'm not coming home tonight. There is something here with us and it is angry, it hates Tyler and it is going to hurt him if I don't stay with him. I'll make sure I'm up and ready in time for church but I am not leaving him tonight."" 

My dad fought me on in for a minute, which I anticipated, but that's why I asked him to get my mom on the phone too. Whatever ability it was that Tyler and I have, my mom had it too but 10X stronger. She was tormented with visits as a kid and as an adult she's had dozens of spirits come to her for help. Point is, I knew she would understand. And she did, she helped me convince my dad it was okay for me to stay with Tyler. 

I know this whole story is a mess and I apologize, I might go back and edit it to make it flow as best as I can, I'm typing this all on my phone right now.

I hope at least some of you trust this is true. I actually started to tear up a bit just writing this, remembering hoe terrified I was. The only things that compare to how scared I was would be when my dad had a heart attack, my mom's stroke, or my brothers seizure (yes we all have some pretty bad health issues lol)

I told them something close to this &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry but I&amp;#39;m not coming home tonight. There is something here with us and it is angry, it hates Tyler and it is going to hurt him if I don&amp;#39;t stay with him. I&amp;#39;ll make sure I&amp;#39;m up and ready in time for church but I am not leaving him tonight.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad fought me on in for a minute, which I anticipated, but that&amp;#39;s why I asked him to get my mom on the phone too. Whatever ability it was that Tyler and I have, my mom had it too but 10X stronger. She was tormented with visits as a kid and as an adult she&amp;#39;s had dozens of spirits come to her for help. Point is, I knew she would understand. And she did, she helped me convince my dad it was okay for me to stay with Tyler. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this whole story is a mess and I apologize, I might go back and edit it to make it flow as best as I can, I&amp;#39;m typing this all on my phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope at least some of you trust this is true. I actually started to tear up a bit just writing this, remembering hoe terrified I was. The only things that compare to how scared I was would be when my dad had a heart attack, my mom&amp;#39;s stroke, or my brothers seizure (yes we all have some pretty bad health issues lol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone liked reading this, please let me know in the comments, or if you have any suggestions I&amp;#39;m open to improving. I have dozens of stories that I would love to share if anyone is interested. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

1988,  3am, alone except for my dog, and sound  asleep. I hear three very loud  knocks on my door which was right next to my bed. I woke up and bounded  to the door in three steps. My dog was already at the door in alert  mode and listening. I looked out the peep hole in the door expecting to  see a cop. Nothing there. Then I realized that my door is inside a gated  court yard with 6 ft  high brick walls and the gate was locked. No one  could have run off without being seen or heard climbing the gate.

2005,  4am, 22 year old son is home from college, and I am awakened by three  loud knocks. The sound seemed to come from all directions at once. I got  up and checked out the house.  Nothing. Later that morning my son gets  up and says ""did you hear the three knocks last night?"" I said ""yes, it  is the second time that I have heard knocks around 3am.""  I consulted a  respected psychic and she said that it was grandpa checking on you and  that he looks like you.""

My mother  died in 2011. In 2014 I dreamed that I saw her face against a  black  background and she says ""you are going to need a bigger patio"". I woke  up and said to myself wow that seemed real and went about my day  thinking about the experience. Two weeks later, my son calls me and asks  if he can store some weight lifting equipment at my house. I said OK  and he said he was on his way. He arrived with two friends in a large  flatbed truck loaded with equipment. They unloaded the equipment onto my  back patio completely covering it. I watched as they filled the last  remaining space on the patio and I remembered the dream and instantly  understood its meaning. My mom just let me know that she still exists.

Age  10, its summer and I am home alone around 6pm watching TV. A stack of  books on a shelf above by bed shot off the shelf and landed in the  middle of my bedroom.

1968. 2am. I  can't sleep and don't want to disturb my  wife. So I go sit on the  couch in the front room in the dark. The couch faces a fireplace with a  TV in front of it.  So I am looking in the direction of the TV. Behind  me is the doorway into the hallway which leads to a bathroom to the left  and our bedroom to the right. As I am sitting there in darkness I  notice movement of a reflection on the black TV screen. I focused on the  movement and it looks like the reflection of a  woman dressed in a  white gown moving left and right in the dark hallway door opening. Just  back and forth towards the bathroom and then towards the bedroom. I  watched this for about a half hour and would look in the hallway and see  nothing, but when I looked back at the TV there was the white  apparition floating back and forth. I got bored and went back to bed.

2014.   I am babysitting my 4 year old granddaughter. She has a DVD with old  Disney Christmas shows she wants to watch. One of the old shows from  1953 comes on and there is an old fashion band playing.  My  granddaughter says ""I used to watch this with all of my cousins."" This  went on for weeks and I didn't say anything. Her mom told me that my  granddaughter also said the same thing at her other grandparents house.  Finally,  the next time it came up I said to my granddaughter ""you only  have one cousin"" My granddaughter replied that she did have more  cousins. So I said ""where are they?"" She looked at me and pointed her  index finger up at the ceiling. I said ""why are they here?""  She replied  ""they protect me. They keep me safe""  I said ""why can't I see them"".  She replied ""they are hiding"".

Maternal  great grandmother told me this story about my mom during WW2 when my  dad was in the Army Air Corps. With the war on, my mom lived with and  shared a bedroom with her grandmother. One night my grandmother said  that my mom sat up in bed and said ""Oh my god his airplane just broke in  half and is going down"".  Some days after my moms vision,  my dad  called my mom and told her that was on a training flight in a Lockheed  Hudson bomber over Georgia. He was in the tail of the airplane when the  tail broke off. He was able to parachute safely, but he rest of the crew  in the front of airplane couldn't get out and died.

1956.  Both of my maternal grandparents died in October 1956 when I was about 8  years old. Months later I am at school.  The bell for recess rings and I  skip playing with my friends and instead walk out to the farthest  extent of the playground to an old baseball diamond. I am just hanging  out playing with the chain link fence around the dugout. The bell rings  to end recess and I ignore it.

My mom left my stepdad for a new guy and I went to live with my grandparents for the summer. My grandpa could see I was a bit depressed so he packed up the car and took me and my cousins on a trip to Disneyland. We had a great time and I made memories I’ll never forget. On the way back though, I saw something that has never quite sat right with me.

As I type this, the hairs on the back of my neck are standing up. We were somewhere between Anaheim, CA and Phoenix, AZ (but on the CA side of the border) late at night when, over the mountain range I noticed a huge bright blinding light.

,Thetruthishere,"To start in a typical fashion, I don't really believe in this stuff. I would like to, and I have had small, strange incidents throughout my life that can possibly be explained, but ultimately are a little beyond the norm. I grew up in rural Ireland, and I think in my teens the idea of the supernatural simply excited me. Being surrounded by old farmers with their strange folk tales, and even members of my family who held defiant stances against the paranormal world, but had inexplicably experienced strange things, I grew up with an eager attention towards these things, but definitely do not hold any strong beliefs. 

Either way, I have experienced some weird things that may interest some of you, and I intend to write a few of them up. Just because. 

This particular situation is just what happened, I'm implying nothing nor making any assumptions/ conclusions. Just writing it up as it happened. 

About 5 years back, I lived with my father in the UK over summer while awaiting my uni to start again in September. It was a relatively newish house in a nice residential area of a large town. The house was at the top of a hill and nearby was a small graveyard. I had my PC set up in our dining room, on the table placed so I had my back facing the large bay window. That night my father was away somewhere and it was just me and my step mother at home. At this point she was in bed and it was quite late, definitely after midnight. I got a text that he would be back in around an hour/ two hours time.

Despite knowing he was coming home later, while just browsing stuff I heard a tap on the window. I instantly assumed it was my father having returned super early. I turned round and couldn't see anyone but this didn't shake the idea that he must have been home and wanted me to open the door for him. Bare in mind this was the back of the house, so in the adjoining kitchen there was a back door, only about 5 foot away from the edge of the bay windows, so it made sense for him to be tapping on the window. 

I get up, go to the kitchen, open the door and find no-one there. I figured ""oh well, strange occurrence"" and shrugged it off. It was a nice night though, so I just stood in the doorway for a minute and looked at the stars. It was only a minute, but suddenly, exactly where I was looking, I saw a weird shape flash across the sky. It was like a shooting star but it very rapidly sped in the same shape a heartbeat monitor makes when it blips up and down, only from right to left instead. As in it travelled in a line from the right, shot up, then directly down, then back up halfway and off again in a straight line. I felt like I watched it move but it went so fast that I basically saw the whole shape in one instance. It was about as long as your finger would cover at arm's length. Again I just thought it was weird. Immediately after, I heard stuff move on the kitchen counter directly behind me. In fact, it made the exact noise of the kettle being placed on its base. So similarly that I just 100% believed my step mother had woken and was putting the kettle on. I spoke to greet her and turned around, only to find the room empty and still.

I thought it was weird, but I left things alone and went back to my PC. The night ended normally.

Now the next bit is hard to describe effectively, and in my opinion is both more explicable but understandably hard to believe. It may also be totally unrelated to the first half of this story. Over the next 2-3 weeks I was harassed by a tiny shape. I remember it starting almost immediately after that night, but in no way can remember specific time frames. We had a piano in that same dining room, and in the middle of the day I was sat playing it. While playing it, I started seeing this little shadow, about 5-6 inches tall, dart behind things. For instance, I would see it in my peripheral hide behind my leg. Or I would be looking at the piano and notice it move behind a picture frame on top. It did not stay exclusively in my peripheral, it would sometimes move around quite close to the center of my vision, but just in areas I wasn't directly focusing on. It wouldn't move across large stretches at first either, more just I would notice it quickly hide behind things as if it had been peeking out and I hadn't previously noticed it. 

I remember while playing the piano this first time, over this 10 minute window it happened over and over to the point where I became really frustrated and tense. It wasn't frightening at all but so frustrating that it began stressing me out. 

This happened as I said for about 3 weeks. In this time I also moved out of my father's house and into my new student house. I was happy to be back with my friends in a free environment, but was still kept on edge by this constant shadow. I didn't mention it to anyone for the duration it happened for. It escalated at one point to where I would be sitting in a room and see it fly around the ceiling and hide behind lightshades like a bat flitting about. In the few times I clearly remember seeing it, I was alone, although it may have happened a few times with other people in the room. 

And then just as it started, it suddenly stopped. And that was it. I was left alone. 

I accepted it and moved on.

I would like to, and I have had small, strange incidents throughout my life that can possibly be explained, but ultimately are a little beyond the norm. I grew up in rural Ireland, and I think in my teens the idea of the supernatural simply excited me. Being surrounded by old farmers with their strange folk tales, and even members of my family who held defiant stances against the paranormal world, but had inexplicably experienced strange things, I grew up with an eager attention towards these things, but definitely do not hold any strong beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I have experienced some weird things that may interest some of you, and I intend to write a few of them up. Just because. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular situation is just what happened, I&amp;#39;m implying nothing nor making any assumptions/ conclusions. Just writing it up as it happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 5 years back, I lived with my father in the UK over summer while awaiting my uni to start again in September. It was a relatively newish house in a nice residential area of a large town. The house was at the top of a hill and nearby was a small graveyard. I had my PC set up in our dining room, on the table placed so I had my back facing the large bay window. That night my father was away somewhere and it was just me and my step mother at home. At this point she was in bed and it was quite late, definitely after midnight. I got a text that he would be back in around an hour/ two hours time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing he was coming home later, while just browsing stuff I heard a tap on the window. I instantly assumed it was my father having returned super early. I turned round and couldn&amp;#39;t see anyone but this didn&amp;#39;t shake the idea that he must have been home and wanted me to open the door for him. Bare in mind this was the back of the house, so in the adjoining kitchen there was a back door, only about 5 foot away from the edge of the bay windows, so it made sense for him to be tapping on the window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get up, go to the kitchen, open the door and find no-one there. I figured &amp;quot;oh well, strange occurrence&amp;quot; and shrugged it off. It was a nice night though, so I just stood in the doorway for a minute and looked at the stars. It was only a minute, but suddenly, exactly where I was looking, I saw a weird shape flash across the sky. It was like a shooting star but it very rapidly sped in the same shape a heartbeat monitor makes when it blips up and down, only from right to left instead. As in it travelled in a line from the right, shot up, then directly down, then back up halfway and off again in a straight line. I felt like I watched it move but it went so fast that I basically saw the whole shape in one instance. It was about as long as your finger would cover at arm&amp;#39;s length. Again I just thought it was weird. Immediately after, I heard stuff move on the kitchen counter directly behind me. In fact, it made the exact noise of the kettle being placed on its base. So similarly that I just 100% believed my step mother had woken and was putting the kettle on. I spoke to greet her and turned around, only to find the room empty and still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was weird, but I left things alone and went back to my PC. The night ended normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the next bit is hard to describe effectively, and in my opinion is both more explicable but understandably hard to believe. It may also be totally unrelated to the first half of this story. Over the next 2-3 weeks I was harassed by a tiny shape. I remember it starting almost immediately after that night, but in no way can remember specific time frames. We had a piano in that same dining room, and in the middle of the day I was sat playing it. While playing it, I started seeing this little shadow, about 5-6 inches tall, dart behind things. For instance, I would see it in my peripheral hide behind my leg. Or I would be looking at the piano and notice it move behind a picture frame on top. It did not stay exclusively in my peripheral, it would sometimes move around quite close to the center of my vision, but just in areas I wasn&amp;#39;t directly focusing on. It wouldn&amp;#39;t move across large stretches at first either, more just I would notice it quickly hide behind things as if it had been peeking out and I hadn&amp;#39;t previously noticed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember while playing the piano this first time, over this 10 minute window it happened over and over to the point where I became really frustrated and tense. It wasn&amp;#39;t frightening at all but so frustrating that it began stressing me out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened as I said for about 3 weeks. In this time I also moved out of my father&amp;#39;s house and into my new student house. I was happy to be back with my friends in a free environment, but was still kept on edge by this constant shadow. I didn&amp;#39;t mention it to anyone for the duration it happened for. It escalated at one point to where I would be sitting in a room and see it fly around the ceiling and hide behind lightshades like a bat flitting about. In the few times I clearly remember seeing it, I was alone, although it may have happened a few times with other people in the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then just as it started, it suddenly stopped. And that was it. I was left alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accepted it and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the first of my potential incidents. Sorry for length but I didn&amp;#39;t want to split these two instances up, as I generally consider them as one incident. I know of people who experience stress through weird visual hallucinations. I suppose it could have been this, although I don&amp;#39;t remember being stressed at that time, nor for that long a period, and have never experienced anything similar.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"hello, I don't really post a lot on reddit but there's been this noise I've been hearing for awhile. 

Background: I just recently moved to Wisconsin from Texas for an education. I've been here for about 6 months, and me and my girlfriend have heard this sound late at night. 

It sounds like a tire screeching sound, except everytime we hear it it's the same sound. It's high pitched and it's an ascending and it lasts about a second or two. It echoes a bit afterwards, and it's so loud. Normally if a tire is screeching it's not so loud to be heard in a place where there are not that many cars. When me and my girlfriend are out at night it's very late, where there are no cars. I've heard it over a dozen times, but for some reason this sound makes me paranoid and dissociative.  I have heard it before in Texas, but not as often as I hear it here. 

I know for a fact it's not an animal because it sounds almost mechanical and I've listened to about every animal that makes late at night sounds and they don't match at all. (But I am still open for suggestions, it's not a fox, it's not Bigfoot, and it's not the screeching owl either) Secondly, I live in a downtown inner city area where there is little to no forest, or animals for that matter. Yet I still hear this noise. 

If you know of this noise, or perhaps it's whereabouts please let me know. This sound brings me a lot of anxiety, paranoia and sends me into a dissociative state if I think about it too much. But I need to know if other people hear this outside of Wisconsin (my roommates and their friends have also heard this sound.)
