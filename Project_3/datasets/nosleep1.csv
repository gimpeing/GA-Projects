,nosleep,"42 years, 6 months and 3 days ago, on the 5th of September 1977, a space probe was launched from Earth, and sent on an endless journey through space. The probe, which was affectionately named Voyager 1, contains a multitude of information regarding humanity, including our language, our art, and in a more metaphorical way; Our souls.  


Today, the little machine is 22 billion kilometers away from Earth, the furthest reach of our species, though not a manned vessel, it's still a part of us. Despite its distance, we're still keeping contact with it, and during it's journey spanning almost half a century, it has given us an insight into the mysteries of the universe we thought we could only dream about. 


My own father spent most of his life on the project, and I have since followed in his footsteps. I dreamed about taking over his work even as a twelve year old kid, and eventually, these dreams would land me at NASA's doorstep.


Little did I know, that only a few years into my work, the one question that has plagued us since the dawn of mankind, would be answered, forever changing the course of human history. 


“Are we alone?”


***


On the 7th of December 2019, I arrived to the office after having been called in at four in the morning. I immediately noticed the panic that had erupted over night, with my coworkers scurrying around the office, confused, horrified, but seemingly excited about a picture sent from Voyager 1. 


The monitors that usually displayed little more than numbers and boring graphs, now all showed the same, singular image; That of a blue planet. I approached one of the screens, and studied the photograph. In many ways, the planet resembled Earth, with vast blue oceans, and split landmasses, but none of the continents were recognizable to me, and the clouds hovering above were red, with a vague, yellow tint. 


“Hey, Dan, what's this?” I asked my neighboring coworker. 


At first he barely noticed my presence, too engrossed in his own work as he stared at the screen with a mixture of terror and anticipation. 


“Hey, what's the picture?” I repeated. 


“It came from Voyager 1,” he said, barely a whisper. 


It was a ludicrous statement. The last image sent from Voyager 1 had been received in 1990, the famous ['Pale Blue Dot,'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg) an image we'd posted on the wall of our office for inspiration. Since that fateful day, our engineers turned the camera off to save the probe's memory, assuring we could still receive more valuable data in the future. 


“Don't be stupid, that's impossible,” I said, “they turned the camera off decades ago.”


“Something – something turned it back on,” he said with a shaky voice. 


His choice of words confused me. Instead of indicating that a person had done it, he said 'something.'


“What do you mean? How is that even possible?”


“I don't know, but the signal that turned it on came from the planet on the picture. It overrode the system, effectively hijacking the probe.”


I looked back at the picture, noting its bright surface, an impossible image without a nearby star to light it up, but according to all available data, Voyager 1 should have been several light years away from the nearest star.


“The signal came from within the Oort cloud,” Dan mumbled. 


“Excuse me?”


“I know, it's three hundred years ahead of schedule. We rechecked it five times, it doesn't make any sense.”


Before I could ask any further questions, my supervisor called me into the main office. There, he showed me the transmission we'd received from Voyager 1. Apparently it wasn't just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. 


“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. 


“Well, that's why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”


My Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. 


However, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.
 

Then it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn't just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we'd received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. 


We spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. 


Without hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.


Though we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don't understand, but what follows is the basics of what we've deciphered so far:


December 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”


March 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”


October 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”


September 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” 


Though the direct messages didn't make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can't even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”


Since the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. 


The more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn't one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...


Yet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn't calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.


Instead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:

,nosleep,"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))

The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  

For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.

It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.

I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.

I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.

Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.

I wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.

It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?

Yeah.  I fucked up.

There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.

I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.

We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.

I went to see the man with no shadow.

A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.

The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.

I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.

He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.

“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”

He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.

“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.

I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.

“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”

The man with no shadow laughed.  

“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”

He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.

“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.

Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. 

I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.

“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”

“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.

“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”

He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.

“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”

The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.

It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.

“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.

“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”

He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.

“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”

He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.

And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.

I’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.

The rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.

Unless, of course, someone killed him.

What a shame that would be.

Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.

There was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.

The man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.

“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”

“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”

I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.

He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.

“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”

His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  

Did I do this to him? 

He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.

The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.

“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”

I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.

But the not-brother sure as hell is.

I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.

“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.

“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”

And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.

“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”

Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.

Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.

I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.

I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.

Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.

The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.

Maybe it is, around here.

I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.

I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.

“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”

“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”

The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.

The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.

See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.

But now…

They all saw him for what he was.

“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”

He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.

I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.

And it didn’t matter.

He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.

I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.

Guns and dogs.

And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.

The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.

The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.

The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.

I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.

Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  

They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.

I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.

I guess it doesn’t matter now.

I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.

I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.

At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/""&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fight Bryan took over running errands for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to see the man with no shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man with no shadow laughed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, someone killed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a shame that would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.

&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I do this to him? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the not-brother sure as hell is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is, around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a &lt;em&gt;concussion&lt;/em&gt; recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being around humans.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guns and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.&lt;/p&gt;

We left the garage after an hour, taking the time to plan and prepare for whatever may be out there. Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. 

Chloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. 

“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. 

“Haven’t seen it myself. Only heard second hand from others. They said after so long in here people just begin to... morph. Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”

We both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. 

“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.

There was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. 

“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”

I grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. 
“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. 

“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”

We moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. 

*THUNK*

I hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. 

“Run.” Chloe whispered.

I looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. 

Adrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. 

“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”

When we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. 

“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. 

One of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. 

“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”

Her voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. 

The feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. 

“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. 

“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”

“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. 

She simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. 

“Think you can climb?” She asked.

“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. 

We set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. 

A knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. 

“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”

As he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon.

&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Think you can climb?” She asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://thehorrorstore.home.blog""&gt;“He’s turning.” Chloe whispered. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.

Today I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.

“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.

“Lughnasadh.”

“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”

“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”

“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.

“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.

“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”

“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.

A wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.

“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.

“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”

“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I *dying?*

“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”

My mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.

She stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.

“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.

“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.

“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”

*Sarah?*

“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”

I could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.

“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”

I couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.

“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.

Short, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.

That limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …

However, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.

The poor idiot.

“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”

“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”

*I don’t know, Mike,* I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. *Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?*

A wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.

Man, I was losing a lot of blood.

Amy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.

Mike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.

Poor handsome idiot.

“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”

Mike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.

“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.

“Hey, is … is this blood?”

“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.

Mike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.

She withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.

She inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.

But I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.

For the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.

When the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me *she* would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.

Maybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.

When she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.

She took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.

The crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.

Taking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.

I just didn’t want to leave her.

With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.

***

I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.

Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?

I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.

No, that wasn’t right. 

I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.

Why was the shower weird?

Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.

The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?

I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.

Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.

My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.

Amy had stabbed me.

Actually stabbed me.

To death. What the hell?

I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.

“You stabbed me!”

Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”

“You *stabbed* me.”

“I did.”

“Why the hell did you stab me!”

“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”

“But you *stabbed* me!”

“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”

I still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … 

“I’m taller.”

She beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.

“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”

I lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”

“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”

I sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”

I was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.

“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”

&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t want to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, that wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was the shower weird?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy had stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To death. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You stabbed me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you stab me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But you &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m taller.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ll be damned if &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy""&gt;she didn’t have a point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"My cat is acting a bit… off. She’s a rescue so, of course, she’s got a couple kinks to work out. This is a little more than that, though. 


She started by scratching the walls, completely disregarding the perfectly good scratching post right next to her. It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though. Just a simple matter of repainting. 


Then, she started pissing on the floors, even though she had a perfectly good litter box that I cleaned daily. And they weren’t just your average, cat-sized urine puddles. These were massive. Impossibly large for the size of my cat. I was perplexed at the size and unsure of how to curb this behavior. I tried doing a google search, checking pet owner forums, but all of the remedies I found didn’t seem to help at all. 


Was it something I was going to just have to accept and live with? Maybe another way of marking her territory or a strange thing she picked up from the previous owner?


I didn’t know anything about the cat before I brought her home. She was pretty small, somewhat malnourished and skittish, but overall seemed to be a pretty loving cat. I figured she came from an abusive or neglectful home. I tried not to think too much about her life before me. As far as I was concerned, she had always been my cat. 


Then, the night time wailing began. I know what you’re thinking, cats go crazy at night, it’s a known fact. And that is true, but something about the way she meowed. The way she seemed to be calling out to something in groans that sounded more like some sort of lost language than a cat’s meow, that sent shivers down my spine. 


It was something that resembled a song. Rhythmic and repeating over and over again, all through the night. I’d just ignore it, forcing myself to lay in bed and accept what was happening just beyond my bedroom door. If I wasn’t able to fall asleep, which seemed like it was just about every night, I’d have a little bit of chemical help in the form of ambien. The magic little sleeping pill that made me go lights-out in 20 minutes, flat. 


I’d wake up in the morning to dead mice, rats and even rabbits placed just outside of my bedroom door. Not my front door, no. These would be inside my house, sitting right outside my door as I stepped out in the morning to make a cup of coffee. 


The first one was unexpected and, naturally, I stepped right on it’s detached head. It crunched beneath my feet, sending brain matter, blood and viscera shooting up between my toes and oozing out of the cracks. I nearly vomited, barely holding it back as I launched myself toward the bathroom. 


I searched my house up and down for any way she might have been escaping. A cracked window or perhaps the dryer vent wasn’t secured properly. After hours of searching, I came up with nothing. My house was sealed tight. There was no way for her to escape. 


I thought that maybe she was just doing her job. She was a predator, after all. And she seemed to be a damn good hunter who kept my house free of unwanted critters and pests. 


I could live with that. 


I learned to keep an eye out as I exited my bedroom in the morning. Like clockwork, I’d wake up and exit my room at 7am and there they were. Like little gifts, their heads torn clean off their bodies and placed carefully to the side. My cat would simply sit on the armrest of my couch, watching and purring happily. It even looked like she had a little smile on her face. 


It was the cutest thing to see her so happy. So proud of herself that she was completing her task so efficiently. 


The next gift she left me was a bit bigger. 


When I stepped out of my room, in my normal routine just like any other day, I was greeted by a scene of gruesome horror. Blood splashed on my walls, caked on all my furniture and pooled up just in front of my door. 


My arms began shaking with a rush of anxiety that took hold of me and refused to let go. My breath became short and my heart threatened to leap from my chest. 


When I looked over at my cat, she seemed pleased, like any other day. She purred happily, staring at me with a Cheshire Cat grin smug on her face. She was coated in bright red blood and had something floppy dangling from her mouth. 


When I looked down at the “gift” she had brought me, I nearly collapsed. My legs began to wobble, my vision blurred and a deep seated panic settled in my bones. 


It was my neighbor, Bill. He was lying on my floor. Just like every other “gift” she’d left me, he was placed meticulously on the floor with his head torn from his neck. 


I stared in frozen shock for what seemed like hours. A quick “meow” from my cat brought me back to my senses. 


This time, I wasn’t able to hold the bile in my stomach. This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill's dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. 


It was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.


No one would. 


After scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. 


I started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. 


The blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. 


After hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”


I heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. 


“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”


Oh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. 


She’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. 


“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. 


I examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. 


I ran out and opened the door. 


“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” 


“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. 


When she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. 


She turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. 


“New couch?” She asked.


“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”


I walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.


My heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. 


She made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say.

""Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.""

I don't know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don't know them, but they know me.

Did they know her?

I look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.

I don't know why I just did that. Maybe I'll do it again.

My mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don't know why he isn't with mom right now. I'm still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.

I stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don't know why they're here in the first place. I don't know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.

Pictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.

A boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven't seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.

Dad's hunched over the sink. He's not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.

There's a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There's a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.

The first room I see is open. There're people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It's wood. Inside is something I couldn't get down from the shower in time. Granny's in there, and she's leading the rosary. The people she's praying with have never met my family. They're dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven't opened it yet. They're all staying in granny's hotel. I don't think they've ever been to this village before.

One of the people turns to me, frowning. He's a black man. There's no one of his skin color in this village, but there's plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She'd want to be buried over there, not here.

The man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she's fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She's dressed in a beautiful white dress.

""Boy,"" the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister's, ""this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.""

I glance at her. She's still praying. Her eyes haven't even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.

The black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn't there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.

I can still feel it.

I look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. ""Caoimhe,"" he said, turning to my grandmother, ""Caoimhe, your grandson is here."" I'm impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.

Granny's eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. ""Oh, Ned,"" she says, ""Ned, please come and sit beside me.""

I don't say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can't tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.

""Ned,"" she says, ""I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it's like to lose someone you've grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to..."" She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.

I take my chance and sit up, but I don't leave. I walk up to the open casket.

My sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody's paying any attention to me.

""Jenny,"" I say in a whisper, ""Jenny, can... can you hear me?""

She keeps her lips pressed together.

""Jenny,"" I say again, still whispering, ""Jenny, it's me. It's your little brother.""

Jenny doesn't say anything.

""Jenny,"" I whisper, ""I can't do this. I... I can't do this."" My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.

""Jenny, I need you,"" I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, ""I need my big sister.""

Jenny doesn't open her eyes.

""Please wake up,"" I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.

She's the coldest thing I've ever touched in my life.

I can't be here. Men don't cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I'm done, I don't feel like crying anymore. I'm swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don't care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don't care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They're also crying.

I can't cry. I'm the man here. I can't cry. I can't do it. I can't be okay.

My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren't my friends here? Do I still have friends?

I blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn't my house. I'm in the city, not the village. There's still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny's sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.

I want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn't say anything. It's not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny's wake and subsequent funeral. I think he's the man who tried to make me support my granny.

I read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.

I'm naked and look at the bed. No one's in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don't know. They might as well be dead.

I don't get dressed until I've drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven't flushed since last night, and don't brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn't I save them?

I burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I'm still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I'm drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.

I blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It's the man from Jenny's funeral. He's wearing an orange jumpsuit. There's a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.

Then I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They've changed. Where's granda? I don't see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.

""I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord's Chosen,"" she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, ""he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.""

""What?"" I say aloud then walk up to the bar. ""Hey, can you turn that up?"" I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. ""That's my family on there."" His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.

I stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn't need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.

Then it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he'd visited.

My heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.

Jenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.

It can't be. It's impossible. There's no way that... no way that this man... ""Who is that?"" I ask when the black man is on the screen again.

""Calls himself the Prophet,"" the barman says, ""cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.""

""Prophet,"" I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.

Hadn't he asked to help invite people he thought would ""help"" with the funeral?

Was he why my friends hadn't come to the funeral?

Why had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he'd never met?

Why had he booked a room at granny's hotel?

Why had he pushed me toward her?

Why had he been in the same room as my sister's body?

Why had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?

The newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all ""good followers of the Way"" to help her in freeing her beloved.

A picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.

That bastard.

That. Utter. Bastard.

I shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.

There's pictures of my home village on the screen. It's not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, ""Prophet, prophet,"" they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left

That isn't the village I grew up in.

That's what was built on top of it.

""Did they say where he's being held?"" I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.

""No,"" the bartender said softly, ""but... look, son, I think I know what's going through your head.""

I looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.

""Don't do it. Don't go down that road. There's no going back. I know it hurts, but you don't want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It'll destroy you.""

""It already has,"" I say softly, ""and it's gotten my family now."" My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I'm not going to work. I've got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I've got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.

I know where the Prophet will be. He'll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn't.

I don&amp;#39;t drink. I don&amp;#39;t know why I picked it up. I haven&amp;#39;t tried it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The casket is upstairs. I haven&amp;#39;t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I&amp;#39;m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-awful thing to happen-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was so young, it didn&amp;#39;t look like anything was wrong-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-I hope the family will be okay-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-No, I don&amp;#39;t know why she did it-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that the boy who found her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aye, he&amp;#39;s been sitting there since they came back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don&amp;#39;t know them, but they know me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granny&amp;#39;s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. &amp;quot;Oh, Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;Ned, please come and sit beside me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She keeps her lips pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say again, still whispering, &amp;quot;Jenny, it&amp;#39;s me. It&amp;#39;s your little brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I whisper, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do this. I... I can&amp;#39;t do this.&amp;quot; My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, I need you,&amp;quot; I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, &amp;quot;I need my big sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s the coldest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever touched in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be here. Men don&amp;#39;t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t cry. I&amp;#39;m the man here. I can&amp;#39;t cry. I can&amp;#39;t do it. I can&amp;#39;t be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren&amp;#39;t my friends here? Do I still have friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord&amp;#39;s Chosen,&amp;quot; she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, &amp;quot;he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I say aloud then walk up to the bar. &amp;quot;Hey, can you turn that up?&amp;quot; I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my family on there.&amp;quot; His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn&amp;#39;t need to grieve her daughter anymore.

&lt;p&gt;My heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s impossible. There&amp;#39;s no way that... no way that this man... &amp;quot;Who is that?&amp;quot; I ask when the black man is on the screen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Calls himself the Prophet,&amp;quot; the barman says, &amp;quot;cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Prophet,&amp;quot; I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hadn&amp;#39;t he asked to help invite people he thought would &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; with the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was he why my friends hadn&amp;#39;t come to the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he&amp;#39;d never met?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why had he booked a room at granny&amp;#39;s hotel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why had he pushed me toward her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why had he been in the same room as my sister&amp;#39;s body?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all &amp;quot;good followers of the Way&amp;quot; to help her in freeing her beloved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s pictures of my home village on the screen. It&amp;#39;s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, &amp;quot;Prophet, prophet,&amp;quot; they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t the village I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what was built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did they say where he&amp;#39;s being held?&amp;quot; I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; the bartender said softly, &amp;quot;but... look, son, I think I know what&amp;#39;s going through your head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it. Don&amp;#39;t go down that road. There&amp;#39;s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don&amp;#39;t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It&amp;#39;ll destroy you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It already has,&amp;quot; I say softly, &amp;quot;and it&amp;#39;s gotten my family now.&amp;quot; My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I&amp;#39;m not going to work. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know where the Prophet will be. He&amp;#39;ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time for a homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;

“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. 

I felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.

“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”

“…*can you hear the screams.*” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.

I knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”

“…*I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home*?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “*I can’t see. Please, can I go home?*”

Alzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.

“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.

“*I can’t see…*”

“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. 

Mr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”

I released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”

His language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.

“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.

“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.

“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”

I fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. 

Though I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. 

I googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.

""**FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!**

*LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-""*

There were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.

Mr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: *Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.*

A little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.

The Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.

In 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…

I was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. 

Come 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.

A woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… 

I asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.

“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.

“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“

“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. 

“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“

“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” 

His tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”

The line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”

“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”

I hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”

“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”

“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?

“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”

“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“

“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”

I was stunned into silence.

“If you're a journalist, you're a bad one, but I don't believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”

The shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”

There was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO's, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. 

A dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. 

I went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.

“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”

I acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. 

As luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.

I delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.

“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.

“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”

His eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.

Though he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….

Slowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.

Mr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. 

I took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.

They parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.

Mr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. 

I backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.

Finally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.

I hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.

Stunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.

The image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…

I glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze.

&lt;p&gt;How much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.&lt;/p&gt;

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/)

It was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.

“I saw her again, Mike. I saw *her*.”

“Who babe? Who did you see?”

“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”

“Are you...are you sure it was her?”

“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”

“Umm, were you able to honk?”

“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was *broken*. It didn’t make a sound.”

Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.

“Julia, what are you worried about?""

""That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.""

""Aww babe, you don't think that was actually real do you?"" My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.

""I don't know. I've seen it twice now and we couldn't turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I'm still freaking out.""

""Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, *I'm* the one that should be worrying.

\###

I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.

""I've been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,"" she whispered into my ear. ""I want you.""

I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.

We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.

""That was great,"" she said.

""Tell me about it.""

""Can you go again?""

""*Now*?""

""Yeah, why not?""

""But I just...I mean."" I didn't want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.

""How about if I…you know,"" she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.

That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.

After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn't a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with *this*. This was insanity. She still wanted more.

I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.

\###

I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.

*She's in the bathroom,* I thought.

But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn't returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?

I called her name and didn't get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Couldn't sleep. Went down to Rusty's. Didn't want to wake you.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Love, Julia""

Rusty's Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia's place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.

I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn't like Julia and it wasn't safe for her to walk down here alone at night.

""Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.""

He gave me an incredulous look. ""Maybe. Who wants to know?""

""I do. Look, here's her picture."" I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.

He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.

“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say *I’d* want to know. Your girlfriend *was* here and—”

“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.

“Excuse me?”

“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”

“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.

“What?”

“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don't have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”

My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.

Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never *walked* in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.

I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.

There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.

The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.

Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.

The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.

I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises *she* made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.

That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”

But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.

Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.

“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.

She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.

I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.

Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.

\###

I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.

I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.

After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.

This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other *thing* almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, ""Julia I think you should get some help"", and blocked her number.

\###

Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.

“Man, that was so messed up what she did. *Fucked* up. You deserve better.”

“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”

“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”

“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”

“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”

“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”

“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”

I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.

But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.

Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.

\###

I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.

“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”

“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”

He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.

“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”

He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.

I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.

“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. *Sick*.”

“I had heard she went in-patient.”

He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t *blame* her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.

I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”

“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you *if* you came by.”

He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”

I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  
&gt;  
&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but *you* can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Love Always,  
&gt;  
&gt;Julia

The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.

I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.

I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.

*What if it’s not her?*

*What if she ignores me?*

*What if she screams and runs?*

But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.

\###

In a featureless motel room we lay.

She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.

In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.

She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. *We* were back. That was all I needed.

“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”

“What?” I asked.

She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?

“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.

In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.

“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.

“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”

“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”

“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”

She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”

My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.

“Babe, what did you take?”

“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”

“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please."" I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. ""I’m calling 911.”

She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”

“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?""

“Michael. You’re here to make *sure* I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.

She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”

\###

“So that’s what’s been going on,” *Michael told me*. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”

*“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.*

“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”

*“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”*

“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—*had* a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”

*“Michael,” I said urgently.* “*Do not.”*

“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”

*I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.*

“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”

*“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”*

“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”

*“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”*

\###

*I didn't need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn't need to know what he did or rather* didn't *do, because I'm the one that suggested it to him.*

*I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.*

*They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.*

*What if there could be some sort of compromise?*

*I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that's what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.*

*I saw it in the headlines a few days later,* **Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.** *Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.*

*I've asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?*

*“Sure,” they said.*

*""Infinitesimal, but yeah,"" they said.*

*Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?*

*""Are you serious right now?"" they asked.*

*If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?*

*“No,” they said.*

*“Impossible,” they said.*

&lt;p&gt;It was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw her again, Mike. I saw &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who babe? Who did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you...are you sure it was her?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Umm, were you able to honk?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;. It didn’t make a sound.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Julia, what are you worried about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww babe, you don&amp;#39;t think that was actually real do you?&amp;quot; My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve seen it twice now and we couldn&amp;#39;t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I&amp;#39;m still freaking out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the one that should be worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,&amp;quot; she whispered into my ear. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was great,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you go again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, why not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I just...I mean.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about if I…you know,&amp;quot; she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn&amp;#39;t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. This was insanity. She still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s in the bathroom,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn&amp;#39;t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called her name and didn&amp;#39;t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. Went down to Rusty&amp;#39;s. Didn&amp;#39;t want to wake you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Love, Julia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rusty&amp;#39;s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia&amp;#39;s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn&amp;#39;t like Julia and it wasn&amp;#39;t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave me an incredulous look. &amp;quot;Maybe. Who wants to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do. Look, here&amp;#39;s her picture.&amp;quot; I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; want to know. Your girlfriend &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; here and—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never &lt;em&gt;walked&lt;/em&gt; in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, &amp;quot;Julia I think you should get some help&amp;quot;, and blocked her number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Man, that was so messed up what she did. &lt;em&gt;Fucked&lt;/em&gt; up. You deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had heard she went in-patient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you came by.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love Always,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if it’s not her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she ignores me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she screams and runs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a featureless motel room we lay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; were back. That was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Babe, what did you take?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.&amp;quot; I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. &amp;quot;I’m calling 911.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Michael. You’re here to make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So that’s what’s been going on,” &lt;em&gt;Michael told me&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael,” I said urgently.&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Do not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn&amp;#39;t need to know what he did or rather&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;do, because I&amp;#39;m the one that suggested it to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there could be some sort of compromise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that&amp;#39;s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw it in the headlines a few days later,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Infinitesimal, but yeah,&amp;quot; they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Are you serious right now?&amp;quot; they asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Impossible,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep," 

I studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.

Not a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.

Purgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.

10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.

The stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.

He led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.

I begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.

The game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”

I pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.

I began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.

This was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.

I panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it.

[Part Three](https://redd.it/f5gpg9)

**** 

“Are you ready to begin?”

I flinched at the words as I looked up at the man seated across from me.  He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.

The man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.

“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”

I frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”

The man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”

“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”

The man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t *want* to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”

“What?  What *are* you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”

This time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”

I nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”

“What do you think happened to her?”

I felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.

But then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.

“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”

The man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”

I didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”

Burke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.

“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”

Another satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”

“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”

Burke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you *think* is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”

I took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”

The man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”

Burke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”

I felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.

But below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.

“*You.*”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”

Burke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”

I felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”

The man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  

My head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”

Burke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against *you*, aren’t they, Daniel?  *You* certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  *You* didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, *did* you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”

Closing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  

I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  

Trying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.

“No.”

“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”

“No.”

“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”

“*No.*”

Burke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.

“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”

I could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.

As I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.

The sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.

This immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…

Suddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.

That meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.

[And now the man was killing him.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)",t2_11d38ddb,False,,0,False,It Pulls You Down.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you ready to begin?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flinched at the words as I looked up at the man seated across from me.  He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?  What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you think happened to her?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You.&lt;/em&gt;”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t they, Daniel?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.

And now it wants to finish the job.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.&lt;/p&gt;

I slowly moved my hand, and held on to what I could make out, was its hand. I fought for control over my own body, I don't even know if it's me that's moving anymore, someone please, help me. Please help-

""Don't do it, kid!""

Mr. Smith, Mr. McWright's associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it's footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could've happened to me, if it wasn't for Mr. Smith.

It was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn't for me, he would've still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn't the principal speaking.

We heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?
These things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?

I hadn't realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I'd come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn't that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?

It was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.

""I'm next.""

I opened the door, and saw that there wasn't only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I'm next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they're everywhere.

I saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. 

""OP! Where are your classmates? Aren't they supposed to be here? Didn't the principal all tell you?""

The principal? Wasn't the principal already dead?

""Hey Finn, where's your homeroom adviser?""

""Dead, we'd rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn't seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one's much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.""

""I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?""

I presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.

We brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.

We were outsmarted, Finn's other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.

And then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.

I can't feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn't feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn't move, couldn't do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it's eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I've ever felt. I'm bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.

I could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don't even feel human anymore. Was I going insane? My head was feeling tingly, it stopped doing things to my leg, and I could feel my body again. But it was different, I felt hazy, slightly, comfortable. Something in my head kept moving around, it reached the top of my skull.

And it burst itself out.

I'm one of them now.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it, kid!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith, Mr. McWright&amp;#39;s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it&amp;#39;s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could&amp;#39;ve happened to me, if it wasn&amp;#39;t for Mr. Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn&amp;#39;t for me, he would&amp;#39;ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn&amp;#39;t the principal speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?
These things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I&amp;#39;d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn&amp;#39;t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m next.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the door, and saw that there wasn&amp;#39;t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I&amp;#39;m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they&amp;#39;re everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OP! Where are your classmates? Aren&amp;#39;t they supposed to be here? Didn&amp;#39;t the principal all tell you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal? Wasn&amp;#39;t the principal already dead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Finn, where&amp;#39;s your homeroom adviser?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dead, we&amp;#39;d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one&amp;#39;s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were outsmarted, Finn&amp;#39;s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn&amp;#39;t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn&amp;#39;t move, couldn&amp;#39;t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it&amp;#39;s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I&amp;#39;ve ever felt. I&amp;#39;m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don&amp;#39;t even feel human anymore. Was I going insane? My head was feeling tingly, it stopped doing things to my leg, and I could feel my body again. But it was different, I felt hazy, slightly, comfortable. Something in my head kept moving around, it reached the top of my skull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it burst itself out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m one of them now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must do what I have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must.&lt;/p&gt;

Scrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.

The last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.

What I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.

But first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”

&amp;#x200B;

I was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.

I was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.

The church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.

As I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.

Philippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.

The Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.

I asked the old priest about this.

“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.""

The first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.

But one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.

The sheep came back eventually.

Her mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.

Hopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.

Months went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.

The bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.

The townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.

I had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:

“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”

Time went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.

What struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.

A bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.

Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.

But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.

Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.

The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.

On the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.

On the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.

It was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.

A dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.

At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.

The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.

Anyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.

It was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.

Something emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.

Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.

The grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.

At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.

The soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.

Three days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.

*“Grand succès !”* He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.

It was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.

I learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.

A few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.

I was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.

I thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.

I was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.

Now that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.

And yet the door opened. And there it was.

In the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.

The silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... 

In the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.

A voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.

They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheep came back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Grand succès !”&lt;/em&gt; He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet the door opened. And there it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo homini lupus.&lt;/em&gt; Man is a wolf to man.&lt;/p&gt;

________

The world died in 1908. 

That’s how it felt when the explosion ripped across the sky. I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. 
It was actually far worse. 

My father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. 

We should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. 

I remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. 

As we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. 

Suddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.

My father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. 

I waited an hour. Then two. 

They never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. 

But these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. 

I ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. 

Instead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. 

The next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. 

10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. 

Suddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. 

My mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. 

“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. 

Instead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.

Becoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. 

Treading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. 

Some of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. 

Instead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. 

“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. 

Thankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. 

“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. 

The farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. 

And when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. 

Thanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. 

When we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. 
These were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. 

My hunting party didn’t see it that way though. Instead the scientists began to chatter amongst themselves about how they could sell the beasts to circus and become millionaires. It made my blood boil, and in a rage I struck. 

Some of the scientists fought back, but I was too strong. The heat of the moment was past and I realized I had killed them all. 

My father’s pained and misshapen face looked at me and we both realized I couldn’t return to civilization now. Not as a murderer. 

So instead I made those men a promise. 

“I will protect you,” I told them, offering them the corpses as food. The monsters were grateful and after the meat was torn from the scientist’s body, they tossed the rest into a large hole and gestured for me to follow into the mountain. 

In such a remote wilderness, over the years we have found it easy to stay hidden. I watched as scientists came and left trying to study the after effects of the crater. I realized also I had been given some of these as a result of simply being close to my father and the others. They have become less and less human over the years, unable to die and tormented by their ghastly appearance and their mental deterioration. 

I have tried to help them as best as I can, moving them to stay hidden and hunting food here in the Siberian waste. But we will never again be a part of the world that we once knew. I died that day when the sky split. I’ve lived as a ghost ever since. 

I tell all of this knowing now that I likely will be losing touch of my own sensibilities soon, the effects of the meteorite finally taking its full toll on me. And then living as a monster, likely for the rest of eternity. 

Once my own mind is gone, nothing will prevents these creatures from venturing beyond isolation. From finding life that can be used to hunt and to kill and to infect others. 

All I can say is that we are sorry, we cannot control this curse that has been with us all these years. If you do encounter us, my only advice would be to run.

&lt;p&gt;“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. 
These were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hunting party didn’t see it that way though. Instead the scientists began to chatter amongst themselves about how they could sell the beasts to circus and become millionaires. It made my blood boil, and in a rage I struck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the scientists fought back, but I was too strong. The heat of the moment was past and I realized I had killed them all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father’s pained and misshapen face looked at me and we both realized I couldn’t return to civilization now. Not as a murderer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead I made those men a promise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will protect you,” I told them, offering them the corpses as food. The monsters were grateful and after the meat was torn from the scientist’s body, they tossed the rest into a large hole and gestured for me to follow into the mountain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a remote wilderness, over the years we have found it easy to stay hidden. I watched as scientists came and left trying to study the after effects of the crater. I realized also I had been given some of these as a result of simply being close to my father and the others. They have become less and less human over the years, unable to die and tormented by their ghastly appearance and their mental deterioration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to help them as best as I can, moving them to stay hidden and hunting food here in the Siberian waste. But we will never again be a part of the world that we once knew. I died that day when the sky split. I’ve lived as a ghost ever since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell all of this knowing now that I likely will be losing touch of my own sensibilities soon, the effects of the meteorite finally taking its full toll on me. And then living as a monster, likely for the rest of eternity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my own mind is gone, nothing will prevents these creatures from venturing beyond isolation. From finding life that can be used to hunt and to kill and to infect others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that we are sorry, we cannot control this curse that has been with us all these years. If you do encounter us, my only advice would be to run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/mWVPG8czpI4""&gt;Run and hide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn't have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.

I met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.

Our college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. 

That is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.

Ryan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he's okay, to which he replied: ""Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something..."". Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with ""What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?"" He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn't want to press it.

Over the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn't come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn't home he didn't come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.

One day when he wasn't home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what's up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn't break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said ""You need to return. It is time"" and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...

&amp;#x200B;

Months went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.

Fast forward to two years later.

After I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...

That was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn't remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan's voice, so clearly, saying ""You need to return. It is time."".

I woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn't get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan's words...

&amp;#x200B;

The same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn't get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. 

\- Hello?

No answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.

Just like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.

One night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: ""You need to return. It is time."" 

My brain couldn't exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn't, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.

Months passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.

 That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan's strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.

\- Hello?

\- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don't remember but It's me. Jessica.

Strange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?

\- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?

\- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.

\- What? What are you talking abou-

\-  You need to return. It is time.

Then she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.

Ever since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan's family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan's mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn't ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.

Days passed. I patiently waited for the cops to ""solve the mystery"". Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn't do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. 

I thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...

I booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said ""Ok"" and didn't ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.

That night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he ""finished his task"" and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. "" I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth."" then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.

&amp;#x200B;

Streets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn't notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent's graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called ""the enlightenment"" to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. ""You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it's confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time."" he said before disappering into the void...

I woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn't procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...""ok"" and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I'd say they normally would ask more questions. 

It was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. 

It took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: "" Read the book and you will know everything.""

It was the quickest and biggest ""nope"" of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan's body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.

A few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn't pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.

\- Hello?

A familiar voice spoke:

\- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I've done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...

Hung up.

I thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the ""consequences""? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.

&amp;#x200B;

More than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn't see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: ""Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute"". I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. ""Emma, are you in there?"" No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.

I opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:

&lt;p&gt;Then she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan&amp;#39;s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan&amp;#39;s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days passed. I patiently waited for the cops to &amp;quot;solve the mystery&amp;quot;. Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn&amp;#39;t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; and didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he &amp;quot;finished his task&amp;quot; and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. &amp;quot; I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.&amp;quot; then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn&amp;#39;t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent&amp;#39;s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called &amp;quot;the enlightenment&amp;quot; to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. &amp;quot;You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it&amp;#39;s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.&amp;quot; he said before disappering into the void...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn&amp;#39;t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I&amp;#39;d say they normally would ask more questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: &amp;quot; Read the book and you will know everything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the quickest and biggest &amp;quot;nope&amp;quot; of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan&amp;#39;s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A familiar voice spoke:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I&amp;#39;ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hung up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the &amp;quot;consequences&amp;quot;? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn&amp;#39;t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: &amp;quot;Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute&amp;quot;. I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. &amp;quot;Emma, are you in there?&amp;quot; No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now the price is paid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

According to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (or NamUs), it is estimated that more than 600,000 people go missing in the United States alone every year. Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. 

Everyone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. 

When it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. 

My eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.

Only I knew better. 

As I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. 

My gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. 

The dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. 

The sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. 

But again, I knew better. 

I interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. 

Rustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. 

“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. 

“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. 

Before I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. 

“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. 

As I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. 

“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. 

Almost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. 

“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. 

Douglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. 

Sean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. 

Douglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. 

This time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” 

We learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. 

“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” 

The rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. 

“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. 

Rustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” 

With that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. 

Shelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. 

Before driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys. Soon.” With that, they drove out of the driveway and we watched as their lights disappeared into the darkness of the road. 

Douglas and I turned, walking back to join Randy and my grandfather on the porch. As soon as we reached the top step, what we heard sent a lightning bolt down my spine.

I first saw the clock as a child in the hall at my grandfathers house. If I were pressed to explain why I even remember it, I would say it’s because it never seemed to keep actual time, or at least not any time we humans know. All of this was quite strange, but strangest of all was whenever it struck the twelve, without fail, someone in my family would die. First it was my aunt Judy. To this day I can vividly remember sitting at the table sorting my baseball cards after lunch one afternoon, and noticing the hand had finally struck twelve, before rapidly spinning back around to three. Around five minutes later, the home phone rang. It was the hospital—my aunt had been driving home from lunch when some maniac rammed into the side of her Jeep, killing her instantly. My grandfather fit the phone into the receiver with a sigh. “Well—I guess you’re old enough now” my grandfather murmured before sitting down across from me and explaining the clocks peculiar properties.According to him, his grandfather found it on the side of the road and picked it up, curious. Shortly after, however, he would come to fiercely regret it. He soon realized three things

1)The clock would count down to the death of a random person in the family it “belonged” to.
2)If the family is belonged to died out completely, it would “belong” to the family of whosoever touched it next. 
3)If you attempted to dispose of the clock, it would simply reappear back in ones home.

Of course, being young and naïve, I didn’t believe him, holding in my mind that it was just a coincidence. But I was forced to accept reality five years later when the hand hit twelve again, this time killing my cousin via complications in his heart surgery. Without fail, year after year, the clock would reach twelve and someone would die. Eventually, death claimed my grandfather, and his will named me the sole inheritor of everything—including the clock. Honestly I wanted nothing to do with the thing, but no matter what I tried, the clock would simply reappear in my room. I could, of course, ignore it if not for one little thing.....the ticking. The incessant reminder of all I’ve lost with every tock, tick, tock. Just ticking and ticking and ticking and ticking, leading to the eventual toll, it’s baritone chime driving me to madness. Day in and day out, almost as if taunting me, that scratchy metronome tick would pulse, getting louder and louder as it got closer to the bold XII superimposed in its face like an executioners hood. This THING has taken everything and everyone I ever cared for. Even when I met the love of my life, the moment we got married the clock decreed her impending doom, stealing happiness from my reach yet again. Only now, I have no more family left. It’s standing there mocking me still with that infuriating tick. It’s 11:58

My grandfather fit the phone into the receiver with a sigh. “Well—I guess you’re old enough now” my grandfather murmured before sitting down across from me and explaining the clocks peculiar properties.According to him, his grandfather found it on the side of the road and picked it up, curious. Shortly after, however, he would come to fiercely regret it. He soon realized three things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)The clock would count down to the death of a random person in the family it “belonged” to.
2)If the family is belonged to died out completely, it would “belong” to the family of whosoever touched it next. 
3)If you attempted to dispose of the clock, it would simply reappear back in ones home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being young and naïve, I didn’t believe him, holding in my mind that it was just a coincidence. But I was forced to accept reality five years later when the hand hit twelve again, this time killing my cousin via complications in his heart surgery. Without fail, year after year, the clock would reach twelve and someone would die. Eventually, death claimed my grandfather, and his will named me the sole inheritor of everything—including the clock. Honestly I wanted nothing to do with the thing, but no matter what I tried, the clock would simply reappear in my room. I could, of course, ignore it if not for one little thing.....the ticking. The incessant reminder of all I’ve lost with every tock, tick, tock. Just ticking and ticking and ticking and ticking, leading to the eventual toll, it’s baritone chime driving me to madness. Day in and day out, almost as if taunting me, that scratchy metronome tick would pulse, getting louder and louder as it got closer to the bold XII superimposed in its face like an executioners hood. This THING has taken everything and everyone I ever cared for. Even when I met the love of my life, the moment we got married the clock decreed her impending doom, stealing happiness from my reach yet again. Only now, I have no more family left. It’s standing there mocking me still with that infuriating tick. It’s 11:58&lt;/p&gt;

When you’re in college, you’re at the mercy of the administration’s whims and you live with what you’re given. You deal with the leaking flush in your bathroom’s toilet. You learn to sleep through your roommate inexplicably turning the lights on from 2–4 AM. However, I am now 34, and paying top dollar. When I say I need a hotel room that provides sunlight at certain hours, or a tranquil location to set up shop in, I mean it.

By now, I’d had it. Something needed to be done. Which is why, on my business trip to Rex City last week, room 666 at the Aloft Grand was my hotel of preference. The business? Ghostbusting. I researched Rex City’s resident spook and decided to merge my annual getaway with my determination to put the town folk at ease.

I expressed this preference to the hotel manager. And what do you think he said? “Sir, I see you are requesting room 666. I am happy to explain in detail the myriad ‘occurrences’ in that room. But let me just say it would be in both our best interests that we put you up elsewhere.”

This time, I wasn’t having it. “I truly appreciate your concern, my good man. I am aware of the ‘occurrences’ you speak of. Regardless, I insist on having that room.”

“Sir, I understand that room provides a lovely view of the ocean. We have other rooms overlooking the beach as well.”

“Let me be even clearer. The only reason I am even in this hotel is to stay in that room.”, I said.

“Pardon me, sir? Are you of sound mind?”

I chuckled at his bold question. “Well, let me try to put you at ease. I am a citizen who wants to give back to the community. It will not do for the town folk to be running scared of a resident spook, and I presume it’s certainly not good for the hotel’s business.

“Sir, I’m not sure where you’re...”

“Let me help you turn things around.”, I interjected.

He sounded resigned with his response. “Very well sir. Forgive me for being so morbid, but let me remind you that you agreed to certain terms when booking this hotel, and among those is a complete waiving of liability on this hotel should any injury or death occur in this particular room. I can refund the booking amount in full if you wish to reconsider.”

“I am aware, and I have no issues. Please give me the key and show me the way”.

He handed me the key, showed me the elevator, made the sign of the cross and said a little prayer. Nice gesture, even if unnecessary.

At this point, I did still expect something to happen — the elevator to auto-skip the 6th floor and force me to use the stairs, the floor to have a foul smell, the door to reveal a room that hadn’t been cleaned in years.

What did happen? Nothing. The door was the same colour and type as the others on the floor. The room was perfectly normal — Bed, bathroom, television, room service menu and fully stocked minibar. The WiFi password was on a sticky note above the intercom phone, along with the necessary contact numbers. I ordered in dinner, cracked open a Corona, connected to Netflix and started to binge The Haunting of Hill House. Nothing like a bit of banter to start an encounter with spirits, I thought.

I ran through the entire show (10/10, I must say) and fell asleep at 11 PM. Surely now the ghouls would work their magic? Nope. A full night’s sleep, and nothing happened. What a bore. At least now I had good news to deliver! I took a shower, packed my things up, locked the room and started towards the elevator.

Except, I couldn’t just ignore what I saw and go to the elevator — every other room on the floor was wide open.

I stepped into room 665, curious. I found a middle-aged woman lying face down on her bed. She wasn’t breathing. I rushed to her intercom and dialed reception for help, but nobody picked up. How incompetent! 1/10 from me, the moment I had time to review. I called an ambulance and the police, and headed to check room 664. Much to my horror, another lifeless occupant! This time, a plump man around my age, on his back, eyes shut. 663, 662, 661 — this was the scene in every room on the floor.

I went down the elevator and ran to the reception, only to find the receptionist and hotel manager lying wide-eyed and lifeless on the common hall couches. I was numb and speechless as the cops and doctors arrived.

**Confiscated from Cairo police department on 3/8/2020**

**Journal entries from Canadian-American researcher Steven K. Simms**

**Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt**

**Case status: OPEN**

\-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM

I’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.

5:46 PM

After  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.

7:45 PM

The  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.

8:34 PM

The  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.

8:57 PM

All festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.

9:42 PM

Success!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.

**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.**

9:49 PM

I’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?

10:12 PM

OK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?

10:21 PM

Walked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.

10:24 PM

Incident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.

10:27 PM

I  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.

11:14 PM

I  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.

11:16 PM

Incident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.

11:20 PM

I  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.

11:29 PM

I’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.

11:36 PM

A  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.

11:45 PM

I’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.

**--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--**

11:52 PM

I’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.

11:54 PM

Incident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.

11:59 PM

Success!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but

3/8/2020 12:01 AM

Incident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.

12:09 AM

Previous  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?

**--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—**

12:29 AM

In  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.

12:38 AM

Incident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.

12:42 AM

Corridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?

12:54 AM

Incident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.

1:01 AM

The  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.

1:08 AM

The screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.

1:12 AM

I’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.

1:15 AM

The  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.

1:18 AM

No  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.

**--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—**

1:24 PM

It  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.

1:27 AM

The black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.

**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—**

The  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…

He’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.

**--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—**

Darkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.

Why?  Just end this.

**--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—**

Somewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.

Pain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.

Maddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.

Chanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.

Would  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.

Cold.  Egypt can’t be cold.

Laying in blood.  No recourse.

Dragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.  Tight grip.

I’m the star!  I’m the star of the show!  They love me here!  They all came out to see me.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal entries from Canadian-American researcher Steven K. Simms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case status: OPEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:46 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:34 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:57 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:42 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:49 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:12 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:21 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:27 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:14 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:16 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:20 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:29 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:36 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:52 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:54 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:59 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/8/2020 12:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:09 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:29 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:38 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:42 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:54 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:08 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:12 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:18 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:27 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?  Just end this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold.  Egypt can’t be cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laying in blood.  No recourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.  Tight grip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the star!  I’m the star of the show!  They love me here!  They all came out to see me.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"The bugs that came from the wall. [Part I]

It was only 9:00 am when it started spreading.

There had been subtle vibrations from the ground for the past few weeks. I thought nothing of it until it crept up to the walls. My friend Kathrine was over and she had just stolen my phone and ran off. I pinned her to the wall playfully, laughing and trying to retrieve my phone when her smile faded into concern. “Everything alright?” I asked her. We stood silently for a moment, Katherine still against the wall. “Come feel this.” She said moving out of the way. I put my hand against the wall but lept back when I felt the throbbing. I stood for a moment pondering where I had felt this before. Katherine spoke up “I think...I think it’s in the floor too.” I looked at her surprisingly as I thought I had imagined the floor vibrating. I gave a nervous laugh “It’s probably the vents or something!” We stood still again not knowing what to do or say. 

A few hours after Katherine had left I started getting curious about the vibrations again. I was at my kitchen bar which was connected to the wall so I just leaned my head over about 2 inches away from the wall, to see if I could hear anything first. The vents weren’t on, which made sense because it was a fine spring day. I then very slowly placed my hand on the wall. The vibrations were there again, but...why couldn’t I hear them before? I decided to place my ear ON the wall this time.

 I wasn’t nervous at this point because there could be a very rational explanation for why a house full of machinery and electricity was vibrating through the walls. I wasn’t nervous that is, until I heard the heartbeat.

It was very distinct. The bump bump...bump bump. It startled me to hear this coming from my wall. I jumped back, knocking my milk over and almost my stool. At first I thought I might’ve just imagined it but when I leaned in to listen again it was the same as before bump bump...bump bump. Confused and a little frightened I went to grab a towel for the milk. After I cleaned and gathered my thoughts I came up with an explanation that there was an animal living in my wall. I mean... the vibrations could just mean the animal was moving and since me and Katherine both felt it, there were probably just a few creatures scurrying about. 

I talked to Katherine and she recommended calling an exterminator the next day but I had plans the entire afternoon. But...it was fine right? Boy was I wrong. The one day that I was out was the one day that I shouldn’t have been. 

By the time I got home from my long day of shopping and visiting my parents it was 10:40. I did my usual, putting groceries away, taking a shower and eating but then I noticed that something didn’t feel right. As I was sitting in bed on my phone I couldn’t help but feel that I was being stalked. Not just watched but like intense staring wherever I was. I went to the bathroom then walked back but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I texted my mom but she had apparently already gone to bed, so I instead texted Katherine. She told me that she had been in a situation like this before and all she had to do was get on a call with someone so that if there was actually someone there they wouldn’t try anything, and it worked. 

I decided to just FaceTime Katherine because we were already talking and she was a night owl like me. We talked for a few minutes just about past funny moments to make me feel better and then I realized what was wrong, well might be wrong. I hadn’t felt the vibrations when I got home. Maybe the animals had left? “Wait Katherine I think the animals are gone because-“ I looked back at the screen but Katherine’s face had gone pale. “What’s...wrong?” I asked forgetting about my situation for a second. “Don’t freak out...but there’s goo coming out of the wall.” I turned around expecting nothing but instead saw a trail of cloudy yellowish goo coming from a tiny hole in the wall. I scooted forward disgusted by the sight. It dripped down pretty slowly like slime would. “I wonder...” I said out loud. I stepped off my bed and felt the vibrations stronger than I had ever felt them. I walked over to the wall and put my hand on it. It was even stronger here and this time it FELT like a heartbeat. I put my ear up to the wall but didn’t hear anything until I thought I heard a light scratching noise from my bed. I turned and that’s when the pounding started. Louder and louder it got. I could see the wall behind my bed moving. “What’s happening?!” I could hear Katherine yell through the phone. 

It all happened at once. The wall pushed forward and a large crack formed. Then it happened again. Then on the 3rd time it broke open. Thank goodness I was on the other side of the room because a giant chunk of the wall came crashing onto my bed, crushing my phone under it.

Maybe the animals had left? “Wait Katherine I think the animals are gone because-“ I looked back at the screen but Katherine’s face had gone pale. “What’s...wrong?” I asked forgetting about my situation for a second. “Don’t freak out...but there’s goo coming out of the wall.” I turned around expecting nothing but instead saw a trail of cloudy yellowish goo coming from a tiny hole in the wall. I scooted forward disgusted by the sight. It dripped down pretty slowly like slime would. “I wonder...” I said out loud. I stepped off my bed and felt the vibrations stronger than I had ever felt them. I walked over to the wall and put my hand on it. It was even stronger here and this time it FELT like a heartbeat. I put my ear up to the wall but didn’t hear anything until I thought I heard a light scratching noise from my bed. I turned and that’s when the pounding started. Louder and louder it got. I could see the wall behind my bed moving. “What’s happening?!” I could hear Katherine yell through the phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all happened at once. The wall pushed forward and a large crack formed. Then it happened again. Then on the 3rd time it broke open. Thank goodness I was on the other side of the room because a giant chunk of the wall came crashing onto my bed, crushing my phone under it. I watched in pure horror as spiny, bony creatures came screeching out of the wall, covered in ooze, blood, and tiny bits of eggshell.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"My last girlfriend loved all the scary macabre things: ghosts, spirits, demons, etc. She would say that haunted places called out to her. I didn’t believe in the supernatural but sometimes our hobbies overlapped. I like to think of myself as a seasoned urban explorer and photographer. Urban exploration is delving into man-made structures or places have been deserted. Together we’d explore theme parks, catacombs, and hospitals. We’d talk for hours speculating why places were abandoned, and more personal things like why our families and friends abandoned us. We were seeing each other for a short time but when someone is your only source of human contact you get to know them quick.

Urban exploring is dangerous. At any moment a wall can collapse or the floor will give in. You could slip and cut yourself on something. You have to be prepared when you go out. The essentials include: flashlights, backpack, water, camera/gopro, first aid kit, pocket knife, gps, boots and gloves. Aside from the knife, the gloves are the most versatile and important item on the list. They’re for protection, grip, and obviously so cops won’t find out you’ve been trespassing. I ended up carrying most of the gear. Whenever I tried to get my girlfriend to carry her own weight, she’d remind me that she had a bad sense of direction or that she’s irresponsible and would lose something. She would laugh then regale me with urban legends from around the area. Woman in white, wendigos, hook killer, that sort of thing. I learned to stop asking for help. 

Aside from the danger, urban exploring brings me a sense of freedom. It’s not the same as hiking in nature because at its core, urban exploration has a human foundation. The corridors and rooms are man-made; reminiscent of any other architectural structure. You can feel others walking through the halls. But simultaneously these places are free of humans, free from their judgments, free from politics and mistakes. Most of all it’s quiet. I had completed a few excursions by myself until I met Jena at Bodie Ghost Town last spring. I had taken a tour when I saw her saunter down a trail in black apparel and parasol. Her skin was pale and I would have mistaken her for a ghost if she didn’t spend most of the time talking about them. The ghost town wasn’t what I usually liked to explore but I got to see saloons and other remnants of the gold rush. Since then, Jena started to tag along on my trips. Soon, she asked to be my girlfriend. Jena would fill me in on the spiritual side of the places we’d visit. Not my favorite thing to talk about but it was nice to have company for a while.

The last place we went together was the Blue Ghost Tunnel which is an abandoned railway tunnel in Ontario. The police warn the area is unsafe and not structurally sound. Over a 100 people have died in various accidents since its construction and is said to be the most haunted place in the Niagara Region. Some reports claim there are floating blue lights in the tunnel. Again, I don’t believe in the supernatural. The more my girlfriend talked about it, the less I believed. I believe in logic. There’s always a plausible explanation. Creaking noises and whistles can easily be explained by small animals or the wind. A weird light projecting itself somewhere is the reflection of light on a slick surface. Not ghosts. 

The toughest part of urban exploration is the beginning. If the police interfere, you explore the inside of a jail cell. You’ve got to remain sensitive to your surroundings when trespassing. We usually explored at night relying on our ears instead of our sight. My girlfriend was full of life and struggled to keep her voice down. I’d have to remind her several times that we could get caught before she would whisper. Even then, her whispers were almost non-stop. It was cute until we were caught entering an abandoned hospital in New Orleans. Her sounds spoiled my fun. 

To get to the Blue Ghost Tunnel, you’ve got to avoid cops and sneak across a disused water mill before going down a steep slope. We couldn’t use our flashlights. I stubbed my big toe on a rock and barely refrained from crying. No doubt Jena would have laughed out loud if she saw my pain. Luckily, she wasn’t paying attention and pointed at a floating white spectre. Someone had tied a towel around a tree branch to mark the correct direction of the west entrance. The east entrance, 713 feet away, is flooded. My girlfriend let out a little yelp nearly every step down the slope. She’d giggle and collect herself, “You know I have a bad sense of balance!”. I was preoccupied with cops haunting the area nearby. My head was going to deflate from all the shushing.

The entrance of the tunnel is bricked up like something out of the Cask of Amontillado with a gated doorway. The gate had been ripped open and parts of the wall were sledgehammered. Probably by other explorers. The cinder block barrier set my mind at ease. The sounds we’d make would stay contained inside instead of catapulting towards cops waiting for a mistake. The tunnel was cold and smelled like any other tunnel. The lingering scent of smoke, dust, and metallic wetness permeated the air. Soft sounds could be heard. Jena asked excitedly, “It’s ghosts right?”. “Probably water dripping further in”, I replied. The long corridor had it’s limestone walls tattooed in graffiti. The normal, “Jeff wuz here” and illegible balloon words were displayed. As we continued on, stereotypical “evil” imagery appeared. 

Jena pointed at an upside down star in a circle, “Do you know what that is?”

I shrugged, “A pentagon or something.”

“You are so stupid sometimes, it’s a pentagram!” Her laugh circled my head like a hungry mosquito. She said that the 666’s, pentagrams, and other signs were indicative of satanic rituals. I disagreed. They’re created by trolls to scare people away. And not the kind of troll that lives under a bridge. 

As you go deeper into the tunnel, the old railway ties appear and become a raised platform with water collecting on either side. They were like three foot wide and one foot deep gutters. As we were admiring the artwork, Jena asked for water. I kept one 40 oz. wide mouth water bottle for both of us during short trips like this. Jena was drinking water and studying the graffiti at the edge of the railway ties when she suddenly froze. The whites of her eyes doubled in size and she let go of the bottle. My reflexes were too slow to prevent it from crashing into the platform before falling into the stagnant tunnel water. The clang of the stainless steel danced through the corridor.

“Did you feel that?”

“Yes, I felt all that splash on me”

“No, something was breathing on my neck.”

“It was probably the wind” I muttered as I picked up the bottle and began shaking off the tunnel’s murky liquid.

“What wind? We’re in a tunnel.” She responded indignantly.

I rolled my eyes, “It was your imagination”

“No, I’m certain. We’ve found ghosts!” Her squeal of excitement reverberated through the tunnel and rang for far too long. When it finally stopped, I could still feel the vibrations punching my eardrums. She was too busy to notice that our bottle was now empty. 

Ghosts were real. There was no convincing her otherwise. We used to talk about other things. I would have loved to talk about architecture or design but it always came back to ghosts. Upset about our drinking water, I turned away to avoid an arguement. Whenever Jena got started on ghosts, she physically couldn’t talk about anything else. It’s as if levees had broken in her mouth resulting in a flood of useless knowledge. I continued down the tunnel passing underneath rotting support beams. She followed giddy with excitement. As we kept moving, the water on the ground became icy. Gradually, the water dripping down the walls turned to ice and began to mask the uninspired graffiti.  We had to slow our pace and take intentional steps. The rubber soles on our boots wouldn’t save us if we slid into the limestone. We could only go so far before the platform was completely buried in freezing water. She craned her neck and screamed, “Drastic changes in temperature means a spirit is nearby! Do you see or hear anything?” I didn’t think it was drastic. It was winter and we were moving further underground. It made sense to me. I heard nothing aside from the dropping of water and occasional loose rock. She didn’t have to raise her voice. I was beside her. I continued to shine my light into the abyss.

“I THINK I SEE A BLUE LIGHT!”

My head was ringing.

“THERE DO YOU SEE IT?!”

That’s when I saw it.

I grabbed my girlfriend’s arms, forcefully turning her body towards me, and wailed, “IT’S COMING FOR US. RUN!”

I took off, ice crunching beneath my boots. I was faster than her. More coordinated. I easily got back to stable land before she did. I stopped, looked back at her, pointed my finger and with all my breath yelled, “IT’S RIGHT BEHIND YOU!”

Midstride, Jena turned over her left shoulder to see. Her running footsteps on cracking ice stopped as she shrieked. My ears were filled with a familiar sound. Neither of her feet were on the ground anymore. Her body was slightly mid-air, twisting to find balance. I could make out her face as she rotated. It was real fear. Not the same face when she felt a “breath” on her neck. It was fear that could only come from the realization that she was falling. She did not see a blue light behind her. Nothing was behind her. Her arms flailed and failed to catch anything. Gravity brought her back to the earth. The back of her head collided with the edge of a railway tie.

I walked over calmly and shined my flashlight on her. Her arms were splayed out and twisted like a thrown action figure. She was unconscious, her head was bleeding, but I could tell she was breathing. A light mist emanated from her nose. Dots of red sputtered out. I said her name. No response. I called again. Nothing. I used my right boot to push her off the platform. The splash calmed and covered most of her like a blanket. Her face lay submerged under opaque gray and green film. I watched as pockets of oxygen escaped to the surface until there was no more.  

I didn’t shout at her because I saw a ghost. I saw the opportunity to go back to the silence. Go back to exploring alone; free from her noise and judgement. I don’t believe in ghosts. I don’t believe in the supernatural. I believe urban exploring is dangerous.  ",t2_9ixdn,False,,0,False,Urban exploring is dangerous,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fh4lfo,False,dark,,public,22,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,22,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583990359.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My last girlfriend loved all the scary macabre things: ghosts, spirits, demons, etc. She would say that haunted places called out to her.

,nosleep,"Test subject 5441 was to be our first success. After five thousand four hundred and forty previous subjects, we finally achieved our goal. We cured the common cold. The strain we inoculated 5441 with was a specially engineered strain of the common cold dubbed “Brutus.” Doctor McNamara named it that due to how we developed the strain. It was meant to lie dormant in the walls of blood vessels until the patient contracted a common cold, at which point the Brutus Strain would awaken and turn on the cold, overriding the virus and turning it harmless and benign. The now harmless cold would be flushed out of the body through the body’s own natural functions. We infected the virus with our own virus. Every test subject before was a failure. But on every test subject we used a different “angle of attack.” On 5441, however, it was initially overwhelmingly successful.

We first inoculated 5441 with the Brutus strain and waited fourteen days for the strain to incubate and prime itself. After the waiting period, we injected 5441 with the common cold. It was a fast acting strain but not particularly vicious. 5441 displayed the symptoms of the cold for a short period of time, he sneezed once, but within two hours he looked and felt fine. A blood test confirmed the Brutus strain was active and the cold was being neutralized. An hour later, 5441 began sweating and urinating heavily. These were symptoms, we believed, of the cold being flushed from the body. Nevertheless, we kept 5441 in quarantine overnight. 

I don’t know how we were able to move straight into human testing. Perhaps it was simply because we were working with nothing more than the common cold. After all, it wasn’t like we were working with smallpox or West Nile. Perhaps it was because, despite sharing almost 99% of our genetic makeup, there was enough of a difference that testing on chimpanzees would not have given us accurate or reliable data. We should have taken that precaution nevertheless. 

The next morning we discovered irregularities in subject 5441’s sleep monitoring system. Throughout the night, 5441 displayed a high, irregular heartbeat and his sheets were soaked in sweat. Perhaps he had suffered from a nightmare. But upon interviewing him, he could not recall any nightmares. And he persisted sweating. Another blood test revealed the cold virus had indeed been neutralized and flushed from the body. Yet the Brutus strain was still active. This was entirely unexpected. We had designed Brutus to cling to the blood vessel walls and become dormant once it’s job was done, only to be reactivated once a different cold virus entered the body. We had also designed the virus to be harmless to humans, having no effect on the body or its systems. After the jubilation of what appeared to be a resounding success the previous day, this was an unexpected and disappointing setback. Yet we carried on with further testing, arrogant, certain that this setback could easily be rectified. Even when test subject 5441 began bleeding from his nose, we did not begin to grasp the gravity of our failure. 

The next day, test subject 5441’s health had deteriorated a staggering amount. He complained of an intense, aching pain in his stomach, joints, and muscles. His breathing had become rapid. His skin, still clammy with sweat, appeared bloated as if air had been pumped just beneath its surface. His blood vessels appeared strained and overinflated beneath his skin. The nose bleed had not yet ceased. When we tried to draw more blood and run more tests he refused and resisted to the verge of violence, lashing out at us. We had to call in security to restrain him. Once restrained, we discovered his eyes had become extremely bloodshot. This minor setback was becoming an abstract failure. 

We managed to draw more blood and other fluids for tests. The Brutus strain had gone from active to malevolent. Under the microscope, we could see the virus attacking and destroying white blood cells. What it did to red blood cells, however, was terrifying, but somehow also extraordinary. It would inject itself into the red blood cell, duplicate itself, and somehow rapidly accelerate the blood cells own growth and division. The incredibly high red blood cell count explained many of his symptoms such as the joint pain, strained blood vessels, and rapid breathing. But that was just the beginning. 

From the lab, we heard a scream from 5441’s quarantine cell. When we arrived we found 5441 sitting upright, unbuckling his leg restraints. A nurse was sitting in the corner crying and clutching her face. The nurse had just drawn more of his blood when 5441 had dislocated his own thumbs in order to slip out of the arm restraints, grab the syringe from the nurse, and jam it into her eye socket. She was now infected with the Brutus strain. 5441’s face had become almost purple in color, his veins and arteries strained and swollen beneath his skin. Blood flowed freely, not only from his nose, but now his eyes as well. His profuse sweating continued. His restraints undone, he lunged at us like an animal, knocking us to the ground. He leaped out the open door and sprinted down the hall. I slammed the emergency button on the wall and a siren blared, red lights flashing everywhere. In the lab there was a freezer which kept glass “pucks” with cultures of every strain we had yet worked with, including Brutus. They were flash frozen to nearly zero kelvin. If the pucks were taken out and broken, the viruses would sublime and turn gaseous, airborne. 5441 had entered a state of insanity and we had to stop him before he reached the lab. 

Security arrived to the cell. One stayed back to help us as the rest ran to the lab. Before we could stop him, he went to help the injured nurse. She was infected and he was not wearing a biohazard suit. He knelt down and removed her hands from her face, getting her blood on his own hands in the process. He removed the syringe from her ruined eye. But as he did so, she flinched involuntarily and the syringe slipped, fell, and landed in his thigh. The room froze. The guard slowly looked down to the syringe that had inserted itself into his thigh. He too, was now infected. He panicked. Crying and screaming of how he didn’t want to die, he ran to the door. We tried to block him but he was a bear of a man and knocked us over with ease. We couldn’t allow this crisis, or the virus to spread outside the facility. We had to stop the guard and subject 5441 at all costs. I instructed the other doctors to run to the control room, there they would have a birds eye view of every room in the facility through the security cameras. There they would also have the ability to initiate the code black protocol. 

The facility, run by an extremely wealthy pharmaceutical company, had four security protocols; code green for when intruders broke into the facility; code orange for fires and natural disasters; code red for when test subjects or facility personnel became violent; and code black for when biological or chemical hazards were “mishandled” and threatened the security of the facility or the greater world. A code green protocol dictated a response from armed security guards and a detailed search of the facility. Code orange protocols initiated firefighting or search and rescue responses. Code red dictated another armed response, and if necessary, quarantine, arrest, or termination of any violent personnel. Code black alerted a nearby military airbase, which would then respond by dropping incendiary ordinance onto the facility until nothing remained but blackened, smoldering craters. Bombing would commence regardless of any personnel remaining in the facility. The company, and the military, had to do anything to stop a virus from spreading to the outside world, even if it meant sacrificing a few dozen lives. The nurse, despite her crying, was handling the situation with remarkable levelheadedness. Subject 5441, however, had lost his sanity, and the guard had panicked like a child. A code black protocol was necessary. 

The other doctors ran to the control room. They knew what they had to do. I sprinted to the lab, hopeful I could help the guards stop 5441 from causing any more damage. When I arrived, I found one guard dead, his neck twisted and head facing a horribly wrong direction. I found another crouched on the ground clutching a shard of glass in his shoulder. The remaining two guards, uninjured, kept an uneasy distance from 5441. He was standing in front of the freezer. He was a horrific sight. His skin was beet red. Blood streamed from his eyes, nose, and ears. He was leaking blood from his pores. It appeared that capillaries had burst all over his body. His veins had become so engorged that his whole body appeared ropy and strained. In his hand, he held a puck labeled “Brutus.”

Trying desperately to calm my nerves, I spoke smoothly and soothingly. I tried to talk him down, tried to talk him into putting the puck back into the freezer. I took a step forward. Wrong move. In an instant, he dropped the puck and it shattered on the ground. The guards lunged and tackled him. Pinning him on his stomach, they cuffed him. He was screaming incoherently, foam and spittle flying from his mouth. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the virus culture fizzing on the ground. It was airborne. We are all infected. The guards tried hauling 5441 to his feet. As they did so, 5441 let out one last guttural scream. With a horrific sound like the slap of a wet towel, his body opened up. His abdomen, arms, and legs split open at unseen seems. His eyes burst like grapes. Blood flowed out of his ruined and shredded body like a satanic baptism. The floor became slick with the ungodly amount of blood from 5441. And that was it. Silence fell. We are all infected. 

In writing this I am violating every non-disclosure agreement I signed for the company. Not that I care anymore. Code black protocol was initiated four minutes ago. It would take another three minutes for the jets and bombers to arrive and deliver their payload of brimstone and hellfire. There will be no lawsuit or legal action taken against me once by body is atomized by the military. There will also be no bloated paycheck, no Nobel prize for me. Now I sit in the control room with my colleagues. I am resigned to the fate of fire that comes for me. I am just hopeful the bombing neutralizes every molecule of this place. The virus cannot escape. It’s ironic, the name McNamara gave to the virus. Brutus. He named it so because we designed it to turn on and destroy other virus strains of its kind. But it turned on us, it’s creators, instead. How ironic.  

Over the wails of the infected guard, I can hear the roar of jet engines in the distance. A squadron of fighter bombers, loaded with incendiary ordinance, is near. Soon fire will rain from them like the wrath of God. And with that, I hope, the threat of this virus will end. Et tu, Brute?",t2_12t5m0,False,,0,False,Brutus’ Strain,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fh1ews,False,dark,,public,42,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,42,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583978620.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test subject 5441 was to be our first success. After five thousand four hundred and forty previous subjects, we finally achieved our goal. We cured the common cold. The strain we inoculated 5441 with was a specially engineered strain of the common cold dubbed “Brutus.” Doctor McNamara named it that due to how we developed the strain. It was meant to lie dormant in the walls of blood vessels until the patient contracted a common cold, at which point the Brutus Strain would awaken and turn on the cold, overriding the virus and turning it harmless and benign. The now harmless cold would be flushed out of the body through the body’s own natural functions. We infected the virus with our own virus. Every test subject before was a failure. But on every test subject we used a different “angle of attack.” On 5441, however, it was initially overwhelmingly successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first inoculated 5441 with the Brutus strain and waited fourteen days for the strain to incubate and prime itself. After the waiting period, we injected 5441 with the common cold. It was a fast acting strain but not particularly vicious. 5441 displayed the symptoms of the cold for a short period of time, he sneezed once, but within two hours he looked and felt fine. A blood test confirmed the Brutus strain was active and the cold was being neutralized. An hour later, 5441 began sweating and urinating heavily. These were symptoms, we believed, of the cold being flushed from the body. Nevertheless, we kept 5441 in quarantine overnight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how we were able to move straight into human testing. Perhaps it was simply because we were working with nothing more than the common cold. After all, it wasn’t like we were working with smallpox or West Nile. Perhaps it was because, despite sharing almost 99% of our genetic makeup, there was enough of a difference that testing on chimpanzees would not have given us accurate or reliable data. We should have taken that precaution nevertheless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we discovered irregularities in subject 5441’s sleep monitoring system. Throughout the night, 5441 displayed a high, irregular heartbeat and his sheets were soaked in sweat. Perhaps he had suffered from a nightmare. But upon interviewing him, he could not recall any nightmares. And he persisted sweating. Another blood test revealed the cold virus had indeed been neutralized and flushed from the body. Yet the Brutus strain was still active. This was entirely unexpected. We had designed Brutus to cling to the blood vessel walls and become dormant once it’s job was done, only to be reactivated once a different cold virus entered the body. We had also designed the virus to be harmless to humans, having no effect on the body or its systems. After the jubilation of what appeared to be a resounding success the previous day, this was an unexpected and disappointing setback. Yet we carried on with further testing, arrogant, certain that this setback could easily be rectified. Even when test subject 5441 began bleeding from his nose, we did not begin to grasp the gravity of our failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, test subject 5441’s health had deteriorated a staggering amount. He complained of an intense, aching pain in his stomach, joints, and muscles. His breathing had become rapid. His skin, still clammy with sweat, appeared bloated as if air had been pumped just beneath its surface. His blood vessels appeared strained and overinflated beneath his skin. The nose bleed had not yet ceased. When we tried to draw more blood and run more tests he refused and resisted to the verge of violence, lashing out at us. We had to call in security to restrain him. Once restrained, we discovered his eyes had become extremely bloodshot. This minor setback was becoming an abstract failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to draw more blood and other fluids for tests. The Brutus strain had gone from active to malevolent. Under the microscope, we could see the virus attacking and destroying white blood cells. What it did to red blood cells, however, was terrifying, but somehow also extraordinary. It would inject itself into the red blood cell, duplicate itself, and somehow rapidly accelerate the blood cells own growth and division. The incredibly high red blood cell count explained many of his symptoms such as the joint pain, strained blood vessels, and rapid breathing. But that was just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the lab, we heard a scream from 5441’s quarantine cell. When we arrived we found 5441 sitting upright, unbuckling his leg restraints. A nurse was sitting in the corner crying and clutching her face. The nurse had just drawn more of his blood when 5441 had dislocated his own thumbs in order to slip out of the arm restraints, grab the syringe from the nurse, and jam it into her eye socket. She was now infected with the Brutus strain. 5441’s face had become almost purple in color, his veins and arteries strained and swollen beneath his skin. Blood flowed freely, not only from his nose, but now his eyes as well. His profuse sweating continued. His restraints undone, he lunged at us like an animal, knocking us to the ground. He leaped out the open door and sprinted down the hall. I slammed the emergency button on the wall and a siren blared, red lights flashing everywhere. In the lab there was a freezer which kept glass “pucks” with cultures of every strain we had yet worked with, including Brutus. They were flash frozen to nearly zero kelvin. If the pucks were taken out and broken, the viruses would sublime and turn gaseous, airborne. 5441 had entered a state of insanity and we had to stop him before he reached the lab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security arrived to the cell. One stayed back to help us as the rest ran to the lab. Before we could stop him, he went to help the injured nurse. She was infected and he was not wearing a biohazard suit. He knelt down and removed her hands from her face, getting her blood on his own hands in the process. He removed the syringe from her ruined eye. But as he did so, she flinched involuntarily and the syringe slipped, fell, and landed in his thigh. The room froze. The guard slowly looked down to the syringe that had inserted itself into his thigh. He too, was now infected. He panicked. Crying and screaming of how he didn’t want to die, he ran to the door. We tried to block him but he was a bear of a man and knocked us over with ease. We couldn’t allow this crisis, or the virus to spread outside the facility. We had to stop the guard and subject 5441 at all costs. I instructed the other doctors to run to the control room, there they would have a birds eye view of every room in the facility through the security cameras. There they would also have the ability to initiate the code black protocol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facility, run by an extremely wealthy pharmaceutical company, had four security protocols; code green for when intruders broke into the facility; code orange for fires and natural disasters; code red for when test subjects or facility personnel became violent; and code black for when biological or chemical hazards were “mishandled” and threatened the security of the facility or the greater world. A code green protocol dictated a response from armed security guards and a detailed search of the facility. Code orange protocols initiated firefighting or search and rescue responses. Code red dictated another armed response, and if necessary, quarantine, arrest, or termination of any violent personnel. Code black alerted a nearby military airbase, which would then respond by dropping incendiary ordinance onto the facility until nothing remained but blackened, smoldering craters. Bombing would commence regardless of any personnel remaining in the facility. The company, and the military, had to do anything to stop a virus from spreading to the outside world, even if it meant sacrificing a few dozen lives. The nurse, despite her crying, was handling the situation with remarkable levelheadedness. Subject 5441, however, had lost his sanity, and the guard had panicked like a child. A code black protocol was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other doctors ran to the control room. They knew what they had to do. I sprinted to the lab, hopeful I could help the guards stop 5441 from causing any more damage. When I arrived, I found one guard dead, his neck twisted and head facing a horribly wrong direction. I found another crouched on the ground clutching a shard of glass in his shoulder. The remaining two guards, uninjured, kept an uneasy distance from 5441. He was standing in front of the freezer. He was a horrific sight. His skin was beet red. Blood streamed from his eyes, nose, and ears. He was leaking blood from his pores. It appeared that capillaries had burst all over his body. His veins had become so engorged that his whole body appeared ropy and strained. In his hand, he held a puck labeled “Brutus.”&lt;/p&gt;

“You look like a wreck,” October said as I slid into the seat next to them. That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. 

October nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.

After class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”

“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.

—————————————————————————

I was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. 

“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. 

“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.

Leo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” 

I was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. 

“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.

“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. 

I pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!

“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.

I could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.

“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.

They were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.

—————————————————————————

I slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. 

The warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. 

Brandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. 

“Shani?” 

I choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.

This was not my girlfriend.

This was the monster that had taken her.

,nosleep,"When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people's houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.

The rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.

The rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.

There was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.

Me and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.

I figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.

My smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa's basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. *If I looked through them,* I thought, *what would I see?* Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.

The door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.

The floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.

I stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.

When I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.

From the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It's me! I can't believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn't think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. 'Antonio' took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”

I remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said 'Antonio', again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It's really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”

As I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I'm not going down there. Can't you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn't move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I'm going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn't follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.

And that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.

The rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn't my cousin.",t2_5wplc085,False,,0,False,The Extra Rooms,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fh7ijt,False,dark,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1584001820.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people&amp;#39;s houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa&amp;#39;s basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. &lt;em&gt;If I looked through them,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;what would I see?&lt;/em&gt; Alas, there was no way I could do so.

This thought was sunshine radiating in the dark and sad setting of Detroit at 1:53 in the morning. My flight was at 2:45 and so I woke up early and was confident that I’d make it on time. I pulled into the parking garage and found a spot not too clogged with the amount of cars that would surprise anyone considering the time. With a turn of my key in the ignition, my car shut down with a tired gasp. 
I approached the doors of the airport surprised at the amount of inactivity in the drop-off zone. I tugged my red suitcase behind me as I glided towards the terminal. 

I took a curious glance around the ticket counter and was genuinely confused as to where everyone was. “Had something happened, was there some sort of evacuation that I hadn’t known about?” As I was contemplating these ideas and questions I heard a faint and steady clicking, it sounded as if someone with tap dancing shoes was walking. “Great! Someone that could help me,” I thought. But, as the clicking became slightly louder and faster I felt that the person these sounds belonged to was a devil in disguise. It was a feeling you can’t describe or explain. I believe it’s a part of your fight or flight intuition. In this situation, I decided to fly. 

I left my things next to a gray bench at the entrance and began walking away from the sound. At first, I passed the ticket booths but as the sound turned from a clicking into a stomping-run I ran towards the metal detectors. I ran straight through, caring more for myself than how much trouble I could get into. The sound seemed to be following me and yet, when I looked behind, there was no one. I slowed to a jog, but the running didn’t.
I went into a full sprint as I passed the restaurants in the airport plaza. This ‘thing’ seemed to slow after a few minutes thanks to my time as a track long-distance runner in high school. However, I wasn’t going to slow until I felt confident.  

As I rounded the corner I spyed a bathroom and made a dumb decision of hiding In there. I slid under the door of the stall and hopped onto the toilet. It was a solid 5 minutes before I heard the clicking again. It was as calm and quiet as I heard it when I entered the airport. 
“What had happened? Why is no one here? Is no one here because of this thing?” The clicking got louder and sounded closer and I soon realized that I should’ve left the airport when I was ahead. The clicking was coming closer and I wish that I took this flight sooner so I could’ve seen my family one last time. 

The clicking stopped. I looked at the bottom of the door and saw some black dress shoes. The man with the shoes tapped on my door 3 times and I asked in a scared and shaken tone, “what do you want?” It was then that the most violent shaking I’ve ever felt was centered on my stall. 2 bone-White wrinkly hands were on the stall door, and although those hands looked old they had the force and power to shake my whole stall. I lept off the toilet lid and ducked down into the stall next to me thinking that that would help me. My mind was racing so fast and I was thinking about so much that I didn’t realize that the shaking stopped. I looked under the stalls and behold, no shoes.

I exited the stall to a busy food court, a sprawling airport compared to the one I was met with minutes before.

,nosleep,"I love hugs. They are, without question, the best. To keep things clear, I mean real hugs, a full embrace without hesitation or restraint. There is something special about that kind of closeness, the warmth, and the feeling of trust that just can’t be beat.

I’ll give an example so you can really understand what I mean. Just tonight I had a hug that was truly glorious. It was nearly midnight, and I was dropping a date off at their house. The evening had been wonderful, a simple, chilled out hangout at the local coffee shop. Pleasant conversation, a few jokes, and just enough dabbling in the deeper topics to plant those seedling feelings of trust and companionship. The simple kind of date that seem to only happen in the movies. All to soon the evening was drawing to a close and even if this was only our first date, I could see she wasn’t quite ready for it end.

She hesitated, getting out of the car and then in a soft, shy voice asked if I would like to come inside. I smile warmly, no hints lustful intent, and agree. Once inside we continued our talking without missing a beat. Conversation flowing just as naturally as if we had known each other for years. Five minutes turned to thirty minutes and as the night wore on we crept closer and closer to each other. Slowly the talk faded and for a brief moment we considered each other in silence. Her eyes meet mine and I see my chance. I opened my arms wide and she fell into them, allowing me to wrap her up in a tight embrace.

I immediately felt the warm of her body pressed against mine. I squeezed her in tighter and she returned the favor. God, but isn’t that just the most wondrous thing to feel. The total commitment, the soft thump of her heart against my chest. It takes discipline to resist rushing the moment, to take it all in to fast. But wait I did, savoring the intimacy of that initial moment. Then I brought her in closer, feeling her begin to squirm in my arms. The frantic movement adding additional friction and life to the moment. Still I squeezed, slowly and surely, feeling the bones warp and crack. She begins to protest, but her voice is silenced as the air is pushed from her lungs. I cooed soothingly as I continued to constrict, her arms flailing, attempting to break my grip until at last there was a loud snap and she went entirely limp, her head falling to rest on my shoulder. I leaned my head against it. Enjoying the feeling of her hair upon my cheek. This sublime moment nearly brings me to tears. 

I continued to tighten the my embrace and at last the skin could no longer bear the pressure. It burst open, the hot red fountains washed over my entire form and at last the warm reached a crescendo. I gasped, relishing the heat as she bathed and soaks me. I don’t know how long this lasted before eventually the warmth faded, and her body finally went cold. Gently I rested her on the couch, patting her head before going to clean up, somber in the afterglow. I left in silence, reflecting on the whole affair, smiling at the simple joy.

,nosleep,"Hello all, again thank you for the concerns, I should have listened sooner, right now I am in the hospital, I'm missing some fingers and I don't think they are done with me yet. My last shift is tomorrow and I will try to update when I can, let me tell you what happened on my third shift so far. 


I left my house after the call from the mysterious woman, I knew I had messed up, who could follow all those rules while being scared half to death. I raced down to the cemetery, already I could feel my stomach in my throat. The sky was dark for being this early, windy and cold; a storm was on the horizon. It was one of those days where the quiet thunder rolls in from the hills and crashes lightning in bright streaks across the sky. The cemetery gate was off its hinges, swaying back and forth from the strong winds, it clanked loudly against the iron; echoing through the field. I powered through, my leg throbbing with each slight movement. Down the narrow path, I hardly noticed the cemetery was empty, not a single grave was in the lot. Just a lot of dried dead grass. Of all the crazy shit I've seen in the past few days, this was the least of my concerns. 


When I reached the hut, the classic Cadillac with dark windows was parked out front. The woman with red hair and milky white skin sat on the hood smoking a cigarette. Her dark glasses reflecting the glow of her cigarette. The thunder began roaring in sync. I pulled up alongside her, grabbed my bag, which had an empty water bottle in it this time. She met me halfway, flicking her cigarette into the grass. I approached her tentatively while the butt of her cigarette with a bright red ember singed the dried grass at my feet.


*""Do you know why I’m upset with you?""* she asked adjusting her sunglasses, her hips swaying about.


*""Well I guess it had to do with me not following the rules""*  a streak of silent lightning etched across the night sky. 


*""Correct Henry, and with disobedience, comes repercussions""* she snapped back.


I could feel the lump in my throat again *""Well…well you never told me about all that crazy shit that was going on here I…""*


*""You have been paid handsomely Henry! You did not follow the rules and now payments must be returned my dear""* her voice becoming more demanding.


*""Ok fine take back some of my payments, but you have some explaining to do""* I nervously replied.


*""Not at this time Henry, do you hear that""*. On cue the thunder erupted. I winced as the deafening thunder bellowed. 


*""That’s for you Henry, you've made it this far with your life, Robert can’t say the least""* she said with a crooked smile while my nervous smile reflected in her glasses. She approached me slowly, grabbing something from her behind her back. 


I cautiously stepped backwards *""Hey, hey stay away from me lady""* treading backwards, I tripped over something hard. A gravestone popped up from behind me and I hit the dirt, my knee rang out in pain. The wind howled sending branches flying, the woman straddled me in a flash, her knee digging into my knee which was now bleeding again. Her wild red hair flailing in the wind. She revealed a steel blade from behind her back with an ornate red crystal handle, the blade reflecting the moonlight. Her wicked grin grew wider as she squeezed my wrist. I writhed and wriggled to get free where she would then dig her knee deeper into my wound sending red hot pain surging through my body. Squeezing my hand, she put the blade to my fingers. 


*""A payment Henry, don’t you think?""*  I cried out and grimaced with fear. With a flew clean slices, feeling wet hot, she sliced through three of my fingers, leaving my index finger and thumb, they dropped to the ground curled up and bloodied. I let out a sickening wet screech followed by a boom of thunder and lightning. Get up she said, licking the blood from the blade, your shift starts now. 


I stood up, dizzy and faint and wrapped my hand tight within my shirt, I was losing blood quick. The woman disappeared into her Cadillac and took off, a silent thunderbolt lit up the dark field, instantly I was surrounded by gravestones. I made my way into the hut, answered the HAM radio, it was the woman, all she told me was to use the first aid kit under the desk and that if I left, I would be killed before I could reach the gate. I poured alcohol over my cuts, and wrapped it tight, my hand felt lighter. 


I wanted to leave in that moment, knowing whatever death I may face, whatever Robert faced before he left us had to be something sinister. The rain never came, just low thundering and bright streaks of lightning. With each bolt of lightning, the cemetery lit up, once there would be dozens of gravestones, next there would be two, then none and so on and so forth. I snapped back when I realized there was a rule about this, the thunder was getting louder with each passing lighting strike, it was close. I rummaged for the list and read through them again. *""Rule 4: If grave stones begin to appear and disappear, go outside and pour oil over them, oil located under the desk""*


There it was, pour oil over gravestones if they begin to appear and disappear. I looked under the desk and behind the first aid kit was a rusty old can, filled to the brim with viscous black oil. I grabbed the tin with my good hand, the lightning crashed again as a single large tombstone appeared near inches from the glass of the hut. Nearly falling over, I let out a little whelp by its sight. I nervously walked out into the darkness, the cool winds blowing into my face. The gravestone must have been 8 feet tall. I was shocked by the warmth that was radiating from it. I shakily tipped the oil can over the gravestone, not knowing what to expect. The oil bubbled and oozed where it began to melt away the rock like acid. Soon the gravestone was a melted pile on the ground, a lightning bolt crashed quietly, illuminating the field revealing the normal looking cemetery. I raced back inside, not wanting to stay out past 10 minutes and waited. With each bolt of lightning, the field lit up and revealed the same number of gravestones, I counted carefully each time. 


As the night went on, boredom began to seep in and the pain in me was now a dull throbbing ache. My lips were dry and cracked and my head felt like needles were being jammed into it. While I rested in pain trying to resist the urge to puke, a single lowly bee landed on the glass in front of me. I didn't recall ever seeing a bug out here. Puzzled, I stared at him as he roamed about the glass. 


Then another, one by one, bees landed on the glass. Hundreds upon hundreds enclosed the glass, darkening the inside of the hut, their vibrations growing louder. I read over the rules again, *""Rule 2: If bugs start landing on the huts glass window, burn the candles that are under the desk till your shift ends""*


Before I could burn the first candle I had, a bee made its way through the crack in the glass where my phone used to be lodged in. It buzzed around the room, bumping into the light fixture. I hadn't known what to do at this point, grasping the candle in my good hand. More bees poured in, the buzzing grew louder. I dove back towards the door, covering myself in my hoodie while the bees flooded in, now they were landing on me. I frantically tried to light the match with my hand but with each swipe, I would drop the match book. I swatted them away desperately, each sting feeling like a hypodermic needle in my skin. Every inch of loose skin was getting stung, one lucky one stung my left eye as I reached for the dropped matchbook. I shrieked at the white-hot pain searing and yanked the stinger from my eye, I couldn't see. 


With the matchbook in my mouth, I struck the match and heard it catch. I held the match to the candle as bees crawled all over me, waiting for the wick to catch. I covered my eyes with my hand, squinting to see if the candle took. When I saw the little orange flame light up, I opened the hut door and fell out into the cemetery, slamming it behind me. I waited by the door as the bees swarmed inside. My watch counting down the minutes, no longer than 10 minutes out here. 


My legs were starting to get shaky as the minutes winded down, I could see yellow light faintly out in the distance with each lighting strike, the being was waiting. Sweat rolled down my brow as my final minute came, then, back into the bee swarm. Not wanting to face the being which I think killed Robert, I reached for the door, closed my eyes and slowly walked in. The buzzing was deafening, I stood in the middle of the hut as the bees crawled over me, an occasional sting here or there. I waited what felt like a century till I noticed the buzzing was getting quieter. Soon I gathered enough courage to open my eyes, there were hardly any bees left in the hut. I stood still again, and waited a few more minutes till all I heard was quietness, raindrops began pelting the glass. The bees were gone. I sat on the floor sobbing, my body was aching with stings, throbbing all over. I look at my hand where my fingers were, feeling like I could still flex them and noticed a bee was crawling into my open wound. 


I frantically reached to grab it, wailing as it dug in my skin. I couldn't get a hold of it as it disappeared within me. I sat there wide eyed, sickened. My finger was dripping a stream of blood onto the floor while my jaw gaped open, tears racing down my face. I know what I saw, a bee was inside me, I could feel it slightly moving within me. I curled up on the floor and cried. The candle burning bright next to me. I don't know when but I must have passed out after that. Either blood loss or shock from the stings, I went out cold. I awoke to a bright sky, the sun blaring through the glass. The candle was nothing more than a burnt wick, my heart sank when I realized it may not have stayed lit for my whole shift.


My head was spinning, my knee and hand covered in dried blood. My eye felt like I had baseball sized welt on it, I could barely see out of it. I stood up hazily and looked around, the cemetery was empty again. Waiting outside for me was the woman with red hair, she sauntered over and unlocked the door. She looked at my hand, winced as a bee bumbled past her and motioned for me to get out. I sobbed as I walked towards my car, I could feel her presence watching me or somethings presence watching me. I drove myself to the hospital after that, I told them about the bee but they didn't believe me. They asked what happened to my fingers; I made up some story of my fingers getting caught in a weightlifting machine that sliced them right off. They looked at me cautiously. Their caution turned to confusion when I also confessed that I got stung by a swarm of bees as I left the gym to rush to the hospital. 


While I sit here in the hospital bed, I know they are watching me, I can feel their presence around me, when I'm walking about. The wounds where my fingers were ballooned to a massive size, I could occasionally feel a tickle or a vibration somewhere in my body, I wonder if my buddy was making a hive somewhere inside me. My finger wounds oozed a gluey white and green puss that the nurse changed hourly. It smelt horribly and my skin was turning green. As I rested in bed, I got an email on my laptop it was from the woman. All it read was ""Tomorrow shift, your last one, be there or you will have another payment to owe"" I half smiled and half sighed, I can’t believe this is happening to me, I feel like I am losing my damn mind. I will keep you guys posted after my last shift tomorrow if I make it out alright, thank you guys for the support.

,nosleep,"

Growing up I was always the “cool kid” in my class. I had a pretty large group of friends and of course, we used to get in all sorts of trouble. One time me and my best friend Charlie got sent to the principal’s office for replacing everyone’s text books with play boy magazines during assembly. Another time we got caught filling up the janitors gas tank which he used for his lawnmower with orange juice. Some pranks where harmless while others weren’t. I remember one time me and a small group of friends including Charlie snuck into the principals office and downloaded a virus to his computer. His fault really for not having a password on it. I can’t really remember what the virus was, but it was one you got off of a porn site. cut us some slack, we were young and immature. In the end we where all caught, but for some reason only me and Charlie got into any serious trouble. Probably because we were infamous for being bad kids. 

In the end we got ourselves after school detention in mrs Johnson’s class. Mrs Johnson was one of the most strictest teachers I ever had the privilege of meeting. She taught in the maths department and EVERYONE hated her. She was well known for giving out tons of homework and detentions if you even stepped a little bit out of line. I never really payed attention In her class. She would just talk on and on about Algebra and calculus and boring stuff like that. A lot of pupils despised her and I could see why. She would constantly yell at kids and sometimes even make the girls cry which really pissed me off. No matter how much of a brat I was i would never hit a girl or really even bother one. There was a really cute girl in my class who I constantly teased and taunted, but all in a flirty way. And you know what? She flirted back as well. But anyway, me and mrs Johnson never really bother each other. 

I would stay out her way and she’d stay out mine. But Charlie on the other hand, she hated Charlie with a passion. She would constantly call on him in class and treat him like crap. While walking to detention Charlie said “hey man, why don’t we just skip detention? She won’t really care. I doubt she wants to stay after hours to look after us two anyway.” This was a stupid idea, which is why I responded with “No way man, I’m not risking getting suspended again. My parents already went berserk when I told them I had a detention, how do ya think they’d fell if I got suspended for the 4th time?”
“Good point” said Charlie as we reached Mrs Johnson’s. I pushed the door open to see... no one, the class was empty. I was kinda confused about this as the principal said he told Mrs Johnson that she was taking our detention. “Good,she’s not here. let’s go” said Charlie “wait a minute” I responded with. “We can’t just leave, let’s sit down for five minutes and If she doesn’t turn up then we can leave.” 
“Ugh.. FINE” replied Charlie as we took our seats. 

The clock ticked 4:20, then 4:25, then 4:30 and so on until Charlie finally said “DUDE, she’s forgotten about us, let’s just leave and tomorrow we’ll tell the principal she didn’t show up.”
“Ok, fine. But we have to prove that WE actually showed up. Let’s take a photo of us sitting here in this empty class room and show that to the principal.” I said. “Ok, that’s a pretty good idea.” I took out my phone to take the picture but I then realised it was dead. “Damn it, my phones out, what about yours?” I said while looking at Charlie. “Crap, mines is out too, I could’ve sworn it was at 82% earlier.” This annoyed me, cause now when we tell the principal he probably wouldn’t believe that we showed up. “Well what the hell are we supposed to do?” I asked Charlie frustrated. “I dunno, let’s just leave and we’ll worry about it tomorrow.” Yeah, great plan. Worry about it tomorrow. 

As we were getting up from our seats we could hear the sound of footsteps echoing down the hall. “Hey, maybe that’s her” I said to Charlie.
“Yeah, I hope it is, cause now she can’t get mad when I’m late to class. she’s almost fifteen minutes late.” All of a sudden the footsteps stopped... And started going in the other direction from where they came from. “What the hell is she doing?” Asked Charlie.
“I dunno, maybe it’s not her and some one else.” I replied
“We’ll go and check”. We slowly stood up and made our way to the door. When we reached it we quickly peeked our heads around the corner and saw nothing but an empty hallway. “Who the hell was that?” I asked as we slowly emerged from the classroom. “How am I supposed to know?” Replied Charlie as we started to walk towards the exit. “Probably the cleaner or something” I said as we got near the exit. We pushed on the handle and... nothing, the door wouldn’t budge “what the hell why isn’t it opening?” I asked.

“It must be locked c’mon and we’ll try the main entrance.” Said Charlie. As we walked to the main entrance we passed the girls bathroom. “Hey man, you wanna take a peek inside?” Said Charlie. “Hell no” I responded.

“Come on man, no ones around to stop us, plus the teacher might be taking a dump in there.” I laughed and said
“Ok fine, but not too long. I wanna go home.” We pushed open the door and looked around. Turns out it looked way different than the boys, the mirrors where clean, the sinks weren’t flooded and not a bit of graffiti in sight. “I could get used to this place” said Charlie as he entered one of the stalls. “Hey man, don’t be a perv” I said jokingly.
“Calm down, I’m only look-“ he stopped all of a sudden. I was confused so I walked over to where he was standing and almost screamed. Lying in the cubical face up... was Mrs Johnson. “HOLY SHIT DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED” I yelled. Charlie said nothing and just stood there shocked. She had stab wounds all over her body and there was blood all over the cubical. She was dead for sure.”who-who would’ve done this” Said Charlie weakly. That’s when we heard the footsteps approach the bathroom. And the door slowly squeaked open.",t2_4k7sc0kn,False,,0,False,After school detention,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fh3soo,False,dark,,public,17,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,17,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583987496.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up I was always the “cool kid” in my class. I had a pretty large group of friends and of course, we used to get in all sorts of trouble. One time me and my best friend Charlie got sent to the principal’s office for replacing everyone’s text books with play boy magazines during assembly. Another time we got caught filling up the janitors gas tank which he used for his lawnmower with orange juice. Some pranks where harmless while others weren’t. I remember one time me and a small group of friends including Charlie snuck into the principals office and downloaded a virus to his computer. His fault really for not having a password on it. I can’t really remember what the virus was, but it was one you got off of a porn site. cut us some slack, we were young and immature. In the end we where all caught, but for some reason only me and Charlie got into any serious trouble. Probably because we were infamous for being bad kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end we got ourselves after school detention in mrs Johnson’s class. Mrs Johnson was one of the most strictest teachers I ever had the privilege of meeting. She taught in the maths department and EVERYONE hated her. She was well known for giving out tons of homework and detentions if you even stepped a little bit out of line. I never really payed attention In her class. She would just talk on and on about Algebra and calculus and boring stuff like that. A lot of pupils despised her and I could see why. She would constantly yell at kids and sometimes even make the girls cry which really pissed me off. No matter how much of a brat I was i would never hit a girl or really even bother one. There was a really cute girl in my class who I constantly teased and taunted, but all in a flirty way. And you know what? She flirted back as well. But anyway, me and mrs Johnson never really bother each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would stay out her way and she’d stay out mine. But Charlie on the other hand, she hated Charlie with a passion. She would constantly call on him in class and treat him like crap. While walking to detention Charlie said “hey man, why don’t we just skip detention? She won’t really care. I doubt she wants to stay after hours to look after us two anyway.” This was a stupid idea, which is why I responded with “No way man, I’m not risking getting suspended again. My parents already went berserk when I told them I had a detention, how do ya think they’d fell if I got suspended for the 4th time?”
“Good point” said Charlie as we reached Mrs Johnson’s. I pushed the door open to see... no one, the class was empty. I was kinda confused about this as the principal said he told Mrs Johnson that she was taking our detention. “Good,she’s not here. let’s go” said Charlie “wait a minute” I responded with. “We can’t just leave, let’s sit down for five minutes and If she doesn’t turn up then we can leave.” 
“Ugh.. FINE” replied Charlie as we took our seats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clock ticked 4:20, then 4:25, then 4:30 and so on until Charlie finally said “DUDE, she’s forgotten about us, let’s just leave and tomorrow we’ll tell the principal she didn’t show up.”
“Ok, fine. But we have to prove that WE actually showed up. Let’s take a photo of us sitting here in this empty class room and show that to the principal.” I said. “Ok, that’s a pretty good idea.” I took out my phone to take the picture but I then realised it was dead. “Damn it, my phones out, what about yours?” I said while looking at Charlie. “Crap, mines is out too, I could’ve sworn it was at 82% earlier.” This annoyed me, cause now when we tell the principal he probably wouldn’t believe that we showed up. “Well what the hell are we supposed to do?” I asked Charlie frustrated. “I dunno, let’s just leave and we’ll worry about it tomorrow.” Yeah, great plan. Worry about it tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were getting up from our seats we could hear the sound of footsteps echoing down the hall. “Hey, maybe that’s her” I said to Charlie.
“Yeah, I hope it is, cause now she can’t get mad when I’m late to class. she’s almost fifteen minutes late.” All of a sudden the footsteps stopped... And started going in the other direction from where they came from. “What the hell is she doing?” Asked Charlie.
“I dunno, maybe it’s not her and some one else.” I replied
“We’ll go and check”. We slowly stood up and made our way to the door. When we reached it we quickly peeked our heads around the corner and saw nothing but an empty hallway. “Who the hell was that?” I asked as we slowly emerged from the classroom. “How am I supposed to know?” Replied Charlie as we started to walk towards the exit. “Probably the cleaner or something” I said as we got near the exit. We pushed on the handle and... nothing, the door wouldn’t budge “what the hell why isn’t it opening?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I have never met anybody from out of town. I’ve never spoken to anybody who has. It’s a very small town, and I know that some of you from your big cities full of rain-slicked sidewalks and fragrant coffee shops are going to laugh at some of my mistakes. It easy to get confused hearing about things that you’ve never actually touched. I’ve heard about all these things like wind, cattle, and city limits, and I just applied them to our little town. I assumed (I believe incorrectly) that all towns had, for example, city limits just like ours. Any town I hear about has city limits, so I assumed (please don’t laugh here) that there were just like the city limits I’ve felt so many times: those high metal walls, cold to the touch, gently groaning, embedded with pressure doors and keypads. 

Now you might be thinking, well, hell, why didn’t this silly goose ever notice a difference between the photographs of other towns’ borders. Again, don’t laugh here, but I’ve never seen a photograph. I don’t know anybody who has ever seen a photograph. It’s a very small town.

In general, anytime I heard something about vision, I kind of glossed over it. For example, I always heard things in person, online, and in our tape library about how everybody knows “The Sky is Blue.” It’s a truism. A fact. So, this may be hard to imagine for you guys out there, with your rumbling buses and roaring planes to move you all over, but I assumed we had the same sky. Don’t all towns? Our sky occasionally drips down what we all call rain. And you can hear the wind sighing up there. It never blows as hard as I hear it does in some places. We don’t have tornadoes like Oklahoma, but it does blow hard enough to tussle our hair. A hot wet breath that blows down from above. Sometimes the wind is so hot and strong and foul, that you’d swear the sky was crawling around you.

And it’s blue. Perhaps not your blue, but when I turn my face to sky I always get the same kind of vision: this warmth that eventually burns my face if I stare too long, this overwhelming feeling of being connected to everybody else in town, this nakedness as if all my thoughts were dumped out around me on the steel and rubber for anybody to rummage through, this horrible pawing through my mind, something hot and invasive like long and bony fingers fumbling through my memories. Anybody that I’ve spoken to all describe blue, in about the same way. They all agree that the sky is quite blue. 

Visions. Geez, this is pretty embarrassing, so I’ve been dancing around this issue. What we in Town call visions, I think people have other words for it. It’s regarded as paranormal, or hoaxes, or delusions. Everybody here though, has them. In Town, it’s not something controversial. What I think you guys call sight; I don’t know if we even talk about that here. I think my confusion about vision might also explain some of my confusion about circumcision. 

Please don’t laugh at this, but I had no idea that I was uncircumcised. I knew people had something removed at the hospital when they were young. I had no idea that it was a part of the penis. Even some people in town laughed at me about this. My Uncle Clive, was dying laughing when he found out that I thought babies were born with foreskin on their eyes.

It’s a good community, but we need help. Our main source of food is cattle. I was out at the barns last week, checking up on the newest calves, just checking hydration levels, temps, and sewing their lips together, the usual, and I was downright shocked at how many of the cages were vacant. The usual earthy funk of defecation weighed in the air, but lighter than normal.

We’ve had limited success in breeding. Part of that might be the barn conditions, if I’m being frank. Whenever I clean old cages, it’s not uncommon to find a lot of blood and skin scraped onto the steel, usually from where they try to escape. I’ve read a bit about free range methods, but I have no idea how anybody can manage that. Even with their lips sewn shut, our cattle are constantly trying to run for the city limits whenever we let them out of their cages. The lip thing might be animal cruelty, but it’s almost impossible to work with the cattle when you have to listen to them babble on about their own sky visions. It’s like geez, we all see weird shit if we look at the sky. No need to be so dramatic; just keep your head down. Some people say that there’s something wrong with the cattle’s eyes, and their eyes do feel weird. They’re wet and slimy like a spider, but much squishier.

The spiders are really the only other animals in town, and eating them isn’t even an option. They’re just far too bright to try it. Occasionally, they fall to the ground, but like I warn my nephews, don’t go near them. If you hear them rasping out that breezy sound, just stay away. This may not make a lot of sense for you guys in the city, because your spiders sound a lot different. Fuzzy brown house spiders are nothing like the spiders we have in town. Yellow ceiling spiders are closer, but they sound both too small and too fat. Our spiders are bright blue, so bright that a few people have been blinded from messing with them. I have a cousin that picked up one, because the little goof thought that the spider was dead. He said it was damp with rain and quiet and still. He carried the friggin thing into Uncle Clive’s house. His brother didn’t see the thing until he stepped on it. The flash was so bright that neighbors came running from a block over. The poor kid was in shock for weeks after that. The way my cousin describes it, the spider sounds comparable to sea spiders. However, we’re nowhere near any sea. I’ve never heard a wave or encountered any boats, but hey, now I’m getting off topic.

I guess I’ve been beating around the bush, but we need help. With city limits being so firm here, we’ve had to survive without much outside interaction. I guess we live in a “food desert” because there are no grocery stores in town, and we can’t exactly drive to another town. I’m unfamiliar with canned goods (I know, I know, what a rube), but willing to try them. What we really need though are cattle. Preferably full grown, or at least with the hair growing around their shanks. If we have to wait a decade for the cattle to mature, we might have some starvation before they’re ready for harvesting. Also, at the risk of ending up on choosy beggars, I’d really prefer it if the hind legs were broken when the cattle arrive. It’s so much easier to manage them when they aren’t constantly rearing up on their hind legs, and trying to escape.

Really anything you can give would be of help. Our town isn’t on Google maps, and the signs here don’t have any words on them as far as I can feel. But I can give our coordinates.

I’ve been working the Storm Sweep Team for a few months now. 

Our team has two sections. The first team collects the bodies of those people unfortunate enough to be caught out in the open without any proper protection during a virus downpour. Due to the contagiousness of the virus and the fact that it kills 20% of anyone that it touches, we typically find 4 to 6 bodies lying in the streets after a storm has passed. 

The second team will spray the storm area with disinfectant to neutralize any rain/virus droplets that have collected in the area. We do our best to spray every nook and cranny so that no living virus is left. It has been found from our scientists, that the virus can live in small pools of water for up to 9 days.  

The sight of a rainbow is now taken as a bad omen. For some reason, water droplets that contain the virus, cause light to reflect more intensely, causing bigger and brighter rainbows to form during a virus downpour.  Seeing a rainbow now, gives everyone a sense of doom, as typically we find one or two bodies where the rainbow appeared. 

I heard on the news that our experts are still working hard on some type of vaccine, but this virus seems to be keeping one step ahead of them with its various mutations, nullifying anything that they come up with. 

Predicting the weather and which storms that may be infected with the virus, is one of the top priorities of our experts. Theories for the cause of these virus storms range from the simple:  Flocks of birds infected with the virus, fly through the clouds shedding the virus into the water particles, to the absurd conspiracy theories, Alien saucers are seeding the atmosphere with the deadly virus.  Hopefully they will find the source and give us a way to stop the virus storms from forming. 

Who knows… maybe the new satellites being launched this week with their new bio-sensors, will be able to detect virus infected clouds, giving us a better chance at providing warnings to the general population before there is a virus downpour.  The biggest fear is the possibility of hurricane size virus storms forming, taking out large sections of the country.

Breaking Galactic News report---- 

The Star Liner Cruise company has been fined 10 billion credits due to its pollution of sector 32. 

While traveling through sector 32, near the 3rd planet of that system, a crew member of Cruise ship X8800 discovered an unattended discharge port had been breached, allowing a small quantity of the Cronos waste storage tank contents to be released into that section of space. The stream of Cronos waste material crossed the path of only the 3rd and 4th planets of this system. Due to the benign nature of this waste material, we do not anticipate any problems with any life forms in this section.   

The 3rd planet has been designated a no contact zone due to the violent/primitive nature of this planet, so no actions were taken at the time of contamination. It has been initially determined that the bulk of the waste material released in this sector will dissipate within three solar cycles of the 3rd planet. 

It has been recommended that a follow up survey team be dispatched to this sector at a later time, to access any environmental impact on this section of space. The Star Liner Cruise company issued an apology and have taken steps to ensure that its Star Liners comply to the high standards of no pollution, set in place by the Galactic Committe.",t2_1640li,False,,0,False,Partly sunny with a chance of virus showers in the afternoon.,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fh07py,False,dark,,public,28,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,28,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583974184.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working the Storm Sweep Team for a few months now. &lt;/p&gt;

When we stepped outside, Erik was about to storm towards the school, but I stopped him.

From afar, I noticed the dark silhouettes of the students still searching the school grounds and pointed at them.

“Who in the hell?” Erik asked in a whisper.

“Other students, they’re searching for me, I think.”

Erik nodded, but said nothing. I’d never seen him this serious  before, but I was happy he understood how wrong this whole situation  was.

We inched forward alongside the dorm until we reached the front  corner. When we looked at the school, we could see someone moving in  front of the building.

I cursed to myself. Dammit, Kim, why’d you have to act on your own!?

‘Where are you?’ I asked her via text.

‘Inside, second floor. Are you coming?’

‘Yes.’

There was no time to waste. I waited a bit to make sure none of the  strange students were close by, then I signaled Erik. We rushed from the  dorm towards the school and reached the school building after a minute  or two.

From our position, we could see the front door. Whoever had been  there had moved on. I could tell that they wouldn’t think I’d make my  way into the school.

At night the building looked different. The windows were dark, and  everything seemed so empty. It gave the place an almost eerie  atmosphere.

“Damn, never thought I’d be going to school at night,” Erik whispered to me.

I nudged him and gave him an angry stare to make him drop the jokes.

The moment we reached the front door, we found it unlocked. Why the hell was it even open?

With as little noise as possible, I cracked the heavy door and peeked  inside while Erik kept a lookout. There was no sign that anyone else  was around.

Once we were inside, we moved away from the door and listened for a while. We heard nothing.

We tiptoed down the hallway to our left, but it wasn’t long when noises erupted ahead of us. Shit, so someone was there.

We snuck into an empty classroom to our right and waited. A dark figure moved down past the door, continuing on past our room.

“What was that?”

“Teachers,” I answered matter-of-factly.

He gave me a confused look before he nodded.

We soon made it to the stairs at the back and continued on to the  second floor. Darkness shrouded the whole building, transforming the  long, empty hallways into ghastly tunnels.

Knowing that we weren’t alone in the building didn’t help, not at  all. Every door we passed seemed like a trap, and I could already see  some angry, twisted teacher storming out to get us. We inched forward,  step by step, almost jumping past each door.

Where the hell was Kim? I asked her again, and a reply arrived after a few seconds.

‘The construction area. Near the principal’s office.’

All right, I thought, we had to get to the end of this hallway, then past the main staircase and down another hallway.

As we moved on, we suddenly heard a voice nearby. We both pushed  ourselves against the wall and listened. The blood was rushing through  my veins, and my heart pounded in my chest. Yet, the voice didn’t come  closer.

After a long minute had passed, we continued on. The voice grew  louder, but we soon realized it was coming from a classroom. What the  hell was going on?

The moment we looked past the cracked door, we saw Mr. Wolfram, the  biology teacher inside. He stood motionless behind his desk in the dark  classroom. At first, I didn’t get what he was doing and thought he was  talking to himself.

“... and so the mitochondrion is responsible for the...”

When I saw the textbook he was holding, I realized what he was doing.  He was rehearsing class, all by himself, a dark classroom in the middle  of the night. Every once in a while, his voice cracked, becoming  distorted. When that happened, he’d stop and start the sentence anew.

I shivered as I watched. Erik, who stood next to me, froze in a  mixture of fascination and horror. When I tipped his shoulder, he jerked  and stared at me with wide eyes before we moved on.

We soon reached the main stair case. There was no one there, so we hurried past it and continued on down another hallway.

Suddenly, a figure stepped out of a room ahead of us. We both froze.

I recognized the face. It was our history teacher, Mr. Mann.

The moment he saw us, his eyes focused on us.

“... thus the Roman Empire,” he started. His voice didn’t seem to  work, though. It trailed off, coming out high-pitched and distorted  before he stopped again.

His face became empty, the skin almost sagging as he stared right  past us. Then it contorted from a mixture of concentration and  puzzlement.

Erik and I just stood there, about to run, but Mr. Mann didn’t move  at all and said nothing. It was as if he’d stopped and forgot how to  function.

We inched past him, afraid he’d reach out for us, but he didn’t move, didn’t even speak.

We’d already crossed half the hallway when we he spoke again.

“... The Roman Empire started an invasion,” he continued on, reciting his lecture as he vanished down the stairs.

“Dude,” Erik pressed out, staring after him.

“No clue, maybe he’s broken or something?”

Erik said nothing, but I saw him shudder.

After a few more seconds, we reached the end of the hallway and the  starting point of the construction area. Materials and tools had been  placed haphazardly next to the sturdy metal door that led to the west  wing.

We saw a small figure standing near the door.

“Kim,” I called out in a hushed whisper.

She gave us a short nod, and Erik and I hurried towards her. For a  moment, she looked at us before she focused on the heavy metal door  ahead. Right behind it was the principal’s office, the only room in the  west wing that was still in use these days.

“Dammit Kim, let’s get out of here! What the hell were you thinking?!”

“We need evidence,” she said in a low voice.

I turned towards her. How could she be so calm in this situation?

“Shit! It won’t open!” Erik cursed in a low voice.

I watched as he pushed himself against the heavy door while twisting the handle.

“Dude, it’s not moving! We should-“

His eyes grew wide, and he broke up, staring at something behind me.

When I turned, I saw a tall figure standing behind Kim. Terror flooded over me when I noticed the twisted face of Mrs. Wolf.

“Kim, watch out!” I called out, but the small Asian girl didn’t move  at all. I took one step forward, but stopped when I could make out her  face for the first time. It was devoid of any emotion, her eyes empty,  and her mouth hanging half-open.

My hands dropped to my side, and my legs almost gave way as all  strength left my body. That wasn’t Kim, I realized. We’d been had.

I started to think. When was the last time I’d spoken to her face to  face? When had I last seen her? Yesterday? The day before? God, how long  ago had they taken her? They must’ve noticed that I’d texted with her  and used that to lure me here. How the hell had I not thought about  that? How the hell could I’ve been that stupid!?

Mrs. Wolf stepped right past Kim, and with two more enormous steps,  she stood right in front of me. She was huge, had become a hulking,  twisted abomination, even worse than the one Mrs. Thomas had turned  into.

“I’m here to help you, Steven,” the creature said in a mocking, distorted voice of my homeroom teacher’s voice.

Her huge hands reached out for me, but right at that moment, Erik’s backpack hit her straight in the face.

“What the hell’s that thing!?” Erik screamed.

“We’ve got to get away from,” he screamed, but his voice was cut off  when one of Mrs. Wolf’s giant hands closed around his head. She yanked  him back, holding him up like a child would a doll. He dangled from her  grip, beating against the elongated arm of the creature, but Mrs. Wolf  didn’t even to notice. She pushed her head forward, bringing it right in  front of Erik’s and started giggling.

I was frozen, staring at the horrific creature in front of me. My  consciousness was pushed back, and my survival instincts took over. I  turned away, started running, but I’d barely taken a step when something  jumped me.

It was Kim! She was right on top of me, pushing me to the ground. I  twisted, struggled, and clawed at her, but it had no effect. I should’ve  been able to push her off, but the girl’s small body was much stronger  than should’ve been possible. For a few more moments, I struggled before  she restrained me. There was nothing I could do, nothing but look at  Mrs. Wolf and Erik.

She was still holding him in her grasp as she stepped forward towards  the heavy, sturdy metal door. With her one remaining hand, she pushed  it open as if it took no effort at all.

There should’ve been a hallway behind that door. I knew the school building continued on, construction or not.

What I saw instead was something else, something I didn’t understand.  It was shifting and pushing itself around in the darkness ahead.

It was flesh, liquid, gooey flesh, a giant pulsating thing, no, a  giant mess of flesh that filled out the entire hallway. I stared at it  in utter disbelief and terror. In the darkness, I thought I saw pores  and gashes open and close on the surface.

My mouth hung open, and a short laugh escaped me as my sanity slipped  away. I felt something, a hand, cover my mouth, but I didn’t even  react. Instead, I stared at the unbelievable, surrealistic horror in  front of me. My mind had stopped working and was nothing but a blank.

As Mrs. Wolf pushed her giant hand into one of the crevices on the thing’s surface, it glowed in a low purplish light.

I watched as something pushed itself outward. There was a head, then  an upper body, and I realized I was looking at the principal. I saw more  bodies, though, and faces, all below the surface in that gooey mass.  Limbs too, some moving, some twitching, others dangling lifelessly  before they were swallowed up again.

Her other arm surged forward, throwing Erik at the principal. In an  instant, he opened his mouth, and countless, small, fleshy tentacles  erupted from it. More and more of them pushed from the unhinged jaw of  the principal. They entwined him like vines, searching and probing his  body.

Erik screamed in pure terror, started tearing them off himself, but  there had to be hundreds of them. Moments later, one of them tore into  his body, and soon others followed. Erik’s mouth was still open, but  there were no more screams now. Instead, his body twitched and  convulsed.

I’d expected the thing to pull him forward and swallow him. Instead, I saw his body wither away as the tentacles sucked him dry.

At the same time, I saw how something new formed below the fleshy  surface. At first, it was nothing but a twitching thing, but then I saw a  head, a body, then arms and legs. Moments later, I stared at a complete  replica of Erik’s face that pushed itself forward from the pulsating  mess.

I heard, no, almost felt a voice reverberating from around me.

“First ones were all wrong, not working. We learned. We improved. We are better now. Much better.”

I tried to figure out who was speaking, but Mrs. Wolf’s mouth was  closed, and so was Kim’s. No, what I was hearing was the fleshy mess in  front of me, speaking from the dozens of faces incorporated inside of  its body. The organism was musing on, mocking me.

Erik’s copy pushed itself outside from one of the many crevices and  slumped down to the floor. For a moment, the disgusting, wet body  twitched and shock itself as if it was learning how to function. Legs  began moving, then arms, and finally, its eyes opened. At first, nothing  but a click escaped the thing’s mouth before it spoke in a distorted  version of Erik’s voice.

“Hey dude, hey dude, hey dude,” it repeated, testing its voice until  it seemed to have gotten it right. Then it picked up the clothes still  dangling from the withered, bony remains of my friend and put them on.

Right at this moment, I Kim’s weight on top of me shifted. I used all  my remaining strength and pushed myself upward. Escape was impossible,  but it gave me enough room to rip her hand from my mouth. It was only  for a moment, but at that moment, I screamed at the top of my lungs.

It was over after only a few seconds. She pushed me to the ground  once more and with such force that it sent my world spinning. For a  moment, my vision went dark before I was dragged forward.

Erik, no, his copy, was gone, but Mrs. Wolf was still there. The  creature pushed her twisted visage close to my face and grinned at me  before I heard footsteps from the staircase.

Mrs. Wolf’s face retreated as she twisted her head around to stare  down the hallway. Her body collapse into itself, and she returned to her  human form. In a second, she’d stepped towards the heavy metal door and  threw it.

“Now what’s going on over there? Is that you, Schmidt? Brandt? I know you’re there! I saw you get in and-“

He broke up when he saw Kim, Mrs. Wolf, and me. I was still on the ground, twisting against Kim and trying to get free.

“Mr. Siegert, good to see you. This student snuck into the school to  cause havoc. You know who he is, right? When he saw me, he tried to  sneak up on me and attack me! We were lucky enough to restrain him!”

The old man stared at Mrs. Wolf and Kim in utter bewilderment.

“It’s the middle of the night. Why are you here, Mrs. Wolf? And why’s that girl here?”

“Should you be worried about those things? That boy here has been causing trouble for days now, so-“

“Then let the boy speak, dammit! I haven’t gotten the slightest clue  what’s going on anymore. Hell, I saw Mr. Wolfram and Mr. Mann down  there. What’s up with all this?”

For a moment, everyone was quiet, and no one moved.

Then Kim released me and jumped the old man. In confusion, he  screamed up, and with speed, no one thought possible, he pushed the girl  off himself.

“What the hell’s wrong with you!?”

He screamed at her as he tried to restrain her. Kim was much stronger  than he’d expected, and in a moment, she got free and jumped him again,  going for his neck. In shock and surprise, he tore her off himself  again and threw her to the ground.

She came to a rest, her head twisted in a strange angle. I saw the disbelief on the old man’s face, then the panic.

“No, dammit, I didn’t mean to,” he said in a shaky voice.

I was up again, rushed to his side, and pulled at his arm.

“Mr. Siegert! We’ve got to get out of here! They will kill us!”

For a moment, he just stared at me before he got a grip of himself.  It was too late, though. Mrs. Wolf’s body twisted and changed, and in a  second, she was upon Mrs. Siegert. The old man could barely get a hold  of his radio. He screamed, called something indistinguishable into it  before Mrs. Wolf overpowered him and tore the device off him.

As Mrs. Wolf threw the old man towards the heavy metal door, I ran  off. Pain shot through my whole body as I rushed down the stairs.

I turned right, towards the front door, but I saw someone ahead of  me. It had to be one of the other teachers, or hell a student. They were  coming for me! In a panic, I turned right and entered one of the  classrooms. Windows, there are windows, I remembered. I reached one, and  as I twisted the handle, a thundering, twisted teacher entered the  room. The creature screamed up, but I was already on the windowsill and a  moment later outside.

The landing pushed the air from my lungs, but I fought myself back to  my feet. I tasted blood in my mouth, my lungs were burning, and I  almost collapsed.

Still, I stumbled onward and screamed at the top of my lungs, hoping to wake people asleep in the dorms.

After a few more steps, I crashed to the ground, exhausted. I fought  myself back up and dragged myself forward. Out, I had to get out of  here. Each new step was a fight, each scream a tremendous effort. I saw  someone else rushing from the school behind me.

“Now, now, Steven, where are you going? Shouldn’t you be in your dorm room?”

It was Mr. Wolfram, leisurely coming after me. I screamed again, and  by now, I saw lights turning on in one of the dorm buildings. Yes,  someone must’ve heard me, I thought. Please, oh god, please come  outside!

I didn’t see anyone, though, and after a few more steps, I fell to  the ground. This time I didn’t have the energy to go on anymore.

A few moments later, Mr. Wolfram reached me. A mocking grin distorted  his face as he stared down at me. With his massive hands, he pulled me  upwards. He was about to lead me, no, to drag me back towards the school  building when I heard the sounds of police sirens.

Mr. Wolfram let go of me when he saw a police car stopping at the get to the school.

The two police officers unlocked the gate and entered the school  grounds. Alerted by the sirens, students streamed from the dorms, trying  to see what was happening.

The officers made their way towards Mr. Wolfram and me. I quickly  freed myself from the teacher’s hands and stumbled towards them. Just  before I reached them, I heard a voice from behind.

“Now what brings you here tonight, officers?” a female voice said.

When I turned around, my eyes grew wide. It was Mrs. Wolf. In tow  with her was the security guard Mr. Siegert, or a copy of him, I  thought.

“Siegert, what’s the problem here? You tried to contact us via the  radio, but all we heard was chaos,” one of the officers spoke up.

“There was a break-in at the school building. I thought it might have  been a trespasser and was going to call for backup, but this thing  here,” he pointed at his radio, “started malfunctioning. Turns out, it  was this boy here, trying to cause some trouble. Sorry, you made the  trip all the way here.”

No, this was wrong.

“Well, guess that’s it. You better get that radio of yours fixed. All  we heard was a distortion. It sounded like someone was screaming. You  want us to take the boy in?”

“No, it wasn’t anything serious. Guess he wanted to pull a prank on some of the teachers.”

“No!” I screamed up with a cracking voice.

“There’s something at the school! It’s some sort of monster, and they are killing people and-“

“Oh, be quiet, Steven! Enough of your pranks already! This is not a game anymore!” Mrs. Wolf cut in.

I stumbled towards the officer. “It’s true! They murdered my friend!”

“Hey man, let’s go back already, I don’t want to get into more trouble,” I heard Erik’s voice.

My eyes grew wide as I stared at his copy.

“You should listen to your friend, Steven,” Mr. Siegert chimed in.

The police officers eyed me for a moment before they sighed.

“Well, we’ll be going. Next time you lie to an officer, there’ll be  consequences, boy. Now go back to sleep. You can handle the rest, right,  Siegert?”

“Yeah, no problem.”

No, don’t leave me. They will kill me, too. No.

I stared at them and watched as they turned around and walked back to  the police car. Mrs. Wolf and Mr. Siegert were already coming towards  me.

“Well, boy, time to get back,” Mr. Siegert said, and I felt a cold,  hard hand on my shoulder. His eyes were wide, his mouth twisted and  grinning. With each second, his fingers dug deeper into my shoulder.

“Let go of me!” I screamed and threw myself forward. I rushed one of  the police officers and reached for his gun, but I didn’t get to touch  it. The man pushed me to the ground and restrained me in an instant,  twisting my arm behind my back.

“You crazy, boy?”

“Fuck you, you piece of shit!” I screamed at him and spat in his face.

“Now you’ve done it,” he said, his face hard.

I watched as he took out his handcuffs and put them on me.

“You’ve just earned yourself a night at the station,” he said in a hard voice as he pulled me upward.

As he said this, I smiled and grinned back at the gathered group of twisted beings and fakes behind me.

“Now, now, is this really necessary? He’s just a boy,” Mr. Siegert started again.

“This boy attacked a police officer and tried to take his gun. This is no damned prank anymore, Siegert!”

I couldn’t help but laugh when they pushed me into the police car.  They frowned, their faces contorted by a mixture of anger and confusion.  Yet, I couldn’t stop. I’d made it! I got away! The only thing that  mattered was that I was alive. I didn’t care about anything else. All I  could do was to laugh out of sheer relief.

As they drove off, I could finally calm down and relaxed in the back of the car.

“Now what the hell’s wrong with you, boy?” one of them asked.

Before I could say anything, his colleague spoke up.

“Kid’s probably on drugs or something, no reason to talk to him right now.”

As he said this, he eyed me in the back of the car. When he saw my beaming expression, his frown deepened.

At the station, they lead me to a cell in the back. By now, I’d calmed down.

They opened the cuffs, set me down, and one of the officers took a seat opposite me.

“So, what did you take, kid?”

“Nothing.”

The cop grinned. “We’ll have a blood test anyway, so you might as well come clean now.”

“I swear, nothing.”

“All right, why the hell would you attack us and try to get a hand of officer Schuster’s gun?”

For a moment, I almost burst out about the thing in the west wing and  the copies of teachers and students, but I stopped myself. There was no  way they, or anyone else for the matter, would believe me. I had to be  smart about this. Think, Steven, think dammit.

“They’d have murdered me if I didn’t.”

“Who are they?”

“Mrs. Wolf, the teacher and Mr. Siegert, the night guard.”

“Now tell me, boy, why’d they do something like that?”

Think, Steven, think. The cop stared me down, his face growing  angrier by the second. He opened his mouth to say something, but before  he could, I spoke up again.

“Drugs,” I almost yelled.

“They’re hiding drugs at the school! I wasn’t able to sleep, so I  went out for a walk and saw Mrs. Wolf, Mr. Siegert, and the principal  enter the school. They had money and a package or something with them.  It looked weird, so I followed them. I heard them talk about drugs,  about the money they needed, and how they would sell ‘the stuff.’ When  they saw me, they-“

I was cut off as the man brought his fist down on the table.

“Bullshit! Drugs? Are you fucking kidding me?”

His partner, who was standing outside, spoke up.

“What are you trying to pull here, kid?”

“Why do you think those teachers were there in the middle of the  night? Why do you think I’m all beaten up, and they said they’d handle  it by themselves? Why would I lie about something like that? No one  would believe me!”

“Hah, you’ve got that right,” the officer sitting opposite me said, laughing.

“You’ll stay here for the night. Don’t cause any more trouble, you got that?”

I nodded.

With that, the two of them left the cell and locked it behind me.

As I laid down on the bed, I listened to them.

“The hell kind of bullshit story was that?” of them asked the other.

“No clue, kid’s crazy, all right, but there might be something about it.”

“God dammit Robert, you think there’s something to the kid’s story?”

“Nah, doubt it, but something about his story rubbed me the wrong way.”

As they walked off, their voices faded, and I wasn’t able to make out what they said anymore.

Only I lay down on the bed I felt the pain all over my body and  noticed the countless bruises. I didn’t get to think about them much  because I fell asleep instantly.

I woke up when someone in front of the cell yelled my name. I opened  my eyes and pushed myself up. After blinking a few times, I recognized  the figure. It was dad, and he was furious.

“Couldn’t believe it when they called me! Thought it was some kind of  joke, but here you are, Steven. This time you’ve outdone yourself!”

“Dad! What are you doing here?”

“What do you think, dammit? They called me right in the morning,  telling me my son’s locked up here! Because he attacked a police officer  of all things. What the hell’s wrong with you?”

“Dad, there was-“

“Quiet! We’ll talk once we’re out of here!”

An officer walked up next to him and opened the cell.

“Well, Mr. Schmidt, your son can leave for now. He’s still a minor,  but attacking an officer’s still no laughing matter. There will be  consequences for what he did.”

As he said this, his eyes wandered from dad to me and back to him. Dad nodded and gave me an angry, frustrated stare.

He led me from the station without saying another word, we made our way to his car.

“Dad, I’m sorry,” I said as he started the car.

Dad didn’t react. Instead, he just stared ahead as he drove from the station.

I settled into my seat, thinking about how to explain to him what had happened. Well, or better, what I should tell him.

My head wandered to the car’s clock, and I saw that it was already  past ten in the morning. I wondered if the police would investigate the  school. If they did, would it mean they’d find that thing, and it would  all be over? What the hell was that thing?

In my mind, the events from last night replayed, and I shuddered. How could something like that be real?

Multiple times I opened my mouth to tell dad what had happened, to tell him something, but I just couldn’t.

It was only after we’d driven for a good ten minutes that I wondered where we were going. Our home was in a different direction.

“Dad, aren’t we going home?”

Once again, he didn’t say a thing.

“Dad, where are we going?”

At that moment, I noticed the street we were on and the direction we were going in. Don’t tell me...

“You’re going back to school, Steven,” dad answered matter-of-factly, still staring straight ahead.

“What!? No, we can’t! Dad, there’s something weird going on there, people are dying and-“

“I talked to the principal in person this morning, son. Nothing is going on there.”

At that moment, I saw how his face distorted into a grin, and his eyes grew wider and wider with each passing moment.

Dear god, no. “Dad?” I brought out in a low voice.

Nothing. His hands closed around the steering wheel as he sped up.

Panic washed over me again. No, I couldn’t go back there. In a  moment, I removed my seat belt and reached for the door. One of my dad’s  hands jerked over and pushed me back into my seat.

“We’re going back, son,” he said, and right away, I heard the  distortion in his voice. With an insane amount of strength he pushed me  back to the seat. When he turned towards me, his face had grown long,  changed into a twisted caricature of my dad’s.

I struggled, tore at the hand and fingers, but I couldn’t get them  off me. I twisted my body, lifted my feet, and kicked the thing next to  me with all the force I could muster.

There was no reaction, no sound of pain, nothing. I did it again, a  third time, and finally, the hand released me to get a hold of my legs. I  screamed in pain as the creature twisted my legs, but this time I kept  struggling. I frantically tore at the car door, got it open for a  moment, but was pulled back in an instant.

I saw the school coming up ahead. In an act of sheer desperation, I  could free one of my legs and kicked the steering wheel as hard as I  could. The thing’s one hand wasn’t enough to hold it steady. The car  swerved to the left and crashed against a small tree.

My head collided with the dashboard of the car. I saw stars, tasted  blood, and for a moment, my vision turned dark. As I drifted off, I  screamed at myself to stay awake and fought against the dark haze that  filled my mind.

I jerked up.

The car wasn’t moving anymore. The thing next to me was though its  hand was still on my leg, twisting it, the fingers digging into skin and  flesh. I screamed and started beating against the hand that held on to  me.

Metal twisted and churn, and I saw that the creature broken and  trapped behind the steering wheel. Strange liquids were leaking from its  body. His mouth was wide open, and it let out a distorted scream.

I continued to beat down on the hand. Its fingers dug into my flesh  as I kept at it. Beating it again and again and finally something gave  way, and the mangled and broken fingers slip off.

In an instant, I opened the car door and pushed myself outside. I  fell to the ground and crawled a few paces before I felt safe enough to  catch my breath. The thing in the car was still moving, still trying to  break free, and once more, I heard the churning of meat. I knew it  wouldn’t be long. With its strength, it was only a matter of time before  it would get free. And, I knew it would come after me again.

As I got to my feet, I saw the police cars in front of the school.

“Yes!” I screamed up in excitement. They’d gone after all!

I already saw a police officer approaching me. Others had turned  towards the accident, too. I started running, but then slowed down  before I stopped.

The way the man was walking was all wrong. The way the others did as  well. The faces that had turned towards me were devoid of all emotions.

“That’s the boy,” one of them said.

I ran right away. I threw myself forward and rushed towards the  forest surrounding the school grounds. I didn’t turn, and I didn’t  listen. My body should’ve been in sheer pain, but I felt nothing. It had  to be the adrenalin, the shock, I thought.

I reached the first trees, then I was between them, and then I ran  deeper into the forest. My vision got blurry again, but I pushed myself  on and on, past the dark silhouettes the trees had become.

I ran until my legs gave way and I crashed to the forest floor. For  long moments I could do nothing but lay there before I pushed myself  back up and continued crawling forward.

From where I was, I saw a small ditch below a fallen tree. I clawed  at the ground with my remaining strength, pulled myself forward, and  eventually slid inside.

For long minutes I lay there, shaking with pain and exhaustion. I’d  have screamed up, but I didn’t even have the energy left to do so.

I don’t know how long it took me to move again. When I could, I turned my head slightly to look outside.

At first, there was nothing, but soon I saw that the police was searching for me.

They weren’t looking human at all, though. It looked as if someone  had put random limbs together into weird, twisted creatures. They were  moving faster, quicker than humans, I thought. Some were rushing  forward, jumping between trees. Others walked on all fours, almost like  primates. There were no words, all I could hear were strange, inhuman  clicking noises.

For hours, I lay there in that small ditch, and for hours the  clicking noises and sounds of movement were all around me. Multiple  times I thought they had left only for them to come back.

Only once night descended, silence return to the forest, and I passed out from exhaustion and injury.

When I woke up, my whole body was hurting. Pushing myself from the  small ditch was a painful ordeal. When I was out, I looked around, but I  did not understand where I was. I stumbled through the forest  haphazardly. It was by pure chance that I found a small hiking trail.

I didn’t care where I was going. I just wanted to get away as far  from here as possible. Away from the school and away from those damned  things.

After a while, I noticed that the trail led me up into the hills that surrounded the school. Good, I thought.

My body was aching, and when I noticed a small resting area, I  approached it instantly. I sank down on a bench to catch my breath but  forced myself not to lie down.

It took me a while to realize how far I’d made it. From where I was, I  could look over the area below. I saw the hills, the road, the distant  town and the school.

As I scanned it, I saw the strange purplish hue coming from the west  wing. I could see the scaffold moving. No, I realized, it wasn’t the  scaffold, it was the thing below.

For the first time, I saw the many holes and burrows in the  construction area. I wondered why they were there, but soon I knew. That  thing, they must’ve come upon it during their construction. By now,  there was no construction going on anymore, no there was an excavation.  They were laying this thing, whatever it was, bare so it could free  itself from the ground. I saw countless dark figures moving around the  area.

As I watched them, the sun dawned, and I noticed the handful of buses that had arrived in front of the school.

I saw groups of students leaving the dorms and lining up next to  them. I couldn’t be sure, but from a distance, it seemed as if they were  all still, diligently waiting to get on.

The field trips. Oh, god, all those students, I thought. They were all copies, all part of this thing.

I’d thought those field trips were nothing but a ploy or a trick to  get rid of anyone who’d figured out what was going on, but they were  actually happening.

And I realized why. To spread it. To get this thing or parts of it  out of here. So it could get to universities and other schools nearby.  So it could learn, could spread and create new clusters.

I tore myself from the view and continued on, following the various  hiking tracks of the area. It must’ve been hours before I made it to a  normal road.

I didn’t have a clear plan, hell, I didn’t even have an idea. All I could do was walk on.

It was by sheer chance that I stumbled upon a small roadside diner.

The owner stared at me in a mixture of confusion and worry.

“You all right, boy? Need me to call you an ambulance?”

I stared at him, probing his face and his behavior, but the mixture of emotions on his face told me he had to be normal.

“My phone, I need to charge it. I’ve got to call my parents,” I said.

The man nodded, and after a while, he handed me a charger and pointed me towards a power outlet.

As my phone charged, I started writing this. I left soon after. I’ve been on my way for days now, writing this out.

I’ve tried to find help and thought about going to the police. But  wherever I go, I see the same emotionless faces, the same empty eyes and  hear the same monotonous voice.

I don’t know what to do anymore. There’s no way I can stop this, no  way I could do anything. So please, if you read this, be careful where  you go and who you talk to. If you notice anything, inform the  authorities.

There’s an invasion underway. And there’s one thing I know. The  further this thing spreads, the more it learns, and the more it will  know how to act like us.

But by now, it might already be too late. By now, these things might very well be indiscernible from normal humans.

&lt;p&gt;When we stepped outside, Erik was about to storm towards the school, but I stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From afar, I noticed the dark silhouettes of the students still searching the school grounds and pointed at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who in the hell?” Erik asked in a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Other students, they’re searching for me, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik nodded, but said nothing. I’d never seen him this serious  before, but I was happy he understood how wrong this whole situation  was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We inched forward alongside the dorm until we reached the front  corner. When we looked at the school, we could see someone moving in  front of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cursed to myself. Dammit, Kim, why’d you have to act on your own!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Where are you?’ I asked her via text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Inside, second floor. Are you coming?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yes.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no time to waste. I waited a bit to make sure none of the  strange students were close by, then I signaled Erik. We rushed from the  dorm towards the school and reached the school building after a minute  or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our position, we could see the front door. Whoever had been  there had moved on. I could tell that they wouldn’t think I’d make my  way into the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night the building looked different. The windows were dark, and  everything seemed so empty. It gave the place an almost eerie  atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Damn, never thought I’d be going to school at night,” Erik whispered to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nudged him and gave him an angry stare to make him drop the jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment we reached the front door, we found it unlocked. Why the hell was it even open?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With as little noise as possible, I cracked the heavy door and peeked  inside while Erik kept a lookout. There was no sign that anyone else  was around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were inside, we moved away from the door and listened for a while. We heard nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tiptoed down the hallway to our left, but it wasn’t long when noises erupted ahead of us. Shit, so someone was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We snuck into an empty classroom to our right and waited. A dark figure moved down past the door, continuing on past our room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What was that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Teachers,” I answered matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave me a confused look before he nodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon made it to the stairs at the back and continued on to the  second floor. Darkness shrouded the whole building, transforming the  long, empty hallways into ghastly tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that we weren’t alone in the building didn’t help, not at  all. Every door we passed seemed like a trap, and I could already see  some angry, twisted teacher storming out to get us. We inched forward,  step by step, almost jumping past each door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the hell was Kim? I asked her again, and a reply arrived after a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The construction area. Near the principal’s office.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I thought, we had to get to the end of this hallway, then past the main staircase and down another hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we moved on, we suddenly heard a voice nearby. We both pushed  ourselves against the wall and listened. The blood was rushing through  my veins, and my heart pounded in my chest. Yet, the voice didn’t come  closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long minute had passed, we continued on. The voice grew  louder, but we soon realized it was coming from a classroom. What the  hell was going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment we looked past the cracked door, we saw Mr. Wolfram, the  biology teacher inside. He stood motionless behind his desk in the dark  classroom. At first, I didn’t get what he was doing and thought he was  talking to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“... and so the mitochondrion is responsible for the...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the textbook he was holding, I realized what he was doing.  He was rehearsing class, all by himself, a dark classroom in the middle  of the night. Every once in a while, his voice cracked, becoming  distorted. When that happened, he’d stop and start the sentence anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shivered as I watched. Erik, who stood next to me, froze in a  mixture of fascination and horror. When I tipped his shoulder, he jerked  and stared at me with wide eyes before we moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon reached the main stair case. There was no one there, so we hurried past it and continued on down another hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a figure stepped out of a room ahead of us. We both froze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognized the face. It was our history teacher, Mr. Mann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment he saw us, his eyes focused on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“... thus the Roman Empire,” he started. His voice didn’t seem to  work, though. It trailed off, coming out high-pitched and distorted  before he stopped again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His face became empty, the skin almost sagging as he stared right  past us. Then it contorted from a mixture of concentration and  puzzlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik and I just stood there, about to run, but Mr. Mann didn’t move  at all and said nothing. It was as if he’d stopped and forgot how to  function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We inched past him, afraid he’d reach out for us, but he didn’t move, didn’t even speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d already crossed half the hallway when we he spoke again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“... The Roman Empire started an invasion,” he continued on, reciting his lecture as he vanished down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dude,” Erik pressed out, staring after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No clue, maybe he’s broken or something?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik said nothing, but I saw him shudder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few more seconds, we reached the end of the hallway and the  starting point of the construction area. Materials and tools had been  placed haphazardly next to the sturdy metal door that led to the west  wing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw a small figure standing near the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kim,” I called out in a hushed whisper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave us a short nod, and Erik and I hurried towards her. For a  moment, she looked at us before she focused on the heavy metal door  ahead. Right behind it was the principal’s office, the only room in the  west wing that was still in use these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dammit Kim, let’s get out of here! What the hell were you thinking?!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need evidence,” she said in a low voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned towards her. How could she be so calm in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shit! It won’t open!” Erik cursed in a low voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched as he pushed himself against the heavy door while twisting the handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dude, it’s not moving! We should-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His eyes grew wide, and he broke up, staring at something behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned, I saw a tall figure standing behind Kim. Terror flooded over me when I noticed the twisted face of Mrs. Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kim, watch out!” I called out, but the small Asian girl didn’t move  at all. I took one step forward, but stopped when I could make out her  face for the first time. It was devoid of any emotion, her eyes empty,  and her mouth hanging half-open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hands dropped to my side, and my legs almost gave way as all  strength left my body. That wasn’t Kim, I realized. We’d been had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to think. When was the last time I’d spoken to her face to  face? When had I last seen her? Yesterday? The day before? God, how long  ago had they taken her? They must’ve noticed that I’d texted with her  and used that to lure me here. How the hell had I not thought about  that? How the hell could I’ve been that stupid!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Wolf stepped right past Kim, and with two more enormous steps,  she stood right in front of me. She was huge, had become a hulking,  twisted abomination, even worse than the one Mrs. Thomas had turned  into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to help you, Steven,” the creature said in a mocking, distorted voice of my homeroom teacher’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her huge hands reached out for me, but right at that moment, Erik’s backpack hit her straight in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell’s that thing!?” Erik screamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got to get away from,” he screamed, but his voice was cut off  when one of Mrs. Wolf’s giant hands closed around his head. She yanked  him back, holding him up like a child would a doll. He dangled from her  grip, beating against the elongated arm of the creature, but Mrs. Wolf  didn’t even to notice. She pushed her head forward, bringing it right in  front of Erik’s and started giggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was frozen, staring at the horrific creature in front of me. My  consciousness was pushed back, and my survival instincts took over. I  turned away, started running, but I’d barely taken a step when something  jumped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Kim! She was right on top of me, pushing me to the ground. I  twisted, struggled, and clawed at her, but it had no effect. I should’ve  been able to push her off, but the girl’s small body was much stronger  than should’ve been possible. For a few more moments, I struggled before  she restrained me. There was nothing I could do, nothing but look at  Mrs. Wolf and Erik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was still holding him in her grasp as she stepped forward towards  the heavy, sturdy metal door. With her one remaining hand, she pushed  it open as if it took no effort at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should’ve been a hallway behind that door. I knew the school building continued on, construction or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I saw instead was something else, something I didn’t understand.  It was shifting and pushing itself around in the darkness ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was flesh, liquid, gooey flesh, a giant pulsating thing, no, a  giant mess of flesh that filled out the entire hallway. I stared at it  in utter disbelief and terror. In the darkness, I thought I saw pores  and gashes open and close on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mouth hung open, and a short laugh escaped me as my sanity slipped  away. I felt something, a hand, cover my mouth, but I didn’t even  react. Instead, I stared at the unbelievable, surrealistic horror in  front of me. My mind had stopped working and was nothing but a blank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mrs. Wolf pushed her giant hand into one of the crevices on the thing’s surface, it glowed in a low purplish light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched as something pushed itself outward. There was a head, then  an upper body, and I realized I was looking at the principal. I saw more  bodies, though, and faces, all below the surface in that gooey mass.  Limbs too, some moving, some twitching, others dangling lifelessly  before they were swallowed up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her other arm surged forward, throwing Erik at the principal. In an  instant, he opened his mouth, and countless, small, fleshy tentacles  erupted from it. More and more of them pushed from the unhinged jaw of  the principal. They entwined him like vines, searching and probing his  body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik screamed in pure terror, started tearing them off himself, but  there had to be hundreds of them. Moments later, one of them tore into  his body, and soon others followed. Erik’s mouth was still open, but  there were no more screams now. Instead, his body twitched and  convulsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d expected the thing to pull him forward and swallow him. Instead, I saw his body wither away as the tentacles sucked him dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I saw how something new formed below the fleshy  surface. At first, it was nothing but a twitching thing, but then I saw a  head, a body, then arms and legs. Moments later, I stared at a complete  replica of Erik’s face that pushed itself forward from the pulsating  mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard, no, almost felt a voice reverberating from around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“First ones were all wrong, not working. We learned. We improved. We are better now. Much better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure out who was speaking, but Mrs. Wolf’s mouth was  closed, and so was Kim’s. No, what I was hearing was the fleshy mess in  front of me, speaking from the dozens of faces incorporated inside of  its body. The organism was musing on, mocking me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik’s copy pushed itself outside from one of the many crevices and  slumped down to the floor. For a moment, the disgusting, wet body  twitched and shock itself as if it was learning how to function. Legs  began moving, then arms, and finally, its eyes opened. At first, nothing  but a click escaped the thing’s mouth before it spoke in a distorted  version of Erik’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey dude, hey dude, hey dude,” it repeated, testing its voice until  it seemed to have gotten it right. Then it picked up the clothes still  dangling from the withered, bony remains of my friend and put them on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right at this moment, I Kim’s weight on top of me shifted. I used all  my remaining strength and pushed myself upward. Escape was impossible,  but it gave me enough room to rip her hand from my mouth. It was only  for a moment, but at that moment, I screamed at the top of my lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was over after only a few seconds. She pushed me to the ground  once more and with such force that it sent my world spinning. For a  moment, my vision went dark before I was dragged forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik, no, his copy, was gone, but Mrs. Wolf was still there. The  creature pushed her twisted visage close to my face and grinned at me  before I heard footsteps from the staircase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Wolf’s face retreated as she twisted her head around to stare  down the hallway. Her body collapse into itself, and she returned to her  human form. In a second, she’d stepped towards the heavy metal door and  threw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now what’s going on over there? Is that you, Schmidt? Brandt? I know you’re there! I saw you get in and-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He broke up when he saw Kim, Mrs. Wolf, and me. I was still on the ground, twisting against Kim and trying to get free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Siegert, good to see you. This student snuck into the school to  cause havoc. You know who he is, right? When he saw me, he tried to  sneak up on me and attack me! We were lucky enough to restrain him!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old man stared at Mrs. Wolf and Kim in utter bewilderment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s the middle of the night. Why are you here, Mrs. Wolf? And why’s that girl here?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Should you be worried about those things? That boy here has been causing trouble for days now, so-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then let the boy speak, dammit! I haven’t gotten the slightest clue  what’s going on anymore. Hell, I saw Mr. Wolfram and Mr. Mann down  there. What’s up with all this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment, everyone was quiet, and no one moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Kim released me and jumped the old man. In confusion, he  screamed up, and with speed, no one thought possible, he pushed the girl  off himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell’s wrong with you!?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He screamed at her as he tried to restrain her. Kim was much stronger  than he’d expected, and in a moment, she got free and jumped him again,  going for his neck. In shock and surprise, he tore her off himself  again and threw her to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She came to a rest, her head twisted in a strange angle. I saw the disbelief on the old man’s face, then the panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, dammit, I didn’t mean to,” he said in a shaky voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was up again, rushed to his side, and pulled at his arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Siegert! We’ve got to get out of here! They will kill us!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment, he just stared at me before he got a grip of himself.  It was too late, though. Mrs. Wolf’s body twisted and changed, and in a  second, she was upon Mrs. Siegert. The old man could barely get a hold  of his radio. He screamed, called something indistinguishable into it  before Mrs. Wolf overpowered him and tore the device off him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mrs. Wolf threw the old man towards the heavy metal door, I ran  off. Pain shot through my whole body as I rushed down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned right, towards the front door, but I saw someone ahead of  me. It had to be one of the other teachers, or hell a student. They were  coming for me! In a panic, I turned right and entered one of the  classrooms. Windows, there are windows, I remembered. I reached one, and  as I twisted the handle, a thundering, twisted teacher entered the  room. The creature screamed up, but I was already on the windowsill and a  moment later outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landing pushed the air from my lungs, but I fought myself back to  my feet. I tasted blood in my mouth, my lungs were burning, and I  almost collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I stumbled onward and screamed at the top of my lungs, hoping to wake people asleep in the dorms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few more steps, I crashed to the ground, exhausted. I fought  myself back up and dragged myself forward. Out, I had to get out of  here. Each new step was a fight, each scream a tremendous effort. I saw  someone else rushing from the school behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, now, Steven, where are you going? Shouldn’t you be in your dorm room?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Mr. Wolfram, leisurely coming after me. I screamed again, and  by now, I saw lights turning on in one of the dorm buildings. Yes,  someone must’ve heard me, I thought. Please, oh god, please come  outside!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t see anyone, though, and after a few more steps, I fell to  the ground. This time I didn’t have the energy to go on anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few moments later, Mr. Wolfram reached me. A mocking grin distorted  his face as he stared down at me. With his massive hands, he pulled me  upwards. He was about to lead me, no, to drag me back towards the school  building when I heard the sounds of police sirens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wolfram let go of me when he saw a police car stopping at the get to the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two police officers unlocked the gate and entered the school  grounds. Alerted by the sirens, students streamed from the dorms, trying  to see what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The officers made their way towards Mr. Wolfram and me. I quickly  freed myself from the teacher’s hands and stumbled towards them. Just  before I reached them, I heard a voice from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now what brings you here tonight, officers?” a female voice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned around, my eyes grew wide. It was Mrs. Wolf. In tow  with her was the security guard Mr. Siegert, or a copy of him, I  thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Siegert, what’s the problem here? You tried to contact us via the  radio, but all we heard was chaos,” one of the officers spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was a break-in at the school building. I thought it might have  been a trespasser and was going to call for backup, but this thing  here,” he pointed at his radio, “started malfunctioning. Turns out, it  was this boy here, trying to cause some trouble. Sorry, you made the  trip all the way here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, guess that’s it. You better get that radio of yours fixed. All  we heard was a distortion. It sounded like someone was screaming. You  want us to take the boy in?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, it wasn’t anything serious. Guess he wanted to pull a prank on some of the teachers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No!” I screamed up with a cracking voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s something at the school! It’s some sort of monster, and they are killing people and-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, be quiet, Steven! Enough of your pranks already! This is not a game anymore!” Mrs. Wolf cut in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled towards the officer. “It’s true! They murdered my friend!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey man, let’s go back already, I don’t want to get into more trouble,” I heard Erik’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes grew wide as I stared at his copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You should listen to your friend, Steven,” Mr. Siegert chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police officers eyed me for a moment before they sighed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, we’ll be going. Next time you lie to an officer, there’ll be  consequences, boy. Now go back to sleep. You can handle the rest, right,  Siegert?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, no problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, don’t leave me. They will kill me, too. No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at them and watched as they turned around and walked back to  the police car. Mrs. Wolf and Mr. Siegert were already coming towards  me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, boy, time to get back,” Mr. Siegert said, and I felt a cold,  hard hand on my shoulder. His eyes were wide, his mouth twisted and  grinning. With each second, his fingers dug deeper into my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let go of me!” I screamed and threw myself forward. I rushed one of  the police officers and reached for his gun, but I didn’t get to touch  it. The man pushed me to the ground and restrained me in an instant,  twisting my arm behind my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You crazy, boy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck you, you piece of shit!” I screamed at him and spat in his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now you’ve done it,” he said, his face hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched as he took out his handcuffs and put them on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ve just earned yourself a night at the station,” he said in a hard voice as he pulled me upward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he said this, I smiled and grinned back at the gathered group of twisted beings and fakes behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, now, is this really necessary? He’s just a boy,” Mr. Siegert started again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This boy attacked a police officer and tried to take his gun. This is no damned prank anymore, Siegert!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but laugh when they pushed me into the police car.  They frowned, their faces contorted by a mixture of anger and confusion.  Yet, I couldn’t stop. I’d made it! I got away! The only thing that  mattered was that I was alive. I didn’t care about anything else. All I  could do was to laugh out of sheer relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they drove off, I could finally calm down and relaxed in the back of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now what the hell’s wrong with you, boy?” one of them asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could say anything, his colleague spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kid’s probably on drugs or something, no reason to talk to him right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he said this, he eyed me in the back of the car. When he saw my beaming expression, his frown deepened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the station, they lead me to a cell in the back. By now, I’d calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They opened the cuffs, set me down, and one of the officers took a seat opposite me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, what did you take, kid?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cop grinned. “We’ll have a blood test anyway, so you might as well come clean now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I swear, nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right, why the hell would you attack us and try to get a hand of officer Schuster’s gun?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment, I almost burst out about the thing in the west wing and  the copies of teachers and students, but I stopped myself. There was no  way they, or anyone else for the matter, would believe me. I had to be  smart about this. Think, Steven, think dammit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’d have murdered me if I didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who are they?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mrs. Wolf, the teacher and Mr. Siegert, the night guard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now tell me, boy, why’d they do something like that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think, Steven, think. The cop stared me down, his face growing  angrier by the second. He opened his mouth to say something, but before  he could, I spoke up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Drugs,” I almost yelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re hiding drugs at the school! I wasn’t able to sleep, so I  went out for a walk and saw Mrs. Wolf, Mr. Siegert, and the principal  enter the school. They had money and a package or something with them.  It looked weird, so I followed them. I heard them talk about drugs,  about the money they needed, and how they would sell ‘the stuff.’ When  they saw me, they-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was cut off as the man brought his fist down on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bullshit! Drugs? Are you fucking kidding me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His partner, who was standing outside, spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you trying to pull here, kid?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why do you think those teachers were there in the middle of the  night? Why do you think I’m all beaten up, and they said they’d handle  it by themselves? Why would I lie about something like that? No one  would believe me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hah, you’ve got that right,” the officer sitting opposite me said, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ll stay here for the night. Don’t cause any more trouble, you got that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, the two of them left the cell and locked it behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I laid down on the bed, I listened to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The hell kind of bullshit story was that?” of them asked the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No clue, kid’s crazy, all right, but there might be something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“God dammit Robert, you think there’s something to the kid’s story?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nah, doubt it, but something about his story rubbed me the wrong way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they walked off, their voices faded, and I wasn’t able to make out what they said anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only I lay down on the bed I felt the pain all over my body and  noticed the countless bruises. I didn’t get to think about them much  because I fell asleep instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up when someone in front of the cell yelled my name. I opened  my eyes and pushed myself up. After blinking a few times, I recognized  the figure. It was dad, and he was furious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Couldn’t believe it when they called me! Thought it was some kind of  joke, but here you are, Steven. This time you’ve outdone yourself!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dad! What are you doing here?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, dammit? They called me right in the morning,  telling me my son’s locked up here! Because he attacked a police officer  of all things. What the hell’s wrong with you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dad, there was-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Quiet! We’ll talk once we’re out of here!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An officer walked up next to him and opened the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, Mr. Schmidt, your son can leave for now. He’s still a minor,  but attacking an officer’s still no laughing matter. There will be  consequences for what he did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he said this, his eyes wandered from dad to me and back to him. Dad nodded and gave me an angry, frustrated stare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He led me from the station without saying another word, we made our way to his car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dad, I’m sorry,” I said as he started the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad didn’t react. Instead, he just stared ahead as he drove from the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled into my seat, thinking about how to explain to him what had happened. Well, or better, what I should tell him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My head wandered to the car’s clock, and I saw that it was already  past ten in the morning. I wondered if the police would investigate the  school. If they did, would it mean they’d find that thing, and it would  all be over? What the hell was that thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the events from last night replayed, and I shuddered. How could something like that be real?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple times I opened my mouth to tell dad what had happened, to tell him something, but I just couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only after we’d driven for a good ten minutes that I wondered where we were going. Our home was in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dad, aren’t we going home?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, he didn’t say a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dad, where are we going?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I noticed the street we were on and the direction we were going in. Don’t tell me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re going back to school, Steven,” dad answered matter-of-factly, still staring straight ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What!? No, we can’t! Dad, there’s something weird going on there, people are dying and-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I talked to the principal in person this morning, son. Nothing is going on there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I saw how his face distorted into a grin, and his eyes grew wider and wider with each passing moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear god, no. “Dad?” I brought out in a low voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing. His hands closed around the steering wheel as he sped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic washed over me again. No, I couldn’t go back there. In a  moment, I removed my seat belt and reached for the door. One of my dad’s  hands jerked over and pushed me back into my seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going back, son,” he said, and right away, I heard the  distortion in his voice. With an insane amount of strength he pushed me  back to the seat. When he turned towards me, his face had grown long,  changed into a twisted caricature of my dad’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled, tore at the hand and fingers, but I couldn’t get them  off me. I twisted my body, lifted my feet, and kicked the thing next to  me with all the force I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no reaction, no sound of pain, nothing. I did it again, a  third time, and finally, the hand released me to get a hold of my legs. I  screamed in pain as the creature twisted my legs, but this time I kept  struggling. I frantically tore at the car door, got it open for a  moment, but was pulled back in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the school coming up ahead. In an act of sheer desperation, I  could free one of my legs and kicked the steering wheel as hard as I  could. The thing’s one hand wasn’t enough to hold it steady. The car  swerved to the left and crashed against a small tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My head collided with the dashboard of the car. I saw stars, tasted  blood, and for a moment, my vision turned dark. As I drifted off, I  screamed at myself to stay awake and fought against the dark haze that  filled my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jerked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car wasn’t moving anymore. The thing next to me was though its  hand was still on my leg, twisting it, the fingers digging into skin and  flesh. I screamed and started beating against the hand that held on to  me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metal twisted and churn, and I saw that the creature broken and  trapped behind the steering wheel. Strange liquids were leaking from its  body. His mouth was wide open, and it let out a distorted scream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to beat down on the hand. Its fingers dug into my flesh  as I kept at it. Beating it again and again and finally something gave  way, and the mangled and broken fingers slip off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an instant, I opened the car door and pushed myself outside. I  fell to the ground and crawled a few paces before I felt safe enough to  catch my breath. The thing in the car was still moving, still trying to  break free, and once more, I heard the churning of meat. I knew it  wouldn’t be long. With its strength, it was only a matter of time before  it would get free. And, I knew it would come after me again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got to my feet, I saw the police cars in front of the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes!” I screamed up in excitement. They’d gone after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already saw a police officer approaching me. Others had turned  towards the accident, too. I started running, but then slowed down  before I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the man was walking was all wrong. The way the others did as  well. The faces that had turned towards me were devoid of all emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s the boy,” one of them said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran right away. I threw myself forward and rushed towards the  forest surrounding the school grounds. I didn’t turn, and I didn’t  listen. My body should’ve been in sheer pain, but I felt nothing. It had  to be the adrenalin, the shock, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the first trees, then I was between them, and then I ran  deeper into the forest. My vision got blurry again, but I pushed myself  on and on, past the dark silhouettes the trees had become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran until my legs gave way and I crashed to the forest floor. For  long moments I could do nothing but lay there before I pushed myself  back up and continued crawling forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From where I was, I saw a small ditch below a fallen tree. I clawed  at the ground with my remaining strength, pulled myself forward, and  eventually slid inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For long minutes I lay there, shaking with pain and exhaustion. I’d  have screamed up, but I didn’t even have the energy left to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how long it took me to move again. When I could, I turned my head slightly to look outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, there was nothing, but soon I saw that the police was searching for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They weren’t looking human at all, though. It looked as if someone  had put random limbs together into weird, twisted creatures. They were  moving faster, quicker than humans, I thought. Some were rushing  forward, jumping between trees. Others walked on all fours, almost like  primates. There were no words, all I could hear were strange, inhuman  clicking noises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hours, I lay there in that small ditch, and for hours the  clicking noises and sounds of movement were all around me. Multiple  times I thought they had left only for them to come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only once night descended, silence return to the forest, and I passed out from exhaustion and injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, my whole body was hurting. Pushing myself from the  small ditch was a painful ordeal. When I was out, I looked around, but I  did not understand where I was. I stumbled through the forest  haphazardly. It was by pure chance that I found a small hiking trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t care where I was going. I just wanted to get away as far  from here as possible. Away from the school and away from those damned  things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, I noticed that the trail led me up into the hills that surrounded the school. Good, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body was aching, and when I noticed a small resting area, I  approached it instantly. I sank down on a bench to catch my breath but  forced myself not to lie down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to realize how far I’d made it. From where I was, I  could look over the area below. I saw the hills, the road, the distant  town and the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I scanned it, I saw the strange purplish hue coming from the west  wing. I could see the scaffold moving. No, I realized, it wasn’t the  scaffold, it was the thing below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I saw the many holes and burrows in the  construction area. I wondered why they were there, but soon I knew. That  thing, they must’ve come upon it during their construction. By now,  there was no construction going on anymore, no there was an excavation.  They were laying this thing, whatever it was, bare so it could free  itself from the ground. I saw countless dark figures moving around the  area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I watched them, the sun dawned, and I noticed the handful of buses that had arrived in front of the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw groups of students leaving the dorms and lining up next to  them. I couldn’t be sure, but from a distance, it seemed as if they were  all still, diligently waiting to get on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The field trips. Oh, god, all those students, I thought. They were all copies, all part of this thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d thought those field trips were nothing but a ploy or a trick to  get rid of anyone who’d figured out what was going on, but they were  actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I realized why. To spread it. To get this thing or parts of it  out of here. So it could get to universities and other schools nearby.  So it could learn, could spread and create new clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tore myself from the view and continued on, following the various  hiking tracks of the area. It must’ve been hours before I made it to a  normal road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have a clear plan, hell, I didn’t even have an idea. All I could do was walk on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was by sheer chance that I stumbled upon a small roadside diner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner stared at me in a mixture of confusion and worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You all right, boy? Need me to call you an ambulance?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at him, probing his face and his behavior, but the mixture of emotions on his face told me he had to be normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My phone, I need to charge it. I’ve got to call my parents,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man nodded, and after a while, he handed me a charger and pointed me towards a power outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my phone charged, I started writing this. I left soon after. I’ve been on my way for days now, writing this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to find help and thought about going to the police. But  wherever I go, I see the same emotionless faces, the same empty eyes and  hear the same monotonous voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do anymore. There’s no way I can stop this, no  way I could do anything. So please, if you read this, be careful where  you go and who you talk to. If you notice anything, inform the  authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an invasion underway. And there’s one thing I know. The  further this thing spreads, the more it learns, and the more it will  know how to act like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by now, it might already be too late. By now, these things might very well be indiscernible from normal humans.&lt;/p&gt;

He lead me to his room in some trashy apartment building. He fumbled with his keys a bit and opened the door, then stepped backed welcoming me in. Whatever dude. 

His apartment was almost completely empty, minus a fridge, a bed, and a tub of rat poison sitting in the middle of the room. 

""Got a rat problem, bud?"" 

""Sort of"" he mumbled. 

Wasn't really looking forward to getting poisoned. 

Despite it being mid July, and him sweating like a pig, it was impossibly cold in that room. No air conditioning in sight, and a fan that barely held on to the ceiling. 

I was shivering it was so cold. I could see my fucking breath. I looked around for a thermostat, he was off ""getting ready"" in the side room so I had some time to spare. I didn't want to look like a creep, don't really think he cared though. 

I didn't find a thermostat, but I did find that the rat poison bucket was empty, for some reason. Despite being creepy and cold, his place was actually kind of clean. Like he had just moved in. 

I'm not going to describe what he came out of that bedroom wearing, it doesn't really add anything. But he left his door slightly propped open, and that crazy shit is worth discussing. Dead rats, everywhere. Plastered across the walls like twisted murals, there eyes looked straight at me. 

Come closer, join us. 

That's it, I had enough. Not worth it, I can skip out on drinks for a few days. 

""Sorry, I have to leave.""

""What, why?"" Do you really have to pry. 

""I just realized I have to go do something, i won't charge you."" 

And I just saw your room full of dead rats, creep. 

""I have more money, I can pay you more if you stay."" 

Please somebody just save me from this. 

And that's when we heard it, a knock on the door. Completely innocent and normal, but to me it was a saviour. He got up to go open the door, as I contemplated escaping through the window. From my spot on the couch I could only see the back of the guys head as he opened the door, nothing past it. 

Please be the police or something.

He just stood at the door, not moving. His bullshit costume swayed in the wind. 

Sometimes, in the wind of change, we find our true direction. 

I got up too look past him, I wish I hadn't. A rat stood at the door, impossibly tall. Its body was humanoid, but covered in wet, matted grey hair. It's head was a twist of features, eyes were white and silky; gnarly hairs covered his face. What scared me the most was his claws, the size of knives and caked in garbage. 

""I see you have guests, sweet child."" 

I stood awkwardly in the doorway. 

The rat sighed. ""Madam if you could step out for a moment, I have business to take care of. I'll be with you in a moment."" 

I walked past them, the guy looked into my eyes for a split second as I passed him. 

Don't go, stay with me, his eyes said. The rat shut the door, and I ran. Ran as fast as  I could to get out of that disgusting place. 

I stood at a bus stop, ten minutes untill the next ride. Great. Might as well sit down, I thought. A herd of rats scurried past me, all squeaking and yelling in their rat language. Almost if they were celebrating. 

 Where. Am. I. 

I got out my phone, the clock read 12:40. 

How long was I in there?

I quickly texted mom my location, just in case. 

I love you mom, rememeber that forever

Just as the bus rounded the corner, the clouds parted and let a completely red moon shine through. Maybe I'm dreaming, if that explains it. The doors to the bus opened, and to my surprise that fucking rat was driving. 

""Hello sweet child, I told you I would be with you in a moment. Didn't know you were so eager to leave, don't you want to talk with Papa rat?"" 

I stared at him. 

""Just take me home."" 

He let out a long laugh, more like a shriek than anything else. After around ten seconds of laughing his head off, he started choking. Deep, ugly choking. Right when I though he was about to tip over and die, he spit up a finger. Nice. 

""Thanks for helping me,"" he said.

 ""I'll get you home one way or another, but you gotta get on first."" He let out a smile that made my skin crawl. Without saying anything, I boarded the rat bus. If I could, I would have gone to the very back seat, as far away from that thing as possible, but all the seats except for the one right behind the driver were full. Not with people, or rats. But dark shadow figures, almost on the shape of people, but not quite right. I couldn't see their eyes, but I could feel them. 

You'll be safe here, just like us. 

I didn't want to be on that bus anymore.

With a long, high scream the rat slammed his dirty foot on the pedal. I slammed against the back of the seat, I felt like I was in a plane, just much faster. Actually, way faster. I couldn't even see out the windows, everything was a blurr. Even the fastest rollercoasters I've went on didn't feel like this. The rat was still screaming and yelling, just having the time of his life, when I realized the bus was moving upward, not forward. 

What is this place.

After a few minutes of ascending, we finally leveled out. 

""I feel like I'm gonna throw up something big!"" The rat shouted, followed by more ugly laughing. 

I looked out the window, stars were above us, and an ocean below. I lived in Colorado at the time, no ocean for a few hundred miles. 

""So sweet child, got any questions? Most others like you are already screaming about a bunch of nonsense. Talking rats and such. Never makes any sense."" He chuckled. 

""I've seen worse."" 

He looked back at me, frowned, then switched the bus off. Immediately we started falling through the sky, all while he screamed and yelled and laughed, even greater and larger than he had before. I held on to the seat as hard as I could, but my hands were slipping. My heart was beating out of my chest, everything was spinning. All while the rat shrieked in my ear. And then, it stopped. Everything was back to normal, we weren't falling towards the ocean and I wasn't about to have a heart attack. The rat sat in his chair, like nothing happened. 

""Sorry about that Sweety, I just got really bored all of the sudden. You gotta give me something or else I'll do that again. I'm about to change your life after all."" He winked his crusty eyes at me. 

""Ok,"" I said. ""Who are you, where did you come from? I've never seen a huge, talking rat before."" 

""Glad you asked, sweetheart. I'm the Rat King. When a bunch of rats get stuck together somehow, maybe their tails get tied together or something sticky attaches them, they come together to make a rat king. I'm just special because I absorbed all the other rats, now I'm magic."" He winked again. 

""Ok well I'm really wondering where we are right now, if you can tell me that."" I said.

""Stop!"" He shouted as he slammed on the brakes. 

""We're here, don't got time for talking anyway my throat is already completely parched. You ask too much questions, if you want to survive out here then you should learn to keep quite."" 

What does that even mean? 

""Stay inside, I got to take care of something."" 

He hopped off the seat and opened the bus door. 

""Don't open the door for anyone, there's a bunch of creeps out here."" 

""In the middle of the ocean, miles above the water?"" I asked. He ignored me. 

He walked out the door, and I expected him to fall through the air, but somehow he was able to walk on it. He stretched his rat arms and yawned, then he began coughing. I felt the vibrations of his fit through the closed bus door. I looked back at the shadow people, they weren't as dark as when I got on first. Like they were fading away. The one behind me was whispering something, too quite for me to hear. 

The Rat king began banging on the bus, still coughing violently. Something was coming up. A bright red beer bottle made it's way out of his throat, it got stuck when it was halfway out, then he finished the job by ripping out with his hands. He jumped and danced around in celebration, I couldn't hear through the walls, but I imagined he was laughing and going crazy. Everything was just so funny to him.

Finally, the jumping ceased and he took the cap off the bottle, dumped it out into the open air, of course the red liquid fell through the air while the rat didn't, then when the liquid had all flown through he smashed the bottle on his head. I felt like I had just experienced a bizarre ritual of sorts, although the shadow people weren't bothered. Maybe it wasn't so strange, I don't really know anymore. 

After he poured out the bottle, there was a big flash of light, and when the light went away we were no longer over the ocean. Instead, the bus was now in the parking lot of a gas station. I think. None of the signs had letters I recognized, all of them were what looked like random scribbles. The rat was gone, he must have gone into the gas station. 

Nothing seemed right at the gas station. The shadow people were all over the place, except they were as dark as coal. The shadows in the bus were almost completely faded away. Hundreds of moths crawled all over their heads, only leaving holes for where the eyes should have been. 

Instead of gas tanks, huge purple elephants walked around giving each car gas. Baby dolls with no eyes or clothes rode on top of the elephants, steering them. One of the elephants came over to the bus, the baby on top jumped off. Like a balloon, it grew to the size of the bus and smiled. He peered in through the windows, and looked me straight in the eyes. 

You cant hide forever. 

I looked away and covered my face. Just go away. I can't take it anymore. 

I heard the baby started crying, long, painful wails that shook my head. He started banging on the window.

""Let me in!"" He shouted while sobbing.

The windows were going to break. With each bang, I heard cracks spring through the vehicle. Maybe if the baby caught me I could finally leave this place. 

When confronted with failure, the best thing to do is keep trying. 

""Stop."" I whispered. The banging stopped. 

With confidence I didn't recognize as my own, I turned my head to look at the baby. Now I looked straight into it's eyes. 

Don't make me come out there.

The baby's body shrunk back to normal as he went limp. I ran to the window and looked down, it's eyes closed like it was sleeping. Not so big anymore. The elephant walked over to the baby and sucked it into his trunk.

""Don't hold it against him."" The elephant said, words not spoken but transmitted. The elephant spoke in my head. I held my hand to the window.

I'll see you again soon.

""Goodbye."" It whispered, and faded away to nothing.

**

The rat was back. 

""Sorry about that, hope you didn't have too much trouble. Even rats need bathroom breaks!"" 

I glared at him. He looked back. My eyes said it all, and after the most relaxing takeoff in my life, we were back in the air. Now over an endless desert.

""Take me home rat, I'm done playing your game."" I said. 

""Interesting that you think that going home is worth it. I can assure you staying with me is your best option right now.""

""Why, what are going do for me?"" 

""Its a secret. I'm the Rat king, the magic rat, I can do anything I want. Just wait.""

""Please just take me home.""

He looked back at me.

""Rude."" He scolded. 

Then he switched a few buttons, and before I could say anything I blacked out.

When faced with a world of eternal darkness, I'm sure you would wish God was on your side. 

**

I awoke in a damp room. Dark and musty, it looked like a sewer to me. Strange symbols were plastered all over the walls, most of rats. I could hear laughter from faraway, a locked metal door blocked me from the rest of the sewer. No other exits were present, I was trapped. 

A small rat stood still in the corner. His eyes were completely white, I'm guessing he was blind. Despite that, his eyes followed my every move.

""Hello?"" I asked. 

He stayed still.

""Excuse me, do you know a way out of here?"" 

Then he held out his hand, something was in it. He held it out, a peppermint. 

""Do I eat this?"" I asked.

He stayed still, eyes looking past me. His mind was somewhere else. Whatever I thought. I plopped it in my mouth, and blacked out again. 

**

""Good morning sweet child, you scheduled an appointment?"" 

My eyes jolted open. The rat sat in an old dirty arm chair. His body was covered in garbage, various liquids soaked his matted fur and dirt stuck to it. 

 I was tied to a wooden chair in the middle of the room. We were somewhere else in the sewer, now a bigger room. I looked around, hundreds of rats surrounded us. All of their tiny eyes were fixed on us, completely silent and watching. 

""Where am I? What is going on?"" I mumbled, still somewhat asleep. 

""You're in the room of dreams!"" The rat said. And with that, all of the rats around us erupted in cheering. They jumped and clapped around us, untill the rat king held up his hand and they all stopped. 

""They get excited over this kind of thing, you should be too."" He said. 

When I didn't say anything, he frowned. 

""Listen, I can give you whatever you want. I'm the rat king. Thousands of years old, all knowing, all powerful. In ways you won't understand because you aren't a rat, you helped me find enemy.""

""Who?"" I asked. 

""Your client, the guy with the room full of rats, remember?"" He replied. 

""Oh."" 

""God. Listen here sweet child. I'll give you one wish, anything you want. It's the least I can do."" 

""Anything?"" I asked.

""Anything."" 

""I don't know what to wish for.""

He stared at me. With a glare that cut right through me, he stared. The rats around us all scurried away, deep into the depths of the sewer. They were scared. 

""What?!"" He screamed. With astounding strength, he stood up and threw his chair across the room. 

""I offer you anything and you say that?! Listen here, I know you. Everything about you. Parents divorced at age seven, dad killed himself when you were nine. Let you discover it yourself too. Bet it was the worst morning of your life. Now you sell your body to weak men because it's the only thing you think you are good enough to do. But you're strong. Unlike your client, who killed rats of all things because it made him feel special, you are strong. I saw that baby screaming at you. Not anybody can stand up to that think like that.""

Tears went down my face. 

""I can make you a kid again. Give you a life where your parents never broke up, where your dad never killed himself. I can't guarantee you won't end up the same, but I'm sure you'll find solace in knowing that at least it was meant to be.""

""Am I dead?"" I asked. My shirt was soaked. 

""Believe what you want, I'm not going to ruin this story for you. Live how you want to, don't let anyone stop you from doing that.""

He looked into my eyes. 

""What do you say?"" 

""Yes. A thousand times yes.""

And with that, a light flashed. 

I woke in my childhood bed.

The sun was shining through the curtains. 

And a rat plush sat in front of me.

Good luck.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;Who are you, where did you come from? I&amp;#39;ve never seen a huge, talking rat before.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cant hide forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked away and covered my face. Just go away. I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard the baby started crying, long, painful wails that shook my head. He started banging on the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let me in!&amp;quot; He shouted while sobbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The windows were going to break. With each bang, I heard cracks spring through the vehicle. Maybe if the baby caught me I could finally leave this place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When confronted with failure, the best thing to do is keep trying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop.&amp;quot; I whispered. The banging stopped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With confidence I didn&amp;#39;t recognize as my own, I turned my head to look at the baby. Now I looked straight into it&amp;#39;s eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make me come out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baby&amp;#39;s body shrunk back to normal as he went limp. I ran to the window and looked down, it&amp;#39;s eyes closed like it was sleeping. Not so big anymore. The elephant walked over to the baby and sucked it into his trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t hold it against him.&amp;quot; The elephant said, words not spoken but transmitted. The elephant spoke in my head. I held my hand to the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll see you again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goodbye.&amp;quot; It whispered, and faded away to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rat was back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry about that, hope you didn&amp;#39;t have too much trouble. Even rats need bathroom breaks!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glared at him. He looked back. My eyes said it all, and after the most relaxing takeoff in my life, we were back in the air. Now over an endless desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Take me home rat, I&amp;#39;m done playing your game.&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Interesting that you think that going home is worth it. I can assure you staying with me is your best option right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why, what are going do for me?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Its a secret. I&amp;#39;m the Rat king, the magic rat, I can do anything I want. Just wait.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please just take me home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked back at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rude.&amp;quot; He scolded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he switched a few buttons, and before I could say anything I blacked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with a world of eternal darkness, I&amp;#39;m sure you would wish God was on your side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awoke in a damp room. Dark and musty, it looked like a sewer to me. Strange symbols were plastered all over the walls, most of rats. I could hear laughter from faraway, a locked metal door blocked me from the rest of the sewer. No other exits were present, I was trapped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small rat stood still in the corner. His eyes were completely white, I&amp;#39;m guessing he was blind. Despite that, his eyes followed my every move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stayed still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excuse me, do you know a way out of here?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he held out his hand, something was in it. He held it out, a peppermint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do I eat this?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stayed still, eyes looking past me. His mind was somewhere else. Whatever I thought. I plopped it in my mouth, and blacked out again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning sweet child, you scheduled an appointment?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes jolted open. The rat sat in an old dirty arm chair. His body was covered in garbage, various liquids soaked his matted fur and dirt stuck to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was tied to a wooden chair in the middle of the room. We were somewhere else in the sewer, now a bigger room. I looked around, hundreds of rats surrounded us. All of their tiny eyes were fixed on us, completely silent and watching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where am I? What is going on?&amp;quot; I mumbled, still somewhat asleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re in the room of dreams!&amp;quot; The rat said. And with that, all of the rats around us erupted in cheering. They jumped and clapped around us, untill the rat king held up his hand and they all stopped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They get excited over this kind of thing, you should be too.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I didn&amp;#39;t say anything, he frowned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Listen, I can give you whatever you want. I&amp;#39;m the rat king. Thousands of years old, all knowing, all powerful. In ways you won&amp;#39;t understand because you aren&amp;#39;t a rat, you helped me find enemy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your client, the guy with the room full of rats, remember?&amp;quot; He replied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God. Listen here sweet child. I&amp;#39;ll give you one wish, anything you want. It&amp;#39;s the least I can do.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what to wish for.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stared at me. With a glare that cut right through me, he stared. The rats around us all scurried away, deep into the depths of the sewer. They were scared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?!&amp;quot; He screamed. With astounding strength, he stood up and threw his chair across the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I offer you anything and you say that?! Listen here, I know you. Everything about you. Parents divorced at age seven, dad killed himself when you were nine. Let you discover it yourself too. Bet it was the worst morning of your life. Now you sell your body to weak men because it&amp;#39;s the only thing you think you are good enough to do. But you&amp;#39;re strong. Unlike your client, who killed rats of all things because it made him feel special, you are strong. I saw that baby screaming at you. Not anybody can stand up to that think like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tears went down my face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can make you a kid again. Give you a life where your parents never broke up, where your dad never killed himself. I can&amp;#39;t guarantee you won&amp;#39;t end up the same, but I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll find solace in knowing that at least it was meant to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Am I dead?&amp;quot; I asked. My shirt was soaked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Believe what you want, I&amp;#39;m not going to ruin this story for you. Live how you want to, don&amp;#39;t let anyone stop you from doing that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked into my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you say?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes. A thousand times yes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, a light flashed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke in my childhood bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was shining through the curtains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a rat plush sat in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

I get in bed, and sleep for a few hours until he comes home. I woke up when I felt the bed shake lightly around me as he got in. I heard the sheets rustle and he tucked them around himself. He cuddled up next to me and wrapped one arm around me from behind and one under my pillow. “Hey baby.” I said sleepily, not moving or even opening my eyes to not wake my body back up.

I giggled quietly and moved his hand around my waist, to my mouth so I could kiss it. “Not tonight Logan, I have to go into work early tomorrow.” I said coyly. He ran his hand through my hair and kissed me more. I smiled to myself, enjoying the company of my love with me. Moments like these are the ones I look forward to every day.

We laid there and I let him stroke and twirl my hair, blissfully wrapped in this moment with him. My phone vibrated under my pillow. I groaned as I pulled it out. I tried using as little energy as possible to answer it, moving only the muscles in my hand to tap roughly where the answer button should be, bring the phone to my ear, and my mouth to answer with a weak ‘hello?” in a slightly annoyed tone. It’s too late to be calling anyone on a weeknight unless it were some sort of emergency. 

“Hey babe, it’s me. The boys need me to stay a few hours late, So you’ll probably be asleep by the time I’m home. I just wanted to say goodnight and I love you, and remind you to lock there door, there have been a few break-ins.”

My eyes shot open instantly and my body became stiff and cold. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t think. Could he hear who was on the line? Could he sense the fear i suddenly felt?

He squeezed tighter and tighter, until I couldn’t breathe. I kicked and thrashed about to try and get him off me, nothing worked. I turned to face him. Light green eyes stared back at me with a snaggle toothed smile stretched over his face like a banner. He laughed wildly and kissed my neck again and bit my ear, but did it harder. He squeezed tighter and tighter, I was going to pass out, I knew it. His face was the last thing I saw before I passed out. 

I woke up, at 4:30 am. I was panting and in a cold sweat, tears running down my face. I looked at the clock, then next to me. My husband lays there peacefully. I rubbed his back and he smiled in his sleep. I catch my breath knowing this was all a terrible dream. I sigh in relief and get up to go to the bathroom. 

I go to the sink and splash water on my face. I look at the panicked woman in my reflection and I notice something. Blood on my neck, coming from bite marks on my ear. I staggered back in fear.

He stood right in the middle of the road very oblivious to his surroundings in my opinion. I didn't really care if some weirdo stood in the middle of the road but everyday he seemed to get closer. And as he got closer he gained more characteristics.

 He had no face yet a very blank stare. No color on his person whatsoever. Black and White like an old TV. He wore a T-shirt and jeans but the T-shirt had two distinct stains on it.

,nosleep,"I woke up this morning with an email. I'm very unsettled by it. And I'm not sure whether or not I should go to the police.

Maybe the people here could give me some advice?

\-----------------------------------------------

When I signed up, I wasn't really sure what to expect. Two weeks quarantine, an injection of a virus I knew nothing about. Endless consent signatures; some saying that I would be required to report any unusual symptoms. Several psychological examinations to make sure I could withstand two weeks of zero socialization.

In hindsight, I wish I'd known what I was really signing up for. Of course I didn't care, I had gambling debt up to my waist. I was a pre-med dropout who didn't want to be a doctor. If I didn't get seven thousand dollars in two weeks, I'd be a dead man either way.

The first day I was escorted into a small isolation room. It looked comfortable enough, I expected white walls and sterile surfaces. Instead I got a room that looked like something from a five star hotel.

The room was cozy, they even made sure there was a window with a view. They gave me a laptop, a notebook, several game consoles, and art supplies. They were clear that I wasn't allowed to keep any of it when I left, just for contamination purposes.

They let me acclimatize to the room. They wanted to make sure I could mentally handle being locked up. The first half of the day, I spent just lounging around, watching tv, or playing videogames. It was really shocking that they'd pay me several thousand dollars to do nothing.

A few hours into the first day, I heard a knock. Then the door unbolted itself, a man wearing a sterile suit walked in. His face disguised by the large hood he wore. The place where is mouth should've been was covered by a breather.

He walked to the bed and sat a case down on top of it. The case clicked as it was opened. The hooded man pulled a syringe from the case, putting it together piece by piece; forming an auto injector.

He told me that the test would begin, and I'd be injected with NOX-9. Just as the injector was placed against my skin, on the inside of my forearm; that's when I noticed the men who came in behind the suited person. They wore riot gear. This unsettled me, but I couldn't put my finger on why. Was I going to be a risk to them? Were they afraid of people who had been locked up in a form of solitary confinement?

I didn't know. I didn't care, I was getting paid.

The auto-injector made a loud metal clink, and I felt a sharp sting. After which, they all left me to my fate.

The first symptoms of NOX-9 appeared about two days later. First was the urge to hoard toilet paper. It was disturbing, I couldn't get a grip on how much I obsessed over it. The image of sitting on the toilet, reaching for paper; and finding nothing. Eventually it started to haunt my dreams. I'd see giant rolls of toilet paper, mocking me.

I stopped thinking about the money I was going to receive.

By the fourth day, I was constantly clutching a roll of loo roll in my arms. By the tenth day, I had run out of them. Seemingly, no one had given me any more; the slot my meals were pushed through, didn't surface any toilet paper.

Before I tell you what happens next. You mustn't judge me. Alright? I'm not sure if it was whatever I'd been injected with; or just some latent mental disorder.

But that's when the strangest urge gripped me. I started having these horrible thoughts about tearing off my own skin. Drying it. Wrapping it around the discarded rolls. At first I just took a little from the top of my thigh. It hurt, but not as much as the urges I was having. I told myself that I wouldn't do it again, no sane person would ever do something like this.

But it felt...good. All of the thoughts I was having, the fears, disappeared like a fog.

I started to crave it again. I missed the feeling that it brought me. That feeling of comfort, of being in a metaphorical womb. Sheltered from all of the horrific nightmares, the obsessions I'd been having over such a stupid thing.

I just couldn't stop myself.

By the thirteenth day, I was missing most of the skin from my thighs. It was strange though. I didn't bleed, I didn't hurt. I felt, free. I'm not sure what felt free of. But the compulsion to hoard, and the one to create toilet paper; was replaced.

It's been a month since the psychological examinations. Since all of the therapy. I tried my best to lie, to fake being better. Just so they would release me. And here I am, finally back home. But...I'm not me anymore. I've been irreversibly changed. I've become more than I was.

After a few weeks back at home, I've run out of skin to remove. And I feel completely free, euphoric actually.

I don't fear anything anymore.

I only wish I could share this gift, with you my humble reader. And cure you of that terrible sickness.

Sincerely,

I&amp;#39;m very unsettled by it. And I&amp;#39;m not sure whether or not I should go to the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the people here could give me some advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I signed up, I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure what to expect. Two weeks quarantine, an injection of a virus I knew nothing about. Endless consent signatures; some saying that I would be required to report any unusual symptoms. Several psychological examinations to make sure I could withstand two weeks of zero socialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I wish I&amp;#39;d known what I was really signing up for. Of course I didn&amp;#39;t care, I had gambling debt up to my waist. I was a pre-med dropout who didn&amp;#39;t want to be a doctor. If I didn&amp;#39;t get seven thousand dollars in two weeks, I&amp;#39;d be a dead man either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day I was escorted into a small isolation room. It looked comfortable enough, I expected white walls and sterile surfaces. Instead I got a room that looked like something from a five star hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room was cozy, they even made sure there was a window with a view. They gave me a laptop, a notebook, several game consoles, and art supplies. They were clear that I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to keep any of it when I left, just for contamination purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They let me acclimatize to the room. They wanted to make sure I could mentally handle being locked up. The first half of the day, I spent just lounging around, watching tv, or playing videogames. It was really shocking that they&amp;#39;d pay me several thousand dollars to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few hours into the first day, I heard a knock. Then the door unbolted itself, a man wearing a sterile suit walked in. His face disguised by the large hood he wore. The place where is mouth should&amp;#39;ve been was covered by a breather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He walked to the bed and sat a case down on top of it. The case clicked as it was opened. The hooded man pulled a syringe from the case, putting it together piece by piece; forming an auto injector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me that the test would begin, and I&amp;#39;d be injected with NOX-9. Just as the injector was placed against my skin, on the inside of my forearm; that&amp;#39;s when I noticed the men who came in behind the suited person. They wore riot gear. This unsettled me, but I couldn&amp;#39;t put my finger on why. Was I going to be a risk to them? Were they afraid of people who had been locked up in a form of solitary confinement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know. I didn&amp;#39;t care, I was getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auto-injector made a loud metal clink, and I felt a sharp sting. After which, they all left me to my fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first symptoms of NOX-9 appeared about two days later. First was the urge to hoard toilet paper. It was disturbing, I couldn&amp;#39;t get a grip on how much I obsessed over it. The image of sitting on the toilet, reaching for paper; and finding nothing. Eventually it started to haunt my dreams. I&amp;#39;d see giant rolls of toilet paper, mocking me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped thinking about the money I was going to receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the fourth day, I was constantly clutching a roll of loo roll in my arms. By the tenth day, I had run out of them. Seemingly, no one had given me any more; the slot my meals were pushed through, didn&amp;#39;t surface any toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I don't know how I got here nor exactly where I am. I woke up in a cell filled with old blood stains. The scent and sight is sickening me. There's also a strange rotting *corpses* scent lingering in the air. All I know is that some weird stuff has happened.

As I woke up with no memory of previous events in the cell, I saw someone. A slender lady with pale skin and red eyes peering over my bedside. I looked around, feeling confused and dazed. As if I've been drugged. I noticed someone else in a bed on the other side of the small cell, my friend. I will not state his name but I'll call him Zach. He was still sound asleep. The pale woman smiled happily as she noticed my awakening, ""Good morning, Charlie! Glad to see you're awake.""

""How do you know my name? Who are you?!""

""You've gone insane, ma'am. Now, now. Don't worry, you'll be in right shape quite soon!""

I was beyond confusion. I haven't gone insane? Why was both my friend and I in this cell with a vampire looking lady? She motioned for both of us to get up, ""You both must be starving, would you like me to lead you to the cafeteria for breakfast?""

Although skeptical, I decided to follow her and so did Zach. Zach chimed in ""What's for breakfast?"" as we were walking.

""Eggs."" She replied simply and evenly.

Zach and I looked at each other, frightened, as we passed various rooms filled with strange looking devices and furniture. A room filled with chambers of ice, a nurse's office, a room with boards over the metal door. What was going on?

After what felt like forever, we reached the cafeteria. We both got our food and sat down as the pale woman disappeared into a different room. A different woman, also pale with almost glowing green eyes, walked in and sat beside us. In a high-pitched voice, the lady chimed, ""Hello Zach and Charlie! I am Miss Amelia. Cause no trouble and you'll be fine.""

Then she just scampered off, smiling. What the fuck was happening?

After eating, I felt sick. Coughing violently. Zach hacked up his food, along with blood. We left the cafeteria, searching for a nurse. I was so confused still. Why was the staff so pale and frightening? Why as I so sick? Why are we here? Why were there no other people?

We eventually found it after finding a load of terrifying rooms. The nurse greeted us with a sickening grin, ""What brings you two here? You seem unwell.""

""We're both coughing violently, there's even some blood."" Zach managed to rasp.

""Well! How about you both lay down for a bit to rest? Rough first day I suppose."" She said so happily that it was *terrifying* considering the environment while directing us to the blood stained beds with straps.

We both laid down on two different beds. The nurse strapping us in, both of us frightened as she giggled while she did it. What. The. Hell? She skipped over to the cabinet and grabbed something. A syringe?

,nosleep,"So many of you may remember the [oh-so-romantic tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/aj81ml/my_sleep_paralysis_demon_saved_my_life/) of how I met my wonderful husband, Mark. We went into business together after he saved my life and have been working as hitmen for a few years now. 

Normally, the cases are pretty cut and dry. I’ll be honest with you, most of them are husbands or wives who pay us to kill off their spouse for either insurance money or because of infidelity. It honestly gets really annoying hearing the same old story over and over again. That’s why when I got the call from a phone booth in the middle of Alabama from a young woman, I figured this was no different.

“So I’m not really sure how to do this..” she started.

I rolled my eyes. It may be insensitive considering that this woman had probably never ordered a hit on someone before, but this was my life. Every day of my life. The same shit. 

“I need you to take care of someone for me.” she whispered into the phone, fear seeming to creep into her voice. Now I was intrigued. This woman was scared and that could mean a few things. Usually, it meant that she was a victim of some kind of abuse. 

“I need a name, address and bank account number” I said, not letting any emotion seep into my voice. It was easier to keep it plain and simple. Although the reason behind the hits usually came out, sometimes it was easier not to know. 

“I don’t have an address, exactly. But I can give you an area”

I rolled my eyes again. She doesn’t even have the information I need to make this as smooth as possible. We charge extra if we have to track them down. 

“His name is Joel Marteen. He usually shows up on north market street. Sometimes he walks down 4th street. Just depends on the day.”

I jotted this information down in my black notebook. “I need a description.”

I heard her take a deep breath on the other end and could hear a slight tremble. “He is about 6 foot 1. Maybe 200 pounds. Age is around 55 years old. Brown hair. Brown eyes. Tattoo under left eye.”

A big breath comes from the other end of the line. “Right side of his head is blown off.”

I stared at the phone momentarily. Did I hear that right? Was this some bullshit call? “Hey, if this is some bullshit call.. I swear to God, I will hunt you-”

“It’s not bullshit.”

“How can half his fucking head be gone?”

“My mother hired your partner to kill him around 10 years ago.”

“Well, he never fucks up.”

“Well he did.”

Blood began to pool in my face as I felt anger rise up in me. “Are you sure this is the same guy?”

“I think I know what my own fucking father looks like” she all but screamed. 

I pulled the phone away from my ear and took a deep breath. “Okay. I will consult with him. We require half the money now, half when the job is done. 2 separate accounts.”

“Okay.” And then the phone clicked and the call ended just as fast as it had started.

I set the phone down and took another deep breath, staring at the information I had written on the page in front of me: Joel Marteen, 55, should be dead already.

I stood and went into the kitchen to find Mark making pancakes while our daughters sat at the kitchen table, coloring pictures of princesses and unicorns. “Mommy, look!” Cecilia smiled as she held up her picture to proudly show me. Lilly held hers up as well, copying everything her big sister did.

I smiled, “wow, those are really pretty.” I walked over to Mark who planted a light kiss on my cheek. I leaned against him as he flipped over a pancake, “we’ve got an interesting one.” I said softly. 

Mark set the last pancake onto a plate and covered both stacks with syrup. He set a plate in front of each girl and kissed each on top of the head before retreating to our office. I followed quietly as our daughters dug into their breakfast.

Mark sat in his computer chair and looked up at me, “well?”

“Some young girl called from what I assume was a phone booth in Alabama. Number is not connected to any name.” 

Mark nodded, “okay..”

“She put a hit out on her father. Joel. 55 year old male. 6’1, brown hair, brown eyes.”

“Distinct markings?”

I chuckled slightly at this. “Yeah. Tattoo under left eye. No right side of face.”

My husband stared at me for a moment in disbelief. Then he stood up “okay. Ha ha. You got me.”

“I’m not joking. And I don’t think she was either.”

My husband rolled his eyes, “you can’t be serious?”

“She said that they had hired you a long time ago to do the hit.”

My husband looked at me, a bit of confusion in his eyes, “Joel?” I saw his eyes look up as he thought about his past and tried to recover any memories of this. 

“Joel Marteen.” I clarified. 

My husband immediately met my gaze. “What?”

“That’s his name. Marteen.”

My husband began shaking his head and chuckling slightly, “no way. This is just some bullshit prank call.”

“She seemed pretty serious.”

He looked at me again, looking for any hints of joking in my face. He must have found none because he continued, “I killed that man 10 years ago. I remember it very vividly.”

My husband sat back down and took a deep breath, “his wife ordered the hit on him. After years of abuse, she was tired of living that way. She suspected he had begun sexually abusing their 8 year old.”

“Jesus Christ.” I said softly. Cecilia was only 4, but I couldn’t imagine someone doing that to her. I didn’t even want to think about it.

“I shot him at point blank range in the head. He died almost instantly.”

“Well, clearly he didn’t. Because the girl is calling-”

“I checked his goddamn pulse, Renee. He was dead.”

I watched my husband for a moment before deciding to believe him. “Well, if he is dead then how the hell is he walking around? And this girl said he killed her mother. How did he do that if he’s dead?”

My husband set his head in his hands. “I don’t know.”

I took a deep breath and took his hand gently in mine. “Maybe we should just meet him. Not kill him?” 

My husband looked up at me, “are you insane? Meet the guy I killed?”

“Well, that’s up for debate still.”

Mark rolled his eyes, “I don’t know..”

“I think it’s the only thing we can do.”

Mark took another deep breath before slowly nodding his head. I was always right. 

The next day, we dropped the kids off at Mark’s parents’ house and loaded up the car. We weren’t sure if this was a hit or not because we really weren’t sure what we were dealing with. We started the long ride to Alabama, in near silence the entire way. Neither of us would say it, but we were both terrified of what we were about to encounter. 

We finally got to Alabama late the following night. We parked along the street with a clear view of north market street. We waited and waited, but never saw a man with half a face turn up. 

Instead, we saw a young woman, about 18 walk down the street. She looked around fearfully as she walked back towards a crummy apartment building. Something inside me just told me this was the girl who had called. We decided to follow her. 

We parked the car and I got out to confront her. I walked up to her and she immediately recognized my voice the second I called out to her. “It’s you.”

I nodded slowly, unsure of what to say next. She sighed softly and in a near whisper said, “follow me. Just you, not him.” I assumed she was referring to Mark. I looked back at the car and gave him the signal to wait. He seemed to want to argue my decision but I ultimately won and followed the young girl inside. 

We made our way up the stairs and into her small studio apartment. She sat down on her couch, tears already beginning to flow and motioned for me to sit in the chair across from her.

I cautiously sat down. “I don’t understand.. We watched for hours and never saw any-”

“I know.” She said abruptly. “Only I can see him.”

I began to shake my head, standing up to leave. This was just some psycho who was having some kind of mental break.   
“Please let me explain,” she begged.

I sat back down, watching her every move. I was unsure if I was in danger, but I didn’t want to take any chances.

“My mother called your partner to take care of my dad years ago. Their relationship wasn’t very good and sometimes things go physical. I hated that he sometimes hit her. But she hit him way more. I was so sick of the fighting and yelling. I just wanted them to break up and move on.”

I watched her face, trying to comprehend what this confession was about.

“I knew she wouldn’t leave on her own. So, I had to help her.”

I nodded slowly, “help her..?”

She took a deep breath, a few more tears falling. “I told her that he had been touching me.”

I bit my lip, hard, trying to hold back the words that wanted to pour out of my mouth. Lying about something like that was absolutely disgusting, even from an 8 year old. 

“I thought she’d just leave him,” she looked down at her lap, “I didn’t know she’d have him killed.”

“Well, that’s a pretty fucked up thing. I’d kill anyone I thought did that to my kids.”

She nodded, more tears falling, sniffling. “I know. I didn’t realize at 8.”

She sniffled again. “I eventually came clean to my mom. When she found out the truth, she was devastated. She hung herself the next day.”

“Oh my God..” I said breathlessly. 

“I see her too, sometimes.”

I watched her quietly, not sure what to say.

“I see them both all the time. They are constant reminders of what I did.”

She took a deep breath. “I thought I was helping at the time. But I was so wrong.”

I nodded, “that was really fucked up.”

She took a deep breath and made eye contact with me again. “I called you here because I want to put a hit out on myself.”

“What?” I said, taken aback.

“I want you to kill me. I can’t live like this anymore.” 

I took a deep breath and watched her for a moment. I could see the pain in her eyes. This woman had lived with this guilt for most of her life. She could never get rid of it, no matter what. While I was absolutely disgusted by the lies she had told, I felt bad for her all the same. She was just a child with no real concept of the consequences of her actions. And now, she just wanted the punishment to end. I nodded quietly and asked for a glass of water. 

The young girl returned a few moments later with a glass of water, handing it over with a shaky hand. I took it gently and  pulled a folded up piece of paper out of my pocket, sighing softly. “I don’t think that’s the answer.”

“What do you mean?”

I sighed softly, “10 years ago, when my husband confronted Joel about his accusations before ending his life, Joel begged my husband to let him write a short note to his daughter. My husband was hesitant because of what he believed Joel had been doing, but figured he would just keep the note and kill Joel. Joel scribbled something down on a piece of paper and folded it up, handing it to my husband. My husband never had the courage to read the note, but he never got rid of it. It was like some kind of sick souvenir. He never thought that it would actually reach its destination. However, when we got the call, he dug it up out of some old boxes and decided to bring it along, just in case. I think you should have it.”

The young lady unfolded the note and read it out loud, “Haddie, I love you so much and I forgive you.” A loud sob escaped her mouth as tears poured out of her eyes. I sat the small revolver on the coffee table and made my exit. I heard a gunshot as I climbed into the passenger seat.

Mark looked over at me. “Well?”

He pulled out of the parking lot and headed towards a hotel for the night. I told him the entire story and he smiled softly. “I always knew you were soft.” 

I rolled my eyes playfully. “Yeah.”

“It was really clever of you to write that note.”

“Yeah, well some clients are just so self sufficient.”",t2_1k4fw1kp,False,,0,False,My husband and I are hitmen.

&lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes. It may be insensitive considering that this woman had probably never ordered a hit on someone before, but this was my life. Every day of my life. The same shit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need you to take care of someone for me.” she whispered into the phone, fear seeming to creep into her voice. Now I was intrigued. This woman was scared and that could mean a few things. Usually, it meant that she was a victim of some kind of abuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need a name, address and bank account number” I said, not letting any emotion seep into my voice. It was easier to keep it plain and simple. Although the reason behind the hits usually came out, sometimes it was easier not to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have an address, exactly. But I can give you an area”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes again. She doesn’t even have the information I need to make this as smooth as possible. We charge extra if we have to track them down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“His name is Joel Marteen. He usually shows up on north market street. Sometimes he walks down 4th street. Just depends on the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jotted this information down in my black notebook. “I need a description.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard her take a deep breath on the other end and could hear a slight tremble. “He is about 6 foot 1. Maybe 200 pounds. Age is around 55 years old. Brown hair. Brown eyes. Tattoo under left eye.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big breath comes from the other end of the line. “Right side of his head is blown off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at the phone momentarily. Did I hear that right? Was this some bullshit call? “Hey, if this is some bullshit call.. I swear to God, I will hunt you-”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not bullshit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How can half his fucking head be gone?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My mother hired your partner to kill him around 10 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, he never fucks up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well he did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood began to pool in my face as I felt anger rise up in me. “Are you sure this is the same guy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think I know what my own fucking father looks like” she all but screamed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled the phone away from my ear and took a deep breath. “Okay. I will consult with him. We require half the money now, half when the job is done. 2 separate accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay.” And then the phone clicked and the call ended just as fast as it had started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set the phone down and took another deep breath, staring at the information I had written on the page in front of me: Joel Marteen, 55, should be dead already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood and went into the kitchen to find Mark making pancakes while our daughters sat at the kitchen table, coloring pictures of princesses and unicorns. “Mommy, look!” Cecilia smiled as she held up her picture to proudly show me. Lilly held hers up as well, copying everything her big sister did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled, “wow, those are really pretty.” I walked over to Mark who planted a light kiss on my cheek. I leaned against him as he flipped over a pancake, “we’ve got an interesting one.” I said softly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark set the last pancake onto a plate and covered both stacks with syrup. He set a plate in front of each girl and kissed each on top of the head before retreating to our office. I followed quietly as our daughters dug into their breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark sat in his computer chair and looked up at me, “well?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some young girl called from what I assume was a phone booth in Alabama. Number is not connected to any name.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark nodded, “okay..”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She put a hit out on her father. Joel. 55 year old male. 6’1, brown hair, brown eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Distinct markings?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chuckled slightly at this. “Yeah. Tattoo under left eye. No right side of face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband stared at me for a moment in disbelief. Then he stood up “okay. Ha ha. You got me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m not joking. And I don’t think she was either.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband rolled his eyes, “you can’t be serious?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She said that they had hired you a long time ago to do the hit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband looked at me, a bit of confusion in his eyes, “Joel?” I saw his eyes look up as he thought about his past and tried to recover any memories of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Joel Marteen.” I clarified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband immediately met my gaze. “What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s his name. Marteen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband began shaking his head and chuckling slightly, “no way. This is just some bullshit prank call.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She seemed pretty serious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked at me again, looking for any hints of joking in my face. He must have found none because he continued, “I killed that man 10 years ago. I remember it very vividly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband sat back down and took a deep breath, “his wife ordered the hit on him. After years of abuse, she was tired of living that way. She suspected he had begun sexually abusing their 8 year old.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jesus Christ.” I said softly. Cecilia was only 4, but I couldn’t imagine someone doing that to her. I didn’t even want to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I shot him at point blank range in the head. He died almost instantly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, clearly he didn’t. Because the girl is calling-”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I checked his goddamn pulse, Renee. He was dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched my husband for a moment before deciding to believe him. “Well, if he is dead then how the hell is he walking around? And this girl said he killed her mother. How did he do that if he’s dead?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband set his head in his hands. “I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath and took his hand gently in mine. “Maybe we should just meet him. Not kill him?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband looked up at me, “are you insane? Meet the guy I killed?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, that’s up for debate still.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark rolled his eyes, “I don’t know..”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s the only thing we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark took another deep breath before slowly nodding his head. I was always right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, we dropped the kids off at Mark’s parents’ house and loaded up the car. We weren’t sure if this was a hit or not because we really weren’t sure what we were dealing with. We started the long ride to Alabama, in near silence the entire way. Neither of us would say it, but we were both terrified of what we were about to encounter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally got to Alabama late the following night. We parked along the street with a clear view of north market street. We waited and waited, but never saw a man with half a face turn up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we saw a young woman, about 18 walk down the street. She looked around fearfully as she walked back towards a crummy apartment building. Something inside me just told me this was the girl who had called. We decided to follow her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We parked the car and I got out to confront her. I walked up to her and she immediately recognized my voice the second I called out to her. “It’s you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded slowly, unsure of what to say next. She sighed softly and in a near whisper said, “follow me. Just you, not him.” I assumed she was referring to Mark. I looked back at the car and gave him the signal to wait. He seemed to want to argue my decision but I ultimately won and followed the young girl inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way up the stairs and into her small studio apartment. She sat down on her couch, tears already beginning to flow and motioned for me to sit in the chair across from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cautiously sat down. “I don’t understand.. We watched for hours and never saw any-”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know.” She said abruptly. “Only I can see him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to shake my head, standing up to leave. This was just some psycho who was having some kind of mental break.&lt;br/&gt;
“Please let me explain,” she begged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat back down, watching her every move. I was unsure if I was in danger, but I didn’t want to take any chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My mother called your partner to take care of my dad years ago. Their relationship wasn’t very good and sometimes things go physical. I hated that he sometimes hit her. But she hit him way more. I was so sick of the fighting and yelling. I just wanted them to break up and move on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched her face, trying to comprehend what this confession was about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I knew she wouldn’t leave on her own. So, I had to help her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded slowly, “help her..?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She took a deep breath, a few more tears falling. “I told her that he had been touching me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bit my lip, hard, trying to hold back the words that wanted to pour out of my mouth. Lying about something like that was absolutely disgusting, even from an 8 year old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought she’d just leave him,” she looked down at her lap, “I didn’t know she’d have him killed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, that’s a pretty fucked up thing. I’d kill anyone I thought did that to my kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She nodded, more tears falling, sniffling. “I know. I didn’t realize at 8.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sniffled again. “I eventually came clean to my mom. When she found out the truth, she was devastated. She hung herself the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh my God..” I said breathlessly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see her too, sometimes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched her quietly, not sure what to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see them both all the time. They are constant reminders of what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She took a deep breath. “I thought I was helping at the time. But I was so wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded, “that was really fucked up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She took a deep breath and made eye contact with me again. “I called you here because I want to put a hit out on myself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?” I said, taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want you to kill me. I can’t live like this anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath and watched her for a moment. I could see the pain in her eyes. This woman had lived with this guilt for most of her life. She could never get rid of it, no matter what. While I was absolutely disgusted by the lies she had told, I felt bad for her all the same. She was just a child with no real concept of the consequences of her actions. And now, she just wanted the punishment to end. I nodded quietly and asked for a glass of water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young girl returned a few moments later with a glass of water, handing it over with a shaky hand. I took it gently and  pulled a folded up piece of paper out of my pocket, sighing softly. “I don’t think that’s the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed softly, “10 years ago, when my husband confronted Joel about his accusations before ending his life, Joel begged my husband to let him write a short note to his daughter. My husband was hesitant because of what he believed Joel had been doing, but figured he would just keep the note and kill Joel. Joel scribbled something down on a piece of paper and folded it up, handing it to my husband. My husband never had the courage to read the note, but he never got rid of it. It was like some kind of sick souvenir. He never thought that it would actually reach its destination. However, when we got the call, he dug it up out of some old boxes and decided to bring it along, just in case. I think you should have it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young lady unfolded the note and read it out loud, “Haddie, I love you so much and I forgive you.” A loud sob escaped her mouth as tears poured out of her eyes. I sat the small revolver on the coffee table and made my exit. I heard a gunshot as I climbed into the passenger seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark looked over at me. “Well?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pulled out of the parking lot and headed towards a hotel for the night. I told him the entire story and he smiled softly. “I always knew you were soft.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes playfully. “Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was really clever of you to write that note.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, well some clients are just so self sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

She asks for a decent amount of money compared to other babysitters on that website, but my parents were going on a couples retreat and wanted to leave me and my brother in the best of hands considering our grandparents moved down to Florida a few years ago.

It was only a few days so I was sure me and Andy could have managed but they just wanted to make sure. My parents ensured us they'd call us every night.

We were sitting in front of the TV with our cereal as my mom was about to let in the new babysitter. She adjusted her tropical dress straps and put her hat on. I really miss our old babysitter. I wasn't sure what happened to her.

""Come on in."" My mother smiled. An old, wrinkly woman came inching in with her walker. She seemed like a bag of bones. Her little white shoes had dirt marks on them and her floral dress that was once white had some age on it.

""Hello there."" She cranked up her hearing aid. ""My name is Patricia but I go by Pattie.""

""Well Pattie we sure do appreciate you watching our boys while we go. I got the best recommendation from Phil up the street."" My father smiled and stretched his hand out.

She gently grabbed his hand. I could tell how fragile she was with how she barely touched his hand.

""Ahh yes. He has such sweet daughters. They said they plan on booking me in a few weeks.""

Our parents hugged us and left after giving the babysitter some non important instructions.

""I seemed to have left my bag in the car. Could you grab it dear?"" 

I ran outside and seen an old, worn out Chrysler New Yorker . She did leave her bag next to it. It wasn't heavy or anything. I pulled it in without a hesitation.

""Ah, thank you.""

She pulled out a doll. It was old. Had blonde hair that looked stiff like broom bristles. it wore overalls and a long sleeve white shirt. It was missing an eye....just a black hole.

""Alrighty boys. This is your babysitter. Mr. Pepper. He doesn't like Tom foolery so I better go over the rules.""

We honestly thought she was joking.

""Rule one: lights out at eight
Rule two: do your chores you are assigned
Rule three: leave out raw meat right before bed on the counter
Rule four: do not argue with me, his caretaker.
Rule five: your parents are to leave a five star review when they get back or else. And if a rule gets broken then you will go to the farm.""

I asked a very dumb question

""What's the farm?""

""You really don't want to know."" 

""I think you're lying."" Andy blurred out. ""You're just trying to scare us Into behaving.""

""Mr. Pepper doesn't like being tempted."" She pointed at him ""in fact he's gonna send you there for ten minutes as a one time warning.""

The doll lifted an arm up and Andy just disappeared.

Tears filled my eyes. I wanted to run  it I was scares he would send me too.

Patty walked over to me and rubbed her clammy hands on my face.

,nosleep,"What is the most beautiful sight you can imagine? For me, it is a head falling into a basket in the name of justice. 

Did you know that the first Guillotine-like machine was constructed in Ireland, almost 500 years before the French built the real one? It was imperfect, just like the prototype I built at home using my father's shaving razor blade when I was twelve. 

It was a small, crude version of the beautiful invention. I tried it out on rats and mice, but to my disappointment, it did not even work correctly on them. There was blood everywhere in my room, and rodents running around with deep cuts, it was horrible.

Of course, it is hard to build such a magnificent machine when your father hinders your work. He beat me half to death when he found the decapitated rat corpses in my room, even destroyed my first Guillotine. He did not realize that he was the one who motivated me to create it in the first place. 

I was only ten years when it happened, but I understood why he had to kill my mother. Unfaithfulness must be punished. But stabbing her with a kitchen knife over and over again was so inefficient, so barbaric. I never told anyone what my father did. I wanted to execute him personally. 

I knew there must be a better way to kill someone, so I did the research and found my hero, Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin. I worked for the same goal he had in mind all those years ago, to reduce suffering while promoting justice. 

After my first Guillotine was destroyed, I was devastated. I knew my father would never let me try to build another one. I was already sixteen when I found out that my history teacher was just as enthusiastic about the French Revolution as I was. So I told him that the 1792 Guillotine construction drawings could be purchased online for just 38 dollars.

It took some persuasion, but in the end, he bought the plans. Every Friday afternoon, we worked together on building a life-sized remake of the original Guillotine in the school's woodworking classroom. It was the best time of my life. We were just like Antoine Louis and Tobias Schmidt, the creators of the first French prototype.

After many months of trial and error, we finally finished the magical device. The only part missing was the blade. Fortunately, many companies sell large blades to slaughterhouses. I was able to order one online but kept it secret because I knew my teacher never intended to truly complete our project. He wanted to make a fake blade out of paper and set up the device in the school as a piece of art, so I had to take matters into my own hands. 

It would have been a crime not to use the machine after so much work. So a few hours ago — after my father passed out from drinking all day — I took his keys and drove his pickup truck to school to get my Guillotine. 

Sneaking into the workshop, disassembling the device, loading the parts onto the pickup, it all went easier than expected. It was like someone from the heavens was watching over me. This divine help did not surprise me as I was doing everything in the name of true justice. 

Once I got home, I set up the wonderful Guillotine in our garage and added the missing, razor-sharp part. After it was finally complete, I entered my father's room and pulled him out. He was struggling, but he had no chance against someone who's hand was led by righteousness.

I dragged him into the garage, tied him facedown on the Bascule (a kind of teeterboard used to secure the sinner's body into the proper position for judgment) and locked his head into the Lunette (the part of the Guillotine which is used to hold the neck of the condemned in place). 

Most of the aristocrats who were executed during the French Revolution were proud, they did not plead for mercy and did not struggle. But my father was no aristocrat, he cried and begged as I was preparing him for his decapitation. 

I gave him a chance to speak his last words, but instead, he kept screaming. So I did what I had to, released the blade and watched in awe as it silenced him forever. 

I thought I would rejoice, that it would be the most beautiful sight I have ever seen. But, I feel... I feel guilty. I am no true judge, I have to atone for my sin just like everyone else. I realized that by doing this, I became just like my father — a killer. This fills me with disgust, but justice could still be served.

It seems the screaming alerted my neighbors. I can already hear police sirens in the distance. I know I must be punished, but it is not up to them to judge me.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is hard to build such a magnificent machine when your father hinders your work. He beat me half to death when he found the decapitated rat corpses in my room, even destroyed my first Guillotine. He did not realize that he was the one who motivated me to create it in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was only ten years when it happened, but I understood why he had to kill my mother. Unfaithfulness must be punished. But stabbing her with a kitchen knife over and over again was so inefficient, so barbaric. I never told anyone what my father did. I wanted to execute him personally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew there must be a better way to kill someone, so I did the research and found my hero, Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin. I worked for the same goal he had in mind all those years ago, to reduce suffering while promoting justice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my first Guillotine was destroyed, I was devastated. I knew my father would never let me try to build another one. I was already sixteen when I found out that my history teacher was just as enthusiastic about the French Revolution as I was. So I told him that the 1792 Guillotine construction drawings could be purchased online for just 38 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took some persuasion, but in the end, he bought the plans. Every Friday afternoon, we worked together on building a life-sized remake of the original Guillotine in the school&amp;#39;s woodworking classroom. It was the best time of my life. We were just like Antoine Louis and Tobias Schmidt, the creators of the first French prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many months of trial and error, we finally finished the magical device. The only part missing was the blade. Fortunately, many companies sell large blades to slaughterhouses. I was able to order one online but kept it secret because I knew my teacher never intended to truly complete our project. He wanted to make a fake blade out of paper and set up the device in the school as a piece of art, so I had to take matters into my own hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been a crime not to use the machine after so much work. So a few hours ago — after my father passed out from drinking all day — I took his keys and drove his pickup truck to school to get my Guillotine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sneaking into the workshop, disassembling the device, loading the parts onto the pickup, it all went easier than expected. It was like someone from the heavens was watching over me. This divine help did not surprise me as I was doing everything in the name of true justice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got home, I set up the wonderful Guillotine in our garage and added the missing, razor-sharp part. After it was finally complete, I entered my father&amp;#39;s room and pulled him out. He was struggling, but he had no chance against someone who&amp;#39;s hand was led by righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dragged him into the garage, tied him facedown on the Bascule (a kind of teeterboard used to secure the sinner&amp;#39;s body into the proper position for judgment) and locked his head into the Lunette (the part of the Guillotine which is used to hold the neck of the condemned in place). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the aristocrats who were executed during the French Revolution were proud, they did not plead for mercy and did not struggle. But my father was no aristocrat, he cried and begged as I was preparing him for his decapitation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave him a chance to speak his last words, but instead, he kept screaming. So I did what I had to, released the blade and watched in awe as it silenced him forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would rejoice, that it would be the most beautiful sight I have ever seen. But, I feel... I feel guilty. I am no true judge, I have to atone for my sin just like everyone else. I realized that by doing this, I became just like my father — a killer. This fills me with disgust, but justice could still be served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the screaming alerted my neighbors. I can already hear police sirens in the distance. I know I must be punished, but it is not up to them to judge me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided who will be executed next by my lovely Guillotine...&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"Not having Baloo on the train was something [bittersweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fch91t/my_second_day_at_disney_world_is_unsaturated/).

Mostly [bitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f7wgnl/my_second_day_at_disney_world_and_somethings/), because I missed him and felt so much [smaller](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e92q1e/my_first_day_on_the_job_at_disney_world_didnt_go/) without him here.

However, he was also a big source of brume, and without him on the train, we didn't have the weird shift between dimensions and the mob of brume monsters wasn't gunning for us from the void.

I felt horribly guilty and selfish thinking like that. So, I instinctively focus on how much I missed him instead. However, that also made me feel like I was just doing it to be a better, less selfish person, making me feel more ashamed and just sucky overall. I wished that my fear didn't make me so self-centered all the time. I wondered if Brer Fox was going through any similar thoughts on his end.

We hunkered down in the train car, tense and wary of our surroundings, twitching at the slightest sound. I held up the wand, which made the fox give me an incredulous look; we both remembered what happened last time.

""Do you think I should try to turn us invisible?"" I whispered, rather than just activate the wand. Using the wand had been what alerted the brume monsters to us last time; they'd seen the green light coming from the train. But, I didn't know if it was the wand's power, period, that attracted them, or if it was just the light. Plus, this was now the Vorpal Wand, and it was partially embedded with the brume from earlier, right? Unless I just misunderstood how it's transformation had worked.

Brer Fox shook his head. ""You tryin' to get us kilt? We gots dis shiny armor for a reason!""

I sighed and reluctantly lowered the wand. He was right; our armor was also embedded with brume, and it was supposed to make us less noticeable. It would be safer to just ride and hope for the best.

As I had that thought, the whole locomotive creaked and started to move. It had done this last time, too; I'd wondered if there was a driver before, but now I suspected it might be related to my ""dead human perceives reality"" powers. I really needed to learn more about how my perception worked, so I could use it to my advantage rather than just mutate myself again.

Back to back, we kept our eyes on either side of the car, bent low in our seats. The ride was so much quieter without Baloo's humming in the background, which was, again, bittersweet. Plants and trees rushed by, faster and faster, and the fog combed through our fur, cold and wet. We said nothing, waiting for any sign of an enemy lurking in the woods.

The underbrush stayed dark and silent, absent of animals and monsters. This time, it didn't warp into a white void, which was probably a good sign. However, it didn't look like the jungle I remembered from the actual Animal Kingdom's train ride. The thick, rubbery leaves and bamboo were transitioning into tall, twisting pine and oak trees. I watched with confusion as we steered into something more open and wooded; the canopy was still overly shaded above us, but it wasn't as dense as before. It didn't really look like Animal Kingdom at all.

There was a soft whistling in my ears, and a tinny laugh in the back of my head. I winced. I was hoping the Jabberwocky would stay away a little longer, but he had to come back at some point. He was a part of me now, after all. He didn't feel quite as icy or loud now that I'd spent the night at the treehouse and decked up in brume armor, so I hoped that he wouldn't be able to impact me as much, but I needed to stay wary. Considering we'd gone a layer down in the Sleeping Tree, we might even be closer to the decapitated ""body"" of the Jabberwocky, wherever that was. At least if Milo was right about him climbing up through the layers when I found him.

The thought made me shudder. The entity's head had been terrifying enough, as a hungry blob of darkness and eyes. I didn't want to know what the rest of it looked like.

A carnival booth passed us by, and I jerked, watching it go past. It looked like one of the games from the Dinoland section of Animal Kingdom, which didn't make sense, because the train wasn't anywhere near that part of the park. But, no--there went another booth, the face paint one. It was definitely the Dinoland fair.

The train pulled to a slow stop, and we waited a moment, frozen. Nobody came to get us, no monsters crept through the windows. Behind me, Brer Fox slumped with relief. I didn't, too confused about the environment. This *was* a dream, albeit a different person's dream than the one we'd just left. I guess I'd just expected it to look more like the park I knew. It could be that the further we got from the center of the Tree, where our previous dream was, the less and less the dreams would resemble reality.

Which was worrying, because I didn't know what to expect.

My fox friend tugged on my arm, and I realized that I'd been staring into space. I shook the thoughts away and followed him out of the car. He skipped the open door and jumped over the gate instead, as usual. I frowned at the waist-high partition. He did that so easily, but then, he was a good bit taller than me. But, then again, knowing how to do that *would* be convenient for later, right?

I took a short running start with what little space I had, grabbed the gate, and hopped. One leg went over, and the other knee slammed into the wood, sending me flipping in a graceful flop over the top. I hit the dirt face-first and got a mouth full of mud.

High-pitched cackled filled the air as I spat and gagged, but no amount of slavering could get out the grit between my teeth.  I sat up to glare at the fox beside me. ""Your concern is so touching.""

He snickered and slapped his knee. ""Yer almos' as runty as that rabbit I hunt, but ya sure ain't able to jump as high!"" I wiped mud off my face, briefly checked to see if I stained my spats-things - nope, the dirt just slipped right off the material, nice - then crossed my arms and huffed.

Ignoring him, I finally looked at the station around us, and it hit me that it wasn't actually a station. It was just a dirt clearing in the woods, although I could see lights and hear carnival music through the trees. For some reason, even though I was rolling in the dirt, I hadn't actually noticed that it was *dirt* and not the cement of the Wildlife Express queue. Where were we?

My companion didn't offer his hand, but I grabbed his arm anyway, making him jump to his feet and almost sending me straight back to the ground. He snickered again, and I punched him in the side. Once I was standing, though, nothing gained any familiarity. It was still just a bunch of woods in a decidedly un-Animal Kingdom-like area. That meant we would have to make our way out of here to figure out where we were. Which would be a lot more terrifying, if the sounds of life weren't just a short ways through the trees.

I really hoped that we wouldn't ever have to run straight through the woods in this place, because the outskirts of dreams tend to be lesser developed and more void-y, and that meant brume monsters. On the other hand, hoping against that made me worried about jinxing things, so I tried to shove the thought out of my head instead.

The tinny voice giggled again, and I ignored it harder.

I shrugged at the fox and gestured to the trees. ""I guess we should go see what all the noise is coming from."" He narrowed his eyes at the trees like he didn't like it, but fell in line with me anyways, loping at a cautious pace towards the lights.

""How're we gonna find what's got the she-bug all cuckoo?"" He asked as we walked.

""Well..."" I bit my lip, which was beginning to hurt from all my reluctance-borne chewing. ""Maybe we should try to ask around, and see if anyone has noticed her coming here, or where she went? She had to have come through here, right? Unless she just went down to the next level below us."" In which case, we'd ridden the train for nothing. That hadn't occurred to me until just then. Dang it. We were so bad at thinking ahead.

Brer Fox sniffed. ""Jus' be sure we ain't makin' folks think *we's* the cuckoo ones.""

Oh, that was a good point, too. If we weren't careful about this, we would draw attention to ourselves, and that was the last thing I wanted to do with whatever had warped the Godmother.

Before I could reply, we'd crossed the short distance from the train and broke through the treeline. Suddenly, we were surrounded by flashing lights, roaring rides, and jumbled-up voices everywhere. This wasn't just a carnival, it was a carni*vale.*

Where the previous dream had been sparsely populated, this one was bursting with toons. And, where the previous dream's occupants avoided each other in the fog, these ones got right up in each other's faces, passing around food, shouting to be be heard over the rides, punching each other for small slights, and punctuated by criers for shows and booths. There were just as many fallen objects as in the previous dream, though, but this was because all the toons kept dropping popcorn and wrappers and cheap souvenirs into the dirt.

Yesterday had been so quiet, with such a wide berth between the toons I ran into. This was so much the opposite that I now felt claustrophobic. Based on the way Brer Fox's fur spiked up and his tail twitched, he probably felt the same; the woods he lived in with Brer Bear probably had a much smaller population.

As I'd thought, though, this was a heavily expanded version of Dinoland, USA, which was on the opposite end of Animal Kingdom in real life. There was the giant (or, I guess, life sized?) longneck dinosaur sculpture that towered above the area, except, unlike in the real park, this one was moving around, lowering its neck to chat with people.

There was the mousetrap ride, Primeval Whirl, one one side, and and the triceratops Dumbo ride on the other. Between them, though, was the arcade from Main Street in Magic Kingdom. Toy Story Mania from Hollywood Studios sat behind that. Then there was a line of street food stands from several parts of Epcot. The strangest things, though, were the booths I didn't recognize. A miniature museum, with a stand of breakable objects to toss at its windows, like glass bottles and ceramic teacups. A Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round... it wasn't until I saw the giant clown balloon pass by that I finally got it.

""This is Pleasure Island??"" My mouth dropped, and I could barely believe what was coming out of my mouth.

""It's what now?"" Brer Fox didn't see the significance of this.

""Pleasure Island!"" I repeated, then felt dumb, because repeating things never made people understand things better. ""It's a place from an old movie. This isn't *exactly* it, but it's definitely been *merged* with it. This... this completely changes things!""

I turned to the fox, whose eyes were not lighting up with the shock that I felt. ""You gonna explain that er what?""

That was really hard when my brain was running a mile a minute, but I had to try to slow down my thoughts so that he could catch up. ""Brer, up until now, I thought that the Jabberwocky was lying when he said enough human dreams could bring you guys home. Like, that was part of his scheme for manipulating everyone. But, look at this!"" I waved my hands around, and *now* the fox's eyebrows were beginning to raise. ""This was only *one* level below our dream, and it's already merging with a cartoon. The other parts of this dream could be merged with different parts of that movie, or with different stories altogether. He's bringing the stories *here,* just like he brought *you* here. Why? What's the point?"" I flapped my arms, unable to focus on making specific gestures anymore. ""I can't decide if this is good or *really, really bad!!""*

Brer Fox's eyes widened as I spoke, then he looked around again, new understanding in his eyes. ""...I don't like that,"" he finally decided. ""Places ain't alive like people, they don't know they ain't coming out right.""

It was hard to parse that, but somehow, I had to agree. This felt wrong all around.

We stood there a moment, absorbing the weirdness that was the jigsaw fair. Then one of the toons ran past, sending a wave of sticky, cinnamon nuts over us, and our shock was broken. It took another few minutes of rabid yanking to get the candy out of our fur, which left us sore and cranky, but at least it didn't stick to our new clothes.

Standing in one place probably wasn't a good idea if we didn't want to draw attention, especially given how I was shouting about the Jabberwocky, but thankfully, we'd been close enough to the trees not to pull any eyes our way. We didn't want to test our luck, though, so we started making our way through the crowd. This was where my Theme Park Skills(TM) finally became useful, as I kept a hand on Brer Fox's wrist and wove around the clusters of people. This made us a short, but unbreakable, line, especially when a few toons tried to run between us and my friend dug his claws into my spats-braces, clotheslining the brats before they could separate us. Seriously, where was their crowd etiquette? I guess if they were some of the kids from the movie's Pleasure Island, they probably didn't even know what etiquette was.

There was a free space behind one of the popcorn stands, and we did a quick huddle there. If we were going to get information, we had to have a gameplan. I pointed at the Toy Story Mania ride, which was just barely visible in the throngs of people. ""The characters from that movie are pretty friendly, they might be more willing to help us out than the characters from Pleasure Island.""

""Whatever gets me outta this lake a'loonies,"" Brer Fox growled. Someone stepped on his tail as they ran by, and he rounded on them, baring his teeth in a snarl. The toon screamed and fled into the crowd, disappearing from sight.

We kept our grip on each other's wrists as we pushed towards the ride, elbows locked in front of us to divert annoying people away from our center of mass. At some point I stepped in something sticky, probably soda, and stumbled a little in my disgust. Brer Fox hit my back and I made myself keep walking, gagging and sliding my paw against the grass, which only somewhat assuaged the grossness.

Finally we reached the big, cardboard cutouts that marked the ride's entrance. In the real world, these were more of the moulded cement that Disney was so good at making, but here, they were actual cardboard. Hand-painted carnival pictures lined the material, and we slid into the entry queue for the line. I was intending to wait in line like a polite person, but evidently, my friend was *not.* When I stopped moving, he ran up behind me, tossed me over his shoulder (I *shouted,* I did *not* squeak like a rubber ducky), and vaulted over all the guide rails like an angry Olympian.

He dumped me on the ground at the front door, then, without giving me time to recover, grabbed my arm and dragged me to my feet, pulling me inside and slamming the door shut. He slumped against the door, breathing raggedly, fur spiking with anxiety-static.

Oh, wow. He must have *actually* had claustrophobia. I would have to keep that in mind the next time we were in a tight space.

Attempting to comfort him would probably make him feel worse, as much as I would rather talk the feelings out myself, so with some restraint, I patted his shoulder and turned to look at the shooting gallery instead.

I really should have expected this, considering the only ride I'd been on in this reality had been the train, but the ride was no longer a ride. It was an actual galleria, with multiple levels, and a big, open space in the middle where a bunch of stairs ran down to the bottom. I leaned over the railing, trying to see how many floors down the place went, awed by how big it was. On every wall was a separate gallery, with Toy Story characters laughing and heckling the guests as they tossed targets or steered conveyor belts. Dozens of waist-high, green soldiers (finally toons that were shorter than me!) ran to and fro, climbing up the stairs or parachuting down them, carrying new bins of the rubbish discusses that were the staple here.

Well, at least *these* guys looked like they were having a good time. I wondered if they even knew about the problems outside this little world, about the shadow monsters creeping up on everything. I wondered if any of them had been tainted like the Godmother.

""Um, excuse me!"" I tried to wave down one of the army men passing by. He ignored me. ""Hello, could you--"" I tapped another on the shoulder, and he shrugged me off. *""Hey,* I need help here!"" Nobody would look at me. They were all too single-minded in maintaining the galleria. Enough so that it got my suspicion senses tingling. Normally, the soldiers in the movies were pretty gung-ho about helping the others, right?

With an aggravated sigh, I turned back to Brer Fox. ""We're going to have to search through this mess for someone who will talk to us. Sorry.""

The fox made a noise between a growl and a hiss, pressing closer to the door, which was beginning to rattle with the fists of the people he'd locked outside.

I rubbed the back of my neck, glancing between him and the galleria. ""Would you prefer staying here while I did the searching?""

""You crazy?"" he snapped. ""We ain't splitting up here!""

Oh, good. Even if he hadn't ever read a horror story before, he was still genre savvy enough to know that splitting up was a bad idea. I held out my arm, and he griped a moment before grabbing my wrist again, and we started once more weaving through the crowd.

First, I tried getting the attention of the toys in the booths. Most of them were too focused on making more targets and then ducking out of the way to see the results, shouting insults or encouragement, depending. Because we weren't doing the shooting, we couldn't catch their eyes. Mrs. Potato Head gave us a concerned look while her husband heckled a particularly clumsy toon, but she still didn't come over, no matter how hard I waved. I supposed that was smart, considering what kind of toons probably frequented here.

The claw-game aliens were just as single-minded as the soldiers were, which was worrisome. They only said their catch phrases, ""oooo,"" and ""the claawwwww,"" and ""we are eternally grateful!"" over and over.

In fact, quite a few of the toys were like that. Stinky Pete was saying generally villainous lines without any heart in them. Trixie grinned at us wordlessly, with decidedly plastic eyes. Jessie jumped around, hooting and hollering, with much more life in her, but when the army men came to sweep up the debris and refill the discuss stocks, she just stood in the back, stiff and blank. The more I looked for someone who could help us, the more I became disheartened. Were any of these people alive, or were they just illusions made by the ride? Or, worse, were they alive and tainted in the same way the Godmother was? Heck, Mrs. Potato Head's concern might have just been her default face between watching guests.

At first, I'd been kind of happy for these guys; unlike the other toons we'd met, they all had each other. They were all together in this, and having fun. But, now? Now, I wasn't sure if I was looking at toons, or moving corpses.

While Brer Fox grew more agitated by the crowds, I grew more desperate, going down floor after floor to find somebody, *anybody* we could talk to.

None of the people in the crowd were familiar. They were all background faces in the movies; kids from Pleasure Island and animal anthros from any number of movies, maybe Zootopia or Robin Hood. It wasn't until we reached the fifth and final sub-level of the galleria that I finally saw someone I knew. Leaning against Ham's booth, almost tucked behind it, was a figure mostly noticeable because he was taller than the average child, bunny, or turtle scurrying by his feet. He was tossing a coin in one hand and examining the crowd with shifty eyes, a sleazy smile on a vulpine snout that was *just* different enough from my companion's to be extremely uncomfortable. They had been drawn in very different styles, after all.

The other fox noticed that someone was staring at him, and his eyes met mine, narrowing in thought. He caught the coin and shoved it in his coat pocket, slipping further behind the booth and out of sight.

I shuddered in disgust. I'd been hoping to find somebody *nice* to talk to. Of call the people here who might have information for me, why did the first one to notice us have to be *John Foulfellow??*

&lt;p&gt;A carnival booth passed us by, and I jerked, watching it go past. It looked like one of the games from the Dinoland section of Animal Kingdom, which didn&amp;#39;t make sense, because the train wasn&amp;#39;t anywhere near that part of the park. But, no--there went another booth, the face paint one. It was definitely the Dinoland fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train pulled to a slow stop, and we waited a moment, frozen. Nobody came to get us, no monsters crept through the windows. Behind me, Brer Fox slumped with relief. I didn&amp;#39;t, too confused about the environment. This &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a dream, albeit a different person&amp;#39;s dream than the one we&amp;#39;d just left. I guess I&amp;#39;d just expected it to look more like the park I knew. It could be that the further we got from the center of the Tree, where our previous dream was, the less and less the dreams would resemble reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was worrying, because I didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fox friend tugged on my arm, and I realized that I&amp;#39;d been staring into space. I shook the thoughts away and followed him out of the car. He skipped the open door and jumped over the gate instead, as usual. I frowned at the waist-high partition. He did that so easily, but then, he was a good bit taller than me. But, then again, knowing how to do that &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be convenient for later, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a short running start with what little space I had, grabbed the gate, and hopped. One leg went over, and the other knee slammed into the wood, sending me flipping in a graceful flop over the top. I hit the dirt face-first and got a mouth full of mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-pitched cackled filled the air as I spat and gagged, but no amount of slavering could get out the grit between my teeth.  I sat up to glare at the fox beside me. &amp;quot;Your concern is so touching.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He snickered and slapped his knee. &amp;quot;Yer almos&amp;#39; as runty as that rabbit I hunt, but ya sure ain&amp;#39;t able to jump as high!&amp;quot; I wiped mud off my face, briefly checked to see if I stained my spats-things - nope, the dirt just slipped right off the material, nice - then crossed my arms and huffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring him, I finally looked at the station around us, and it hit me that it wasn&amp;#39;t actually a station. It was just a dirt clearing in the woods, although I could see lights and hear carnival music through the trees. For some reason, even though I was rolling in the dirt, I hadn&amp;#39;t actually noticed that it was &lt;em&gt;dirt&lt;/em&gt; and not the cement of the Wildlife Express queue. Where were we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My companion didn&amp;#39;t offer his hand, but I grabbed his arm anyway, making him jump to his feet and almost sending me straight back to the ground. He snickered again, and I punched him in the side. Once I was standing, though, nothing gained any familiarity. It was still just a bunch of woods in a decidedly un-Animal Kingdom-like area. That meant we would have to make our way out of here to figure out where we were. Which would be a lot more terrifying, if the sounds of life weren&amp;#39;t just a short ways through the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hoped that we wouldn&amp;#39;t ever have to run straight through the woods in this place, because the outskirts of dreams tend to be lesser developed and more void-y, and that meant brume monsters. On the other hand, hoping against that made me worried about jinxing things, so I tried to shove the thought out of my head instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tinny voice giggled again, and I ignored it harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shrugged at the fox and gestured to the trees. &amp;quot;I guess we should go see what all the noise is coming from.&amp;quot; He narrowed his eyes at the trees like he didn&amp;#39;t like it, but fell in line with me anyways, loping at a cautious pace towards the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How&amp;#39;re we gonna find what&amp;#39;s got the she-bug all cuckoo?&amp;quot; He asked as we walked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well...&amp;quot; I bit my lip, which was beginning to hurt from all my reluctance-borne chewing. &amp;quot;Maybe we should try to ask around, and see if anyone has noticed her coming here, or where she went? She had to have come through here, right? Unless she just went down to the next level below us.&amp;quot; In which case, we&amp;#39;d ridden the train for nothing. That hadn&amp;#39;t occurred to me until just then. Dang it. We were so bad at thinking ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brer Fox sniffed. &amp;quot;Jus&amp;#39; be sure we ain&amp;#39;t makin&amp;#39; folks think &lt;em&gt;we&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; the cuckoo ones.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, that was a good point, too. If we weren&amp;#39;t careful about this, we would draw attention to ourselves, and that was the last thing I wanted to do with whatever had warped the Godmother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could reply, we&amp;#39;d crossed the short distance from the train and broke through the treeline. Suddenly, we were surrounded by flashing lights, roaring rides, and jumbled-up voices everywhere. This wasn&amp;#39;t just a carnival, it was a carni&lt;em&gt;vale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the previous dream had been sparsely populated, this one was bursting with toons. And, where the previous dream&amp;#39;s occupants avoided each other in the fog, these ones got right up in each other&amp;#39;s faces, passing around food, shouting to be be heard over the rides, punching each other for small slights, and punctuated by criers for shows and booths. There were just as many fallen objects as in the previous dream, though, but this was because all the toons kept dropping popcorn and wrappers and cheap souvenirs into the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday had been so quiet, with such a wide berth between the toons I ran into. This was so much the opposite that I now felt claustrophobic. Based on the way Brer Fox&amp;#39;s fur spiked up and his tail twitched, he probably felt the same; the woods he lived in with Brer Bear probably had a much smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;d thought, though, this was a heavily expanded version of Dinoland, USA, which was on the opposite end of Animal Kingdom in real life. There was the giant (or, I guess, life sized?) longneck dinosaur sculpture that towered above the area, except, unlike in the real park, this one was moving around, lowering its neck to chat with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the mousetrap ride, Primeval Whirl, one one side, and and the triceratops Dumbo ride on the other. Between them, though, was the arcade from Main Street in Magic Kingdom. Toy Story Mania from Hollywood Studios sat behind that. Then there was a line of street food stands from several parts of Epcot. The strangest things, though, were the booths I didn&amp;#39;t recognize. A miniature museum, with a stand of breakable objects to toss at its windows, like glass bottles and ceramic teacups. A Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round... it wasn&amp;#39;t until I saw the giant clown balloon pass by that I finally got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is Pleasure Island??&amp;quot; My mouth dropped, and I could barely believe what was coming out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s what now?&amp;quot; Brer Fox didn&amp;#39;t see the significance of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pleasure Island!&amp;quot; I repeated, then felt dumb, because repeating things never made people understand things better. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a place from an old movie. This isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; it, but it&amp;#39;s definitely been &lt;em&gt;merged&lt;/em&gt; with it. This... this completely changes things!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned to the fox, whose eyes were not lighting up with the shock that I felt. &amp;quot;You gonna explain that er what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was really hard when my brain was running a mile a minute, but I had to try to slow down my thoughts so that he could catch up. &amp;quot;Brer, up until now, I thought that the Jabberwocky was lying when he said enough human dreams could bring you guys home. Like, that was part of his scheme for manipulating everyone. But, look at this!&amp;quot; I waved my hands around, and &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; the fox&amp;#39;s eyebrows were beginning to raise. &amp;quot;This was only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; level below our dream, and it&amp;#39;s already merging with a cartoon. The other parts of this dream could be merged with different parts of that movie, or with different stories altogether. He&amp;#39;s bringing the stories &lt;em&gt;here,&lt;/em&gt; just like he brought &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; here. Why? What&amp;#39;s the point?&amp;quot; I flapped my arms, unable to focus on making specific gestures anymore. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t decide if this is good or &lt;em&gt;really, really bad!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brer Fox&amp;#39;s eyes widened as I spoke, then he looked around again, new understanding in his eyes. &amp;quot;...I don&amp;#39;t like that,&amp;quot; he finally decided. &amp;quot;Places ain&amp;#39;t alive like people, they don&amp;#39;t know they ain&amp;#39;t coming out right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard to parse that, but somehow, I had to agree. This felt wrong all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stood there a moment, absorbing the weirdness that was the jigsaw fair. Then one of the toons ran past, sending a wave of sticky, cinnamon nuts over us, and our shock was broken. It took another few minutes of rabid yanking to get the candy out of our fur, which left us sore and cranky, but at least it didn&amp;#39;t stick to our new clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing in one place probably wasn&amp;#39;t a good idea if we didn&amp;#39;t want to draw attention, especially given how I was shouting about the Jabberwocky, but thankfully, we&amp;#39;d been close enough to the trees not to pull any eyes our way. We didn&amp;#39;t want to test our luck, though, so we started making our way through the crowd. This was where my Theme Park Skills(TM) finally became useful, as I kept a hand on Brer Fox&amp;#39;s wrist and wove around the clusters of people. This made us a short, but unbreakable, line, especially when a few toons tried to run between us and my friend dug his claws into my spats-braces, clotheslining the brats before they could separate us. Seriously, where was their crowd etiquette? I guess if they were some of the kids from the movie&amp;#39;s Pleasure Island, they probably didn&amp;#39;t even know what etiquette was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a free space behind one of the popcorn stands, and we did a quick huddle there. If we were going to get information, we had to have a gameplan. I pointed at the Toy Story Mania ride, which was just barely visible in the throngs of people. &amp;quot;The characters from that movie are pretty friendly, they might be more willing to help us out than the characters from Pleasure Island.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whatever gets me outta this lake a&amp;#39;loonies,&amp;quot; Brer Fox growled. Someone stepped on his tail as they ran by, and he rounded on them, baring his teeth in a snarl. The toon screamed and fled into the crowd, disappearing from sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept our grip on each other&amp;#39;s wrists as we pushed towards the ride, elbows locked in front of us to divert annoying people away from our center of mass. At some point I stepped in something sticky, probably soda, and stumbled a little in my disgust. Brer Fox hit my back and I made myself keep walking, gagging and sliding my paw against the grass, which only somewhat assuaged the grossness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached the big, cardboard cutouts that marked the ride&amp;#39;s entrance. In the real world, these were more of the moulded cement that Disney was so good at making, but here, they were actual cardboard. Hand-painted carnival pictures lined the material, and we slid into the entry queue for the line. I was intending to wait in line like a polite person, but evidently, my friend was &lt;em&gt;not.&lt;/em&gt; When I stopped moving, he ran up behind me, tossed me over his shoulder (I &lt;em&gt;shouted,&lt;/em&gt; I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; squeak like a rubber ducky), and vaulted over all the guide rails like an angry Olympian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He dumped me on the ground at the front door, then, without giving me time to recover, grabbed my arm and dragged me to my feet, pulling me inside and slamming the door shut. He slumped against the door, breathing raggedly, fur spiking with anxiety-static.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wow. He must have &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; had claustrophobia. I would have to keep that in mind the next time we were in a tight space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to comfort him would probably make him feel worse, as much as I would rather talk the feelings out myself, so with some restraint, I patted his shoulder and turned to look at the shooting gallery instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really should have expected this, considering the only ride I&amp;#39;d been on in this reality had been the train, but the ride was no longer a ride. It was an actual galleria, with multiple levels, and a big, open space in the middle where a bunch of stairs ran down to the bottom. I leaned over the railing, trying to see how many floors down the place went, awed by how big it was. On every wall was a separate gallery, with Toy Story characters laughing and heckling the guests as they tossed targets or steered conveyor belts. Dozens of waist-high, green soldiers (finally toons that were shorter than me!) ran to and fro, climbing up the stairs or parachuting down them, carrying new bins of the rubbish discusses that were the staple here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; guys looked like they were having a good time. I wondered if they even knew about the problems outside this little world, about the shadow monsters creeping up on everything. I wondered if any of them had been tainted like the Godmother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Um, excuse me!&amp;quot; I tried to wave down one of the army men passing by. He ignored me. &amp;quot;Hello, could you--&amp;quot; I tapped another on the shoulder, and he shrugged me off. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hey,&lt;/em&gt; I need help here!&amp;quot; Nobody would look at me. They were all too single-minded in maintaining the galleria. Enough so that it got my suspicion senses tingling. Normally, the soldiers in the movies were pretty gung-ho about helping the others, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an aggravated sigh, I turned back to Brer Fox. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going to have to search through this mess for someone who will talk to us. Sorry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fox made a noise between a growl and a hiss, pressing closer to the door, which was beginning to rattle with the fists of the people he&amp;#39;d locked outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rubbed the back of my neck, glancing between him and the galleria. &amp;quot;Would you prefer staying here while I did the searching?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You crazy?&amp;quot; he snapped. &amp;quot;We ain&amp;#39;t splitting up here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, good. Even if he hadn&amp;#39;t ever read a horror story before, he was still genre savvy enough to know that splitting up was a bad idea. I held out my arm, and he griped a moment before grabbing my wrist again, and we started once more weaving through the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I tried getting the attention of the toys in the booths. Most of them were too focused on making more targets and then ducking out of the way to see the results, shouting insults or encouragement, depending. Because we weren&amp;#39;t doing the shooting, we couldn&amp;#39;t catch their eyes. Mrs. Potato Head gave us a concerned look while her husband heckled a particularly clumsy toon, but she still didn&amp;#39;t come over, no matter how hard I waved. I supposed that was smart, considering what kind of toons probably frequented here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claw-game aliens were just as single-minded as the soldiers were, which was worrisome. They only said their catch phrases, &amp;quot;oooo,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the claawwwww,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;we are eternally grateful!&amp;quot; over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, quite a few of the toys were like that. Stinky Pete was saying generally villainous lines without any heart in them. Trixie grinned at us wordlessly, with decidedly plastic eyes. Jessie jumped around, hooting and hollering, with much more life in her, but when the army men came to sweep up the debris and refill the discuss stocks, she just stood in the back, stiff and blank. The more I looked for someone who could help us, the more I became disheartened. Were any of these people alive, or were they just illusions made by the ride? Or, worse, were they alive and tainted in the same way the Godmother was? Heck, Mrs. Potato Head&amp;#39;s concern might have just been her default face between watching guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I&amp;#39;d been kind of happy for these guys; unlike the other toons we&amp;#39;d met, they all had each other. They were all together in this, and having fun. But, now? Now, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I was looking at toons, or moving corpses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Brer Fox grew more agitated by the crowds, I grew more desperate, going down floor after floor to find somebody, &lt;em&gt;anybody&lt;/em&gt; we could talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the people in the crowd were familiar. They were all background faces in the movies; kids from Pleasure Island and animal anthros from any number of movies, maybe Zootopia or Robin Hood. It wasn&amp;#39;t until we reached the fifth and final sub-level of the galleria that I finally saw someone I knew. Leaning against Ham&amp;#39;s booth, almost tucked behind it, was a figure mostly noticeable because he was taller than the average child, bunny, or turtle scurrying by his feet. He was tossing a coin in one hand and examining the crowd with shifty eyes, a sleazy smile on a vulpine snout that was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; different enough from my companion&amp;#39;s to be extremely uncomfortable. They had been drawn in very different styles, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other fox noticed that someone was staring at him, and his eyes met mine, narrowing in thought. He caught the coin and shoved it in his coat pocket, slipping further behind the booth and out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shuddered in disgust. I&amp;#39;d been hoping to find somebody &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; to talk to. Of call the people here who might have information for me, why did the first one to notice us have to be &lt;em&gt;John Foulfellow??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was going to suck.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I first started having these experiences when I was approaching the end of fourth grade. I had only just turned ten when my family decided to move to a new house. My family has always been moving almost constantly since I was 5. Every house that we moved to had me scared at first, but that was only because it was a new place with new surroundings and things to get used to. Yet this house had me scared for another reason. To me it was creepy not only with the several secret doors that the previous owner had told us not to open but also the creaking floorboards with almost every step anywhere on the second floor. Not to mention the thick woods surrounding our entire house. Now this isn’t your cliche horror movie house that has had three people die in it and that it has been abandoned for a century. This house is only about thirty years old and no deaths we were told about, just a normal looking house you would see driving down the street.

 There was just one more thing that kind of creeped me out a little bit at night and it was my room. It was the biggest bedroom besides the masters bedroom and it was full of life sized realistic paintings of animals such as zebras, giraffes, and tigers on my walls. At first all that may not seem bad but then I suffered a little bit from sleep paralysis and many nightmares so you could see how life sized wall paintings in a pitch dark room could creep me out when I wake up knowing nothing of what's going on

I had asked my mom if we could get a different house because this one was kind of crappy anyway. She responded with a no and that this is the only house in the area that we can afford that will fit all of us. When I told her that this house is creepy to me but she convinced me that it was in my head and that I was overreacting. I believed that everything was in my head as well since everything went fairly well for me beside all the nightmares and stuff. One thing that I forgot to mention is that nobody in my family believes in ghosts and I didn’t either until about two months after living at our new home. 

Since this day is burned in my memory as one of my most scary experiences that i've ever had I can still remember most of what happened. It was a school night and was somewhere between 1:30-2:00 when I got up with a sudden urge to go to the bathroom. Being the inconsiderate ten-year old that I was I stomped all the way to the bathroom. The whole way there I felt like I was being watched but I got that feeling a lot all the way up till now so I brushed it off. When I came out, hands still wet from not using the towel, I started walking to my room and was only halfway there when I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw some sort of figure standing in my room.

 I couldn't make out exactly what it was. I thought it might be one of those paintings butI could make out it was some human-like figure. Not knowing what to do I stood there stunned out of fear like a deer in headlights. I stood there for probably ten seconds but It felt like minutes until the figure turned around and saw me. It stared at me for a few seconds until turning away and walking out of sight. After The figure was gone instead of going to tell my parents I decided to go confront whatever it was thinking I could take whatever the thing was with a pocket knife that I got from boy scouts. When I got in there I ran and grabbed my knife from my nightstand. I looked everywhere and couldn’t find anything, but then I remembered my closet. I didn’t realise It at that moment that I was shaking uncontrollably and with each step I took it only felt like It made my blood sink more. As I got closer I kept wanting to go back to sleep and forget about it but it was like my legs only kept walking closer. Before I knew It I was opening the closet. With one final deep breath I awaited what met me on the other side. When It was open I looked inside everywhere and every corner. Nothing, there was nothing in the closet. I didn’t know how that was possible because there was nowhere else where anything could hide. I haven’t thought much of the incident at all since It’s been so long. Anything else that I can remember are from the span of two years and were small occurrences such as toys going off and moving out of nowhere, hearing my name called when nobody else but me is home, and most disturbing out of the few hearing creaking floorboards along with faint footsteps on the second floor. 

The event that happened was two days ago and is also what awakened these horrible past memories from three years ago. It was 11:24 and my parents went to sleep ten minutes ago when my door burst open with a force. Like I said before It has been four years since the first experience I had with a paranormal being so I thought that It was a prank from my younger brother but when I checked in his room he was asleep. After all of this happening it is safe to say that I got a lot more interested in the paranormal and started researching stuff about them. All thought I have gotten a lot less scared with these things I just hope that I never run into that figure again.",t2_53k6oxvf,False,,0,False,I moved into a new house 5 years ago and Iv'e Been Noticing Some Strange Things.,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fh8h40,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1584005853.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first started having these experiences when I was approaching the end of fourth grade.

As I got closer I kept wanting to go back to sleep and forget about it but it was like my legs only kept walking closer. Before I knew It I was opening the closet. With one final deep breath I awaited what met me on the other side. When It was open I looked inside everywhere and every corner. Nothing, there was nothing in the closet. I didn’t know how that was possible because there was nowhere else where anything could hide. I haven’t thought much of the incident at all since It’s been so long. Anything else that I can remember are from the span of two years and were small occurrences such as toys going off and moving out of nowhere, hearing my name called when nobody else but me is home, and most disturbing out of the few hearing creaking floorboards along with faint footsteps on the second floor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event that happened was two days ago and is also what awakened these horrible past memories from three years ago. It was 11:24 and my parents went to sleep ten minutes ago when my door burst open with a force. Like I said before It has been four years since the first experience I had with a paranormal being so I thought that It was a prank from my younger brother but when I checked in his room he was asleep. After all of this happening it is safe to say that I got a lot more interested in the paranormal and started researching stuff about them. All thought I have gotten a lot less scared with these things I just hope that I never run into that figure again.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"""Eva? Have you fed the dogs yet?""


""No, Mother,"" I reply.


""Go and do that before supper, Eva. You know what happens when they go hungry.""


""Yes, Mother,"" I call back, but my voice is empty. She isn't my real mother. I'm not her daughter. I'm more of a prisoner than anything, trapped in this house at the end of the road where hardly anyone comes to visit. And on the rare days when someone does drop in, they never make it out.


Each step I take towards the kitchen feels like a mile, and my feet are sluggish, barely moving. It's been too long since I've eaten, too long since I've had a fix, and Mother knows that. She knows that the feeding will only wet my appetite, will only make me hungrier for something I refuse to eat. She knows it, and I know it. But I can't defy her like Jackson did. I'm not as strong as he was.


I reach the kitchen and pull open the door with a groan, the heavy oak door swinging open to reveal the backyard covered in snow as the cold bites at my naked body. Farther away towards the far fence, two big, black dogs stare at me with hungry eyes as I cross over to the freezer by the side of the house. I can feel their eyes on me as I pull it open and reach inside, gagging back the vomit that rises in my throat as the smell hits me. It hits them too, and drives them into a frenzy. They bark at me, growl, whine, run at me until their chains snap them back. They smell what's in the freezer, and they want it badly. I do too.


I take out the bucket and close the freezer before I make my way over to the dogs. It's taking everything I can manage just to make it over there without sinking to my knees, but somehow I make it. I toss the bucket's contents to the dogs, and the snow turns red as bits of flesh and skin-covered bones suddenly litter the lawn. The dogs pounce, devouring the meat and the fat and the flesh with reckless, savage hunger. It's all I can manage to turn away in revulsion. I hate it, I hate them, but I hate myself even more because deep down, part of me wants to throw myself onto the snow with them and force the meat into my mouth like an animal. I need to feed, and I hate that I need it. I need the fix. Badly.


I stagger back inside as the dogs lap up the last bits of Jackson, and I close the door behind me to shut out their snarls and barks. I try to close the door on my own regret as well, but that's something I can't manage. Every day I've gone out to feed them, I've wondered if things would have turned out differently if I had tried to leave with him. Maybe Mother wouldn't have caught him. Maybe one of us could have made it out.


Those thoughts and regrets leave my mind as I stumble into the dining room, and this time, my strength does give way. I crumple to my knees just a few steps away from the table, and I suddenly can't breathe. I claw at the collar around my neck as I gasp for air, as my stomach churns and aches, as my mind screams at me to eat, to eat, to eat to eat to eat to eat to eat to eat to eat.


""Eva, dear, supper's ready,"" Mother says softly as she stands from her chair at the table's head and bends down beside me, cradling my head in her lap as I writhe and scream. She doesn't hear me, and I can't tune her out.


""Come on, dear, just have a bit. This is what happens when you skip meals. I warned you.""


My teeth gnash together and my joints lock up, my body suddenly going rigid. I'm convulsing on the floor as she strokes my hair away from my face and whispers quiet, soothing reassurance to me. I can almost imagine she's a real mother in that moment. I can almost imagine that everything is going to be okay. Then the pain rushes back in, and I can't take it anymore.


""I'll… eat,"" I manage to rhasp out, and Mother caresses my cheeks lovingly.


""I knew you would, dear,"" she purrs, and I can actually hear the smile in her voice. She holds something up to my lips then, forces it passed my clenched teeth, and liquid rushes into my mouth. 


I swallow mouthful after mouthful, eyes squeezed shut as I try to ignore the metallic taste of someone else's blood in my mouth, in my throat, in my stomach. I can't ignore it and I can't forgive myself, but it does its job. After a few moments, the convulsing stops. After a minute, the bottle is pulled away from my mouth and I have enough strength to sit up and face Mother for the main meal.


She smiles at me when I meet her eyes, and the stolen face of my real mother that she wears as a mask stretches thin. The rotted, gaping human skin barely covers Mother's true face anymore, but she likes to wear it to remind me of everything that's happened. I can see the black, charred bone and muscle underneath the mask, the flesh that is Mother's real face, and I look away. I don't want to see it anymore. I don't want to see my meal.


""Eva, look at me, dear.""


I am unable to disobey. My head turns against my will and I watch in panic as Mother holds up a butcher's knife from the kitchen and carefully digs the blade into her naked stomach, black liquid oozing out from the charred flesh. I'm unable to turn away as she carves the blade through her body, cutting out a piece of herself and holding out the bloody, warm mess of meat to me with that smile still stretched across the face that isn't hers.


I can't resist anymore. I lunge at her, snarling like an animal as I sink my teeth into the fresh meal and rip into the juicy, bitter meat. Mother simply smiles at me and rubs my bare back as I devour her flesh, happily whispering to me as I feed.


She's gone now, retreated back underneath the house in happy contentment. I lay in the dining room with blood caked around my mouth and regret rushing through me. I can't stop. She won't let me stop. I've tried to resist, but each time I inevitably relapse, it only strengthens the addiction. And with every bite I take, I can feel myself changing. I'm becoming what Mother wants me to be, my body morphing and my appetite growing. She won't ever let me go, and now, I'm terrified that my body won't let me leave. There's still more to feed on. There's still more Mother can give.


And now I lay here in the dark, waiting for Mother to bring me my next meal.",t2_mhhyrcm,False,,0,False,Mother,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fge70o,False,dark,,public,2055,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2055,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 3},['writing'],True,,1583877421.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Eva?

,nosleep,"Noah had broken up with me after three years over some reason that I still wasn’t very clear on, and to make matters a little bit worse, he had dumped me for my best friend Camila. I had lost a boyfriend, and a close childhood friend, all on the same day, and then, I had fallen and scraped my left arm on a brick fence because I was crying so much that I didn’t see the abandoned skateboard on the sidewalk and tripped over it.

So, I guess you could say I was in quite a bit of pain, even if it wasn’t all physical.

It was a conflicting mix of feelings to have. On one hand, there was the pain from the scrapes on my arm; this pain I could see the reason for. On the other hand, I couldn’t see the reason for the weight on my chest or the butterflies in the pit of my stomach. But pain is pain, right?

After keeping myself isolated in bed for two days, I finally decided to do something else instead of wallowing in my pain.

My first idea was to go for a walk. I went alone, sneaking out before my dog Milo saw me, as I wasn’t ready to be with anyone quite yet. I left my house late in the morning and headed towards the woods across the road. I knew a lot of people walked through there on a regular basis, although usually in the evening, but again, I was looking forward to being alone for a bit longer.

I walked through the overgrown grass, my sneakers crunching down on dry leaves every time I took a step. I could hear birds singing, and occasional buzzing from insects that flew past me. It was a bit colder here since it was mostly shady; the sun poking through occasionally, and I was glad I had decided to wear a sweater.

I don’t know how long I walked before I came to the realization that I was probably lost.

I stood in the middle of a small clearing---one of the places where the sun managed to trespass the trees--- and looked around, trying to figure out which direction would lead me back home. I thought that I had probably been walking in a straight line anyway, so after a few seconds, I decided to simply turn around and walk back that way.

I kept telling myself that I was going the right way because I recognized the tree branch that covered part of my path, but the truth was that I was grasping at straws at this point.

I kept walking and I eventually found myself back on the road. I was relieved for a moment before I realized that something was off.

For starters, my house wasn’t across the road where it should have been. Actually, there weren’t any houses here at all. The road simply separated the woods from a large field of flowers that I had never seen before.

It was also warmer here; warm enough for me to roll up the sleeves of my sweater. I flinched as I pushed up my left sleeve, but then I noticed that it no longer hurt.

I looked down at my arm and the scrapes were still there; angry, red, and beginning to scab, but they no longer hurt. I went one step further and rand my fingers down my arm, pressing down slightly. But still, no pain.

I looked back up towards the field as a breeze blew in my direction, carrying the smell of the flowers with it and into my nose. I took a deep breath as the scent hit me; it was much sweeter than any flower I had ever smelled before; almost artificial.

As I took another deep breath, I noticed that the heaviness in my chest was gone. I could actually breathe again.

I walked towards the field, taking cautious steps to make sure that I didn’t crush any of the flowers. The smell of the flowers intensified; but not in a bad way.

I wasn’t sure where I was, but there was something different about this place. I felt different; happier, free, more like myself. Even when I thought about Noah leaving me for Camila, I didn’t feel angry or sad; I felt okay. I felt good.

As I walked further into the field, I realized it was at a bit on an incline, and once I reached the top, I had a view of everything around me.

This was certainly not my neighborhood, and likely also not my town. The field stretched as far as I could see, the woods remaining to my left. A hummingbird darted past me as I stood there in the middle of the field.

Under normal circumstances, I think I would have been worried, but there was something about this place that took all of that away somehow.

I didn’t stay there for long. After a few minutes, I walked back into the woods, once again attempting to find my way home. I managed to find it when I heard a car drive past and walked in the direction of the sound until I stepped through the trees and saw my house across the street. As I walked across the road, I noticed that it was a bit chilly once again, and pulled down the sleeves of my sweater.

I gasped as my left sleeve touched the scrapes on my arm. This time it hurt, as expected. That’s when I made the connection, but what was it about that place that took my pain away?

As I thought about this, I could feel everything creeping its way back in. First I noticed I felt less peaceful as my chest felt tight and crushed again. The butterflies in my stomach fluttered awake again and I started to feel nauseous and anxious as my hands got sweaty and cold and my heart began to pound in my chest.

Oddly, I slept well that night. The next morning, however, things got a little bit worse when I heard from Missy that Camila was actually three months pregnant with Noah’s baby.

I felt like someone had pulled the rug out from under my feet, knocking the wind out of me as my world flipped upside down.

That afternoon I ran back into the woods, and surprisingly found the field again.

As soon as I stepped through I felt a rush of peace again, and nothing mattered anymore. Not the cheating, not the pregnancy, not the scrapes on my arm.

I stayed there a bit longer this time, laying in the field on my back with my eyes closed, breathing in the smell of the flowers.

Once I felt like I had calmed down enough I got up and walked back home. Stepping back into my ‘regular” world was like a punch in the gut as all the feelings came flooding back once again.

I didn’t sleep at all that night. I had nightmare after nightmare; I was running through the woods, running from something that I couldn’t see, but that I could feel looming over me, heavy like humidity after a hot and rainy summer day. No matter how fast I ran, or in what direction I went, I could not find the field.

The next morning I got up before sunrise, planning on spending my entire morning in the field. I let Milo out to do his business first, and when I walked back out to get him, I found him dead in the middle of the road. I doubled over on the side of the road, feeling sick, but there was nothing in my stomach for me to throw up.

I ran into the woods until I stepped through into the other side, where the feelings evaporated once again.

I fell asleep in the field, and then reluctantly made my way back. When I stepped out into the road, I felt exhausted. Milo wasn’t in the middle of the road anymore, but I knew that he also wasn’t alive.

I sulked in my house for the rest of the day, once again finding myself attached to my bed.

At 5:23 pm I got the call. My sister Darcy was in a bad car accident and was in a coma. I didn’t get out of bed to go see her. I lied and told my mom that I was busy and I would make it down the next morning.

The next morning I still didn’t get out of bed. I couldn’t go to the field either since a thunderstorm blew in, and so I laid in my bed, in the dark, listening to the sound of rain falling on the roof of my house while I cried myself to sleep on and off throughout the day.

The few minutes of sleep that I got were riddled with versions of the same nightmare from before, only this time I could feel pain all over my whole body as I ran from something that I couldn’t see. Each time I fell asleep, I would fall back into the same nightmare, and each time I did, the thing that followed me got closer and closer until I felt like I was being suffocated by the thing that I still could not see.

The next morning at 4 am, I got up and walked across the road, wrapped up in a blanket. I made it to the field and simply sat there, taking deep breaths and I appreciated the fact that I couldn’t feel anything at all.

My face felt tight from the tears that had been steadily streaming down my face all night. There was a lump in my throat, but besides that, I felt okay. Not good, but okay, and for the time being, okay was enough.

I suddenly remembered Darcy, and how I had promised my mom that I would be there today. I got up and ran through the woods again, throwing the blanket off as I walked into the house. I grabbed my phone off my bedside table and saw the ten missed calls from my mom, along with more than twenty text messages. I scrolled through the text messages first.

Darcy had died early this morning while I was in the field, instead of at the hospital like I had said.

I stared at the text message that my mom had sent, wondering where I was until my vision became blurry from the tears in my eyes.

How had I managed to screw everything up?

I knew the answer to this of course; it was because of the field. More specifically, because I was running to the field and away from my pain as if that was going to somehow fix everything.

I wanted so badly to blame the field, but it wasn’t at fault; I was. There wasn’t really much I could do now except face the mess that I was in.

I felt a familiar feeling as I stood there, alone in the darkness of my house. It was the same feeling that I had in my nightmare. There was one thing that was different though; this time, I didn’t feel like I was running away from something, I felt like it had finally caught up to me.

I thought that I had probably been walking in a straight line anyway, so after a few seconds, I decided to simply turn around and walk back that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept telling myself that I was going the right way because I recognized the tree branch that covered part of my path, but the truth was that I was grasping at straws at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept walking and I eventually found myself back on the road. I was relieved for a moment before I realized that something was off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, my house wasn’t across the road where it should have been. Actually, there weren’t any houses here at all. The road simply separated the woods from a large field of flowers that I had never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also warmer here; warm enough for me to roll up the sleeves of my sweater. I flinched as I pushed up my left sleeve, but then I noticed that it no longer hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked down at my arm and the scrapes were still there; angry, red, and beginning to scab, but they no longer hurt. I went one step further and rand my fingers down my arm, pressing down slightly. But still, no pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked back up towards the field as a breeze blew in my direction, carrying the smell of the flowers with it and into my nose. I took a deep breath as the scent hit me; it was much sweeter than any flower I had ever smelled before; almost artificial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I took another deep breath, I noticed that the heaviness in my chest was gone. I could actually breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked towards the field, taking cautious steps to make sure that I didn’t crush any of the flowers. The smell of the flowers intensified; but not in a bad way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure where I was, but there was something different about this place. I felt different; happier, free, more like myself. Even when I thought about Noah leaving me for Camila, I didn’t feel angry or sad; I felt okay. I felt good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked further into the field, I realized it was at a bit on an incline, and once I reached the top, I had a view of everything around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was certainly not my neighborhood, and likely also not my town. The field stretched as far as I could see, the woods remaining to my left. A hummingbird darted past me as I stood there in the middle of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, I think I would have been worried, but there was something about this place that took all of that away somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t stay there for long. After a few minutes, I walked back into the woods, once again attempting to find my way home. I managed to find it when I heard a car drive past and walked in the direction of the sound until I stepped through the trees and saw my house across the street. As I walked across the road, I noticed that it was a bit chilly once again, and pulled down the sleeves of my sweater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gasped as my left sleeve touched the scrapes on my arm. This time it hurt, as expected. That’s when I made the connection, but what was it about that place that took my pain away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I thought about this, I could feel everything creeping its way back in. First I noticed I felt less peaceful as my chest felt tight and crushed again. The butterflies in my stomach fluttered awake again and I started to feel nauseous and anxious as my hands got sweaty and cold and my heart began to pound in my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly, I slept well that night. The next morning, however, things got a little bit worse when I heard from Missy that Camila was actually three months pregnant with Noah’s baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like someone had pulled the rug out from under my feet, knocking the wind out of me as my world flipped upside down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That afternoon I ran back into the woods, and surprisingly found the field again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I stepped through I felt a rush of peace again, and nothing mattered anymore. Not the cheating, not the pregnancy, not the scrapes on my arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed there a bit longer this time, laying in the field on my back with my eyes closed, breathing in the smell of the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I felt like I had calmed down enough I got up and walked back home. Stepping back into my ‘regular” world was like a punch in the gut as all the feelings came flooding back once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t sleep at all that night. I had nightmare after nightmare; I was running through the woods, running from something that I couldn’t see, but that I could feel looming over me, heavy like humidity after a hot and rainy summer day. No matter how fast I ran, or in what direction I went, I could not find the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I got up before sunrise, planning on spending my entire morning in the field. I let Milo out to do his business first, and when I walked back out to get him, I found him dead in the middle of the road. I doubled over on the side of the road, feeling sick, but there was nothing in my stomach for me to throw up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into the woods until I stepped through into the other side, where the feelings evaporated once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell asleep in the field, and then reluctantly made my way back. When I stepped out into the road, I felt exhausted. Milo wasn’t in the middle of the road anymore, but I knew that he also wasn’t alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sulked in my house for the rest of the day, once again finding myself attached to my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 5:23 pm I got the call. My sister Darcy was in a bad car accident and was in a coma. I didn’t get out of bed to go see her. I lied and told my mom that I was busy and I would make it down the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I still didn’t get out of bed. I couldn’t go to the field either since a thunderstorm blew in, and so I laid in my bed, in the dark, listening to the sound of rain falling on the roof of my house while I cried myself to sleep on and off throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few minutes of sleep that I got were riddled with versions of the same nightmare from before, only this time I could feel pain all over my whole body as I ran from something that I couldn’t see. Each time I fell asleep, I would fall back into the same nightmare, and each time I did, the thing that followed me got closer and closer until I felt like I was being suffocated by the thing that I still could not see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning at 4 am, I got up and walked across the road, wrapped up in a blanket. I made it to the field and simply sat there, taking deep breaths and I appreciated the fact that I couldn’t feel anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My face felt tight from the tears that had been steadily streaming down my face all night. There was a lump in my throat, but besides that, I felt okay. Not good, but okay, and for the time being, okay was enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suddenly remembered Darcy, and how I had promised my mom that I would be there today. I got up and ran through the woods again, throwing the blanket off as I walked into the house. I grabbed my phone off my bedside table and saw the ten missed calls from my mom, along with more than twenty text messages. I scrolled through the text messages first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darcy had died early this morning while I was in the field, instead of at the hospital like I had said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at the text message that my mom had sent, wondering where I was until my vision became blurry from the tears in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How had I managed to screw everything up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew the answer to this of course; it was because of the field. More specifically, because I was running to the field and away from my pain as if that was going to somehow fix everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted so badly to blame the field, but it wasn’t at fault; I was. There wasn’t really much I could do now except face the mess that I was in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a familiar feeling as I stood there, alone in the darkness of my house. It was the same feeling that I had in my nightmare. There was one thing that was different though; this time, I didn’t feel like I was running away from something, I felt like it had finally caught up to me.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a worldwide phenomenon, where the best competes for the best footage, who can get more viewers, who can get the best footage of the paranormal. Paranormal teams are all over world, breaking into abandon places and having expensive equipment that they all use to catch voices or footage of orbs, or shadow people. It’s very competitive if one was to really get into it, but what all paranormal teams will tell you is that they weren’t expecting it, and that they try to prove that ghosts or cryptids are real, that all the skeptics need to get off their high horses because the oceans haven’t been explored enough, a huge controversy that even aliens were real and helped build the pyramids. 

But what isn’t explored enough, paranormal phenomenons, teams that catch maybe angels, or a humanoid creature crawling like a spider and running after you down the hall. Unexplained screams that make the hair stand on edge. Not enough evidence that can prove these are real or not, footage can be faked, its why people are quick to explain away or say it as just a trick because they’d seen people faking their footage. 

“Dan! Hurry your ass!” Arron hisses at me as he had already half his body in the broken boarded window, he had to suck in his stomach to get through the hole big enough for one person. I ran after him, lugging all the equipment, basically a camera, a spirit box, a boo buddy, and EVP, a recorder, and holy water, and most importantly a flashlight. we were just starting out as a paranormal team, most of these things we had were borrowed, and I prayed we didn’t break any of it. 

Arron wanted to investigate the paranormal after he was pushed down a flight of stairs at his dorm, in his words he was pushed by invisible hands, and heard a growl in his ears right before he plummeted down the stairs and hit the bottom and had a broken arm because of it. he had told his story on Reddit and I took an interest, he got a lot of skeptics telling him he needed psychiatric help, others said that he made up the story of him just falling down the stairs on accident or on purpose depending on who responded. I had DM him and we got talking about the paranormal, I had always been in the paranormal. 

I was a beacon, for ghosts, I am a medium, I can see spirits in their full form, and shadow people, I’ve been told my entire life I had a mental condition, I had no one believe until now, Arron believed me and it felt good that I wasn’t really insane. We both had joked that we should be paranormal investigators, I agreed, next thing I know he’s at my front door with all this equipment with a big Cheshire cat grin on his face and told me he found a place in my hometown that would be a good start for our first investigation, I laughed, I thought he was kidding until he hauled me into his car and drove me to an abandon hospital. 

It used to be an insane asylum, but it was shut down after it was illegal to use patients for the experiments in lobotomy and it was converted into a hospital that was around for nearly forty years and when they got enough money had relocated to a better sight, there was reports that a lot of the paranormal activities happened here, Arron did his research that a lot of the night nurses would report about shadow people running down halls, they’d hear mysterious screaming, typical hauntings, and Arron wants to get it all on camera. 

But the one thing he’d told me that the real reason why the hospital relocated and left all its equipment inside was, that there was actually a monster here. apparently one of the nurses had gone missing and the only thing left of her was a pool of blood and her arm from her elbow down to her hand, that something was attacking the staff and patients and the police couldn’t find out who or what was killing, he wanted to prove this monster was real, because the police ruled it as a cold case because they couldn’t find the killer and in the reports was most likely to be a homeless man that was somehow getting in and out of the hospital from another entrance way. 

I pushed the duffle back through the crack of wood panels and then I squeezed myself in, I was skinny enough I didn’t need to suck my gut in, I glanced at Arron who’s eyes shun envy, he jutted his chin at the duffle bag, he still had a cast on that had a lot of signatures on it, some of them were insults not sure they were friends of his who done it, but I wasn’t going to ask. 

I kneeled down on the dusty floor, I got bearings of the room, I surveyed it, it was the lobby area, it was open to a two hallways like a fork in the road, it was dark, and quiet, how eerie it was to be in an abandoned hospital. Everything had a thick layer of dust, the only part of the dust disturbed was around us where our footprints were. 

I pulled out the camera and set it on night vision and pulled out a recorder and held it out to Arron who took it. he glanced around; he too looked a bit creeped out, but I can see the excitement in his blue eyes. I zipped the duffle bag back up and slung it over my shoulder and it hung down by my waist.

“so?” I asked him. 

“oh right,” he said and turned on the recorder, I turned on the camera and started to angle it at him, everything in the screen was casted in black and white. “I’m Arron and this is Dan, we are going to ask any of the entities that might still be lingering around,” he winked at the camera and continued. “Is there anyone here, if so its okay to say something anything?” He paused. “were you a patient here?” he paused again as if he was waiting for an answer, “do you have a name? how many entities are here?” he paused again and the stopped the recorder and played it back. 

The recorder repeated what he was saying until after he said it was okay to say something, a voice cracked over the recorder, a dark low gravelly voice, “*get out…*” it gave me the chills but it only fueled Arron who was grinning so hard. And the voice came back but with more of a sinister tone this time. “*you will die… leave now…”*

My body shivered and I glanced over his shoulder and I saw a black figure ran into one of the rooms and I gasped and nearly dropped the camera, Arron whipped around and searched the hall and turned to me with a frown, “what the hell? Did you see something?”

“I saw a shadow person run into one of the rooms.” I whispered. 

Arron nodded and started down the hall I pointed out and I followed right after him, he didn’t seem to care if we were in any danger, as we walked we both froze when we heard footsteps walking down the hall, it was in front of us, it was like who ever wore dress shoes and took every step had echoed in the hall. I tried to look down the dark hall, but it was far too dark for me to see anything, the darkness was all I could see. It looked like it was swallowing up the hall, even the camera didn’t pick up anything in the dark. The words of that voice resounded in my head.

Arron hurriedly fished his phone out of his pocket and turned on the flashlight on his phone and pointed it down the hall, but there was obviously no one there, it was an empty hall, he walked further down the hall with slow stride as if he was on the verge to bolt right back to me at any moment, when suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and I stiffened, I stopped breathing, I stood so still I was sure someone could confuse me as a statue. 

“*get out while you can…*” that same voice growled into my ear, I can feel their breath on the shell of my ear, and when it released me I let out a breath of air and whipped my body around with the camera shaking in my hands and I glanced around but of course it was so dark I couldn’t see anyone, but the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. just as I was about to take a step towards the other hall, I heard Arron screaming. 

I scrambled back around nearly letting the camera fall out of my clammy hands as I felt my own heartbeat thump into my chest so fast I swear I could see it though my shirt, but I didn’t see Arron at all, he was gone, the hall way was once again dark no light at the end of the darkened hall. I fumbled into my front pocket and pulled out a lighter and flicked it on and held it in front of me. 

“h-hello? Anyone there? Arron are you okay?” I called out, there was no answer, only silence. I started down the hall, and the more I walked slowly down the hall and was recording on the camera each of the rooms I passed that seemed to be empty all the while I was looking for Arron’s light or Arron himself to jump out and scare the crap out of me, I would probably need a change of pants if he did that, I was on edge already, we were warned to leave the hospital, not once but three times. 

My body trembled, hell I barely had a leash on my bladder, I hit the end of the hall that went off to two different halls, the right was dark just as the left was. I had no idea where Arron went, and he screamed out, if that wasn’t a call for help in my book I don’t’ know what was. 

I heard a whisper of a woman’s voice in my ear, “*go right…”*

I swallowed loudly in my throat and nodded, I hope it was a friendly ghost, usually ghosts don’t talk to me, I see them, and they just stare at me, although this is a hotspot for them, so my sixth sense was working in overdrive. As I walked and held the lighter up, because I was stupid enough to leave my cell phone in Arron’s car, it was my only light source, until it dawned on me that there might be a flashlight in the duffle bag. 

I stopped walking and unzipped the bag and rifled through it until my hand touched something vaguely familiar, cylindrical and smooth feel, and I pulled it out and to my relief it was a flash light I blew out the lighter that was already heating up, I don’t know if the myths of leaving a light lit for mor then five to ten minutes of it exploding was true, it hadn’t exploded on me yet. I turned on the flashlight and smiled until I looked in front of me and screamed and dropped the flashlight, it made a thwack sound when it hit the ground and rolled to the wall. 

My heart leapt out of my chest, there was a face in front of me when I turned on the flashlight, it was an elder man that wore one of those baby blue surgical face masks that ties around the doctors face, his eyes were black sockets, no life whatsoever in them, the light from the flashlight casted a sinister shadow across his face. I bent down to grab the flashlight with more reluctance then before and flashed the light around the hall but there was no one there, no Arron no creepy eyeless doctor. 

I faintly heard Arron screaming again down the hall, without thought I started running down the hall when something as a black mass came barreling at me I dodged just in time and heard the wall two feet away from me made a collision sound, against the wall and I noticed the yellow peeled paint wall had a dent in it and a black mass pulled its body away and turned to me, its red eyes glowed in the dark and when it smiled like the Cheshire cat, it showed me its pearly white shark teeth and opened its mouth and a slick oozing black forked tongue slid out of its mouth.

I started to back away from it ever so slowly ad froze, I didn’t want to turn my back to it, not one bit, but I heard Arron screaming in agonizing pain again in the distance, I felt my body in that fight and flight mode. We stared at one another down as if we both were waiting to see who would crack first him or me. I broke, it was me, I turned my back on it and started running, I felt the ground quaked under my feet as it ran after me, with each of its feet slamming on the floor, I felt the vibrations, I skidded as I turned a sharp corner I heard that skidding sound that a dog would make if they were skidding across a slippery floor and collided with a wall and the painful howling of the creature. 

I was breathing heavily as I kept running, I didn’t stop to look, I know I would be killed if I stopped now, I made it a point to barely glance at the sliver windows in each room to see if I can see Arron, but I couldn’t, and I couldn’t hear him anymore. There was slamming sounds behind me, I made the mistake glancing over my shoulder as I was struggling to run with a duffle bag full of equipment, and I screamed as I saw the black mass monster slamming into the walls out of control like a bull running after its victim in a bull run. 

I turned another corner, this hospital was a huge maze, I saw a set of stairs and took it, I ran up two stairs at a time to get to the next floor up, I leapt behind the wall and pressed my body against it and held my breath as the slamming stopped, I heard it coming up the stairs slowly, growling, I had turned my flashlight off and held the camera in my other hand I bit down on my bottom lip trying to stay as quiet as I could. it reached the top stairs and I could see how grotesque it was, close up, its face looked like a skull of a bull, its black flesh barely staying on and its red eyes scanned the area, when I heard something like glass shattering on the floor below, the creature snarled and ran back down the stairs and the sounds of thumping of its feet as it ran down to check out the shattering sound. 

“*I warned you… get out now…*” said the male gravely voice from before, it was next to my ear. I nearly jumped out of my own skin, thank god I had a good sense not to scream this time, or that creature would be back. I wasn’t sure if I could run again, my lungs burned from breathing hard, I wasn’t the athletic type, and I was surprised I outran that creature. 

“I need to find Arron then we’ll leave I promise,” I whispered to the spirit. 

“*leave him… he’s dead already… unless you want to follow him in his grave…”* he growled in my ear. 

I noticed an OR, the light on top that warned that it was in session caught my eye, I slowly crept to it, I reached for the door handle when sudden a hand grabbed the back of my hoodie and yanked me away so hard and threw me to the ground, I fell on my back and let out a whoosh of air out of my lungs, I lost grip on my camera and the flashlight went sliding across the floor. the last thing I saw was someone was crouching over me, another black mass, I couldn’t move, my head throbbed, and my unconsciousness won out and pulled me under and I blacked out.",t2_54whu2ya,False,,0,False,Paranormal Investigator hospital investigation Pt 1,[],r/nosleep,False,6,flair-series,0,False,t3_fh9c27,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Series,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1584009411.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a worldwide phenomenon, where the best competes for the best footage, who can get more viewers, who can get the best footage of the paranormal.

&lt;p&gt;The recorder repeated what he was saying until after he said it was okay to say something, a voice cracked over the recorder, a dark low gravelly voice, “&lt;em&gt;get out…&lt;/em&gt;” it gave me the chills but it only fueled Arron who was grinning so hard. And the voice came back but with more of a sinister tone this time. “&lt;em&gt;you will die… leave now…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body shivered and I glanced over his shoulder and I saw a black figure ran into one of the rooms and I gasped and nearly dropped the camera, Arron whipped around and searched the hall and turned to me with a frown, “what the hell? Did you see something?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw a shadow person run into one of the rooms.” I whispered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arron nodded and started down the hall I pointed out and I followed right after him, he didn’t seem to care if we were in any danger, as we walked we both froze when we heard footsteps walking down the hall, it was in front of us, it was like who ever wore dress shoes and took every step had echoed in the hall. I tried to look down the dark hall, but it was far too dark for me to see anything, the darkness was all I could see. It looked like it was swallowing up the hall, even the camera didn’t pick up anything in the dark. The words of that voice resounded in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arron hurriedly fished his phone out of his pocket and turned on the flashlight on his phone and pointed it down the hall, but there was obviously no one there, it was an empty hall, he walked further down the hall with slow stride as if he was on the verge to bolt right back to me at any moment, when suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and I stiffened, I stopped breathing, I stood so still I was sure someone could confuse me as a statue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;get out while you can…&lt;/em&gt;” that same voice growled into my ear, I can feel their breath on the shell of my ear, and when it released me I let out a breath of air and whipped my body around with the camera shaking in my hands and I glanced around but of course it was so dark I couldn’t see anyone, but the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. just as I was about to take a step towards the other hall, I heard Arron screaming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scrambled back around nearly letting the camera fall out of my clammy hands as I felt my own heartbeat thump into my chest so fast I swear I could see it though my shirt, but I didn’t see Arron at all, he was gone, the hall way was once again dark no light at the end of the darkened hall. I fumbled into my front pocket and pulled out a lighter and flicked it on and held it in front of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“h-hello? Anyone there? Arron are you okay?” I called out, there was no answer, only silence. I started down the hall, and the more I walked slowly down the hall and was recording on the camera each of the rooms I passed that seemed to be empty all the while I was looking for Arron’s light or Arron himself to jump out and scare the crap out of me, I would probably need a change of pants if he did that, I was on edge already, we were warned to leave the hospital, not once but three times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body trembled, hell I barely had a leash on my bladder, I hit the end of the hall that went off to two different halls, the right was dark just as the left was. I had no idea where Arron went, and he screamed out, if that wasn’t a call for help in my book I don’t’ know what was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard a whisper of a woman’s voice in my ear, “&lt;em&gt;go right…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swallowed loudly in my throat and nodded, I hope it was a friendly ghost, usually ghosts don’t talk to me, I see them, and they just stare at me, although this is a hotspot for them, so my sixth sense was working in overdrive. As I walked and held the lighter up, because I was stupid enough to leave my cell phone in Arron’s car, it was my only light source, until it dawned on me that there might be a flashlight in the duffle bag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped walking and unzipped the bag and rifled through it until my hand touched something vaguely familiar, cylindrical and smooth feel, and I pulled it out and to my relief it was a flash light I blew out the lighter that was already heating up, I don’t know if the myths of leaving a light lit for mor then five to ten minutes of it exploding was true, it hadn’t exploded on me yet. I turned on the flashlight and smiled until I looked in front of me and screamed and dropped the flashlight, it made a thwack sound when it hit the ground and rolled to the wall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart leapt out of my chest, there was a face in front of me when I turned on the flashlight, it was an elder man that wore one of those baby blue surgical face masks that ties around the doctors face, his eyes were black sockets, no life whatsoever in them, the light from the flashlight casted a sinister shadow across his face. I bent down to grab the flashlight with more reluctance then before and flashed the light around the hall but there was no one there, no Arron no creepy eyeless doctor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I faintly heard Arron screaming again down the hall, without thought I started running down the hall when something as a black mass came barreling at me I dodged just in time and heard the wall two feet away from me made a collision sound, against the wall and I noticed the yellow peeled paint wall had a dent in it and a black mass pulled its body away and turned to me, its red eyes glowed in the dark and when it smiled like the Cheshire cat, it showed me its pearly white shark teeth and opened its mouth and a slick oozing black forked tongue slid out of its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to back away from it ever so slowly ad froze, I didn’t want to turn my back to it, not one bit, but I heard Arron screaming in agonizing pain again in the distance, I felt my body in that fight and flight mode. We stared at one another down as if we both were waiting to see who would crack first him or me. I broke, it was me, I turned my back on it and started running, I felt the ground quaked under my feet as it ran after me, with each of its feet slamming on the floor, I felt the vibrations, I skidded as I turned a sharp corner I heard that skidding sound that a dog would make if they were skidding across a slippery floor and collided with a wall and the painful howling of the creature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavily as I kept running, I didn’t stop to look, I know I would be killed if I stopped now, I made it a point to barely glance at the sliver windows in each room to see if I can see Arron, but I couldn’t, and I couldn’t hear him anymore. There was slamming sounds behind me, I made the mistake glancing over my shoulder as I was struggling to run with a duffle bag full of equipment, and I screamed as I saw the black mass monster slamming into the walls out of control like a bull running after its victim in a bull run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned another corner, this hospital was a huge maze, I saw a set of stairs and took it, I ran up two stairs at a time to get to the next floor up, I leapt behind the wall and pressed my body against it and held my breath as the slamming stopped, I heard it coming up the stairs slowly, growling, I had turned my flashlight off and held the camera in my other hand I bit down on my bottom lip trying to stay as quiet as I could. it reached the top stairs and I could see how grotesque it was, close up, its face looked like a skull of a bull, its black flesh barely staying on and its red eyes scanned the area, when I heard something like glass shattering on the floor below, the creature snarled and ran back down the stairs and the sounds of thumping of its feet as it ran down to check out the shattering sound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I warned you… get out now…&lt;/em&gt;” said the male gravely voice from before, it was next to my ear. I nearly jumped out of my own skin, thank god I had a good sense not to scream this time, or that creature would be back. I wasn’t sure if I could run again, my lungs burned from breathing hard, I wasn’t the athletic type, and I was surprised I outran that creature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need to find Arron then we’ll leave I promise,” I whispered to the spirit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;leave him… he’s dead already… unless you want to follow him in his grave…”&lt;/em&gt; he growled in my ear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed an OR, the light on top that warned that it was in session caught my eye, I slowly crept to it, I reached for the door handle when sudden a hand grabbed the back of my hoodie and yanked me away so hard and threw me to the ground, I fell on my back and let out a whoosh of air out of my lungs, I lost grip on my camera and the flashlight went sliding across the floor. the last thing I saw was someone was crouching over me, another black mass, I couldn’t move, my head throbbed, and my unconsciousness won out and pulled me under and I blacked out.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I don’t know how to put in better words but I think that I have become the subject of a study. 

A study that I am conducting. Or at least, I used to.

The backstory I am about to give you, will probably make me sound like a horrible person and I don’t doubt that I am. I got so invested in finding the right answers that I shoved all ethical claims aside. In front of me all I could see were the possibilities of finding true answers to questions humanity could only dream to find out. I saw awards, fame and money but if I’m honest those weren’t even my main goals. I just couldn’t quench my thirst for knowledge. And it would have promised so much had we found the answers we were looking for with the study we conducted. 

A project that we called the watcheye experiment.

The base for our study was pretty simple. We had a problem we needed to solve and exactly the right resources to tackle it. Our department is funded by big co-operations as well as the government. You might think what we do sounds illegal as soon as I tell you what it is but we are actually under a lot more state support than you'd like to believe. And we are not the only ones. There are facilities like ours all over the world. 

The department I work in is the social department. As the social scientists of the research facility we mainly focus on how to improve society by making use of the subconscious. 

Something known as *liberaterian paternalism*. 

What it means is basically institutions giving regular people a soft push towards acting as better humans. Never by prohibiting or punishment. Instead we make sure that individuals act morally good and right voluntarily. 

We conducted many studies, some very promising and some turned out to be more disappointing. You can't always win but we were an ambitious group of people. The problem we were facing this time, the one we tried to tackle with the watcheye experiment was an ongoing question we received. To put it into more simple terms, what we tried to do was make individuals, regular human beings with a tendency to being criminal, not want to act like douchebags anymore. People who litter for no reason even if a trash can is nearby. Or smoke cigarettes even if there are young children around. Break and steal state property. Start fights with others out of boredom and beat their faces bloody. 

Just typical trashy behaviour. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course we’re not the first social scientists facing this issue and there are promising findings we were able to base our strategy on. A very simple solution has been proven to make individuals act more socially desirable.  Something as easy as putting up pictures of eyes. Just a photo of a big eye can be enough to make someone feel observed and that consequently makes them be cleaner, nicer or simply not act like a bum. Very easy. However only in theory because could you imagine a world where there is a photo of an eye in each corner? Or camera's? People would catch on eventually. They'd get used to them and it wouldn't work anymore. The base of the theory however was still interesting and it made us think in new opportunities. 

If you make someone feel watched, they feel the need to act morally correct. That was something we could work with. We just needed to find a way to make them feel observed at all times. As if they were always in a social setting where being polite and proper was expected to a degree. 

Who cares if it really changes them or if it is just an illusion to them, as long as it helps. That's the moral we worked with most of the time. That's the only thing that mattered as we were instructed.

Our facility is connected to an advanced tech department as well as chemists and biologists who work on projects you probably won't hear about for the next decades. State of the art technology and means; with their help we were able to create a substance that could mimic the feeling of being observed.

The watcheye substance. 

Just something to drink, like cough syrup. Completely non-invasive and the effects were presumed to be short-termed. 

It was exciting but none of us dared to try it as we didn't know whether there were side effects we hadn't found yet. So what we needed to do was test our new invention with a number of willing participants. From a pool of a particular target group, felons, criminals, troublemakers, we selected a random sample who received a decent compensation. First we ran them through a screening. Made sure there were no signs of mental health problems with them or their family, especially no schizophrenia or other schizoaffective personality disorders, no anxiety, no drug abusers. In general nobody with an already high level of paranoia. 

We are not monsters after all. 

Then we invited them to the laboratory and conducted interviews. Asked them about their day to day behavior. Showed them scenarios and asked how they would act in the situation. Like if they were at the beach with a can of soda, would they just leave it there or try to find a trash can?

Of course they all lied. Giving socially desirable bullshit answers was expected. But we needed to find a way to actually be able to prove if their behavior was changing or not. The substance would make them feel observed but we had no way of knowing if it actually made them act better. 

So we had to get *a* *little* invasive. All for the sake of science. The tech department built microscopic cameras and microphones into our participants which they weren’t aware of. We had to make sure that any feelings of being observed were due to the substance and not due to cameras. As I said, this experiment will make me sound like a horrible person but as I mentioned they were compensated generously and we could never have known what this substance would really do to them. The camera’s were harmless in comparison.

“Have you noticed something different in your surroundings?”

“Can you give an example?”

“On my sheet it says that you live together with a partner. Are they acting differently in any way?”

She started biting her nails, her gaze focused on the table between us. 

“He is having strange thoughts. He knows what I do all the time and he doesn’t seem to like it.”

“Has he made any comments that made you believe so?”

“No.” she started looking around the room. Anything not to make eye contact with me. “I can hear it.” She finally whispered. “I can hear his thoughts. And I know that he sees me everywhere I go. He wants to do something awful to me. He can see me now”

Jillian was one of our more stable participants. At least in the beginning. She had a tendency for reckless driving. Something we ought to change with the watcheye substance. Other than that she had her life in order for most parts meaning we didn’t expect a drastic change in her behaviour. That is until we started seeing with her eyes. Jillian lived together with her boyfriend, both of them were in their mid-twenties and on the outside they seemed like a decent couple but not only on one occasion did we observe domestic violence. I wish we could have intervened but all of this was top secret at that point and can you imagine how people would react if they found out that the government was funding research like this? That was when I still cared about that.

After that last interview with Jillian, she had been acting completely exemplary. When she drove her car, she did it with such a level of precision and carefulness, it was astonishing. She became the perfect conscientious person and even the domestic violence decreased. But Jillian also acted more paranoid. She hardly left her house anymore and would lock herself up in the bathroom. Not even her boyfriend was able to get her to talk.

This was not supposed to be a side effect though. The watcheye substance is designed in a way that doesn't make you feel controlled, it is supposed to give you the feeling of being in a social setting. A healthy participant should not be affected negatively by this in any way, except for a slightly increased stress levels and even that was rare.

But something went wrong. When I tuned into Jillian’s screen, I was looking at her bloody hands. We saw everything from her perspective so at first it was difficult to identify what was going on but after a moment we noticed the man lying on the ground. And the knife next to him. When we rewinded the footage, we saw the horrific process that had led to this point. Jillian was shouting at her boyfriend, pushing him away and it looked as if she was going to become violent towards him again. Something that seemed odd as she had been entirely peaceful since being dosed with the substance. First, she started mutilating herself, when the man tried to make her stop, she started attacking him. When he was unconscious she kept repeating something.

“Now you can’t see me”

This continued for a while. In theory we weren’t allowed to intervene but we called an ambulance anonymously. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Jillian only had a few small scars. We brought her to our facility for further check up after she was released from the hospital. The man was hurt severely but he survived. 

But as I mentioned before, Jillian was one of the more stable cases. Which is making me even more scared because after I went home last night, I noticed something different. On the walk to my car, I kept seeing shadows which I wrote down to being tired, or because I was looking at violent pictures all day. But it wouldn’t stop when I started driving. I had to stop at least ten times to check if there really wasn’t a person sitting behind me on the backseat. I could have sworn I saw someone in the mirrors but every time I turned around, I was alone. 

It continued when I got home, I thought I saw someone in front of my window. Then I heard a knock on the door but there was nobody outside. I told myself that I was imagining things. That I had been too focused on this study and now I was getting paranoid. But it simply wouldn’t stop. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t shower. I couldn’t do anything. Finally when I went to bed, I had to keep the lights on. Darkness only made it worse but it was no use either way because when I tried closing my eyes, I felt a crowd of people standing around me, watching me closely.

The following day at the research facility, I brought up the topic with a few of my colleagues. I mentioned feeling like somebody was following me to my car yesterday and that I kept noticing someone in the car with me to see whether anyone else was feeling strange since the experiment had started. They all assured me they were fine and that I was probably just exhausted. I started feeling more at ease until I spoke to Elija, one of the other leads in the project.

“It’s not that uncommon to start taking over side effects of participants. You see them on the screen all day, talk to them, write about them, don’t worry, you will be fine.” 

“Yeah, maybe I just need to cut back a little on the caffeine” I said with a forced smile on my face. 

“Yes that would definitely be healthier. You drink that stuff like water” he laughed. “But you know you can talk to me if you feel strange.” 

“Thanks, I honestly appreciate that. I’m just feeling weird” I said.

“Of course, I realize that this study can be a little draining. Did you feel like anything else was different yesterday? Well, except for some lady trying to get a free ride with you?” he said jokingly 

I laughed along and then made an excuse to leave. 

I had never mentioned that the person I noticed in my car was a [woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/).",t2_55ayqf02,False,,0,False,I’m part of an experiment.

First, she started mutilating herself, when the man tried to make her stop, she started attacking him. When he was unconscious she kept repeating something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now you can’t see me”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This continued for a while. In theory we weren’t allowed to intervene but we called an ambulance anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jillian only had a few small scars. We brought her to our facility for further check up after she was released from the hospital. The man was hurt severely but he survived. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I mentioned before, Jillian was one of the more stable cases. Which is making me even more scared because after I went home last night, I noticed something different. On the walk to my car, I kept seeing shadows which I wrote down to being tired, or because I was looking at violent pictures all day. But it wouldn’t stop when I started driving. I had to stop at least ten times to check if there really wasn’t a person sitting behind me on the backseat. I could have sworn I saw someone in the mirrors but every time I turned around, I was alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It continued when I got home, I thought I saw someone in front of my window. Then I heard a knock on the door but there was nobody outside. I told myself that I was imagining things. That I had been too focused on this study and now I was getting paranoid. But it simply wouldn’t stop. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t shower. I couldn’t do anything. Finally when I went to bed, I had to keep the lights on. Darkness only made it worse but it was no use either way because when I tried closing my eyes, I felt a crowd of people standing around me, watching me closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day at the research facility, I brought up the topic with a few of my colleagues. I mentioned feeling like somebody was following me to my car yesterday and that I kept noticing someone in the car with me to see whether anyone else was feeling strange since the experiment had started. They all assured me they were fine and that I was probably just exhausted. I started feeling more at ease until I spoke to Elija, one of the other leads in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that uncommon to start taking over side effects of participants. You see them on the screen all day, talk to them, write about them, don’t worry, you will be fine.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, maybe I just need to cut back a little on the caffeine” I said with a forced smile on my face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes that would definitely be healthier. You drink that stuff like water” he laughed. “But you know you can talk to me if you feel strange.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thanks, I honestly appreciate that. I’m just feeling weird” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course, I realize that this study can be a little draining. Did you feel like anything else was different yesterday? Well, except for some lady trying to get a free ride with you?” he said jokingly &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed along and then made an excuse to leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never mentioned that the person I noticed in my car was a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/""&gt;woman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"This story took place when I was seven. I lived in a large broken down farm house, it was just me my dad, and my friend, Albert his name is. My dad worked nights at  some gas station, I think it was. He didn’t make much, hence living in some abandon house, but he tried. He tried to support me. And for the most, he did. Each day when my dad came home after a shift of nights he would kiss me good night and bring me a lollipop from work, as long as I was a good boy at school that day. My dad worried about me when he left me at home but I was fine. I had Albert. Just me and him for the most part. Albert was also seven and he said he loved living in my house. It felt like his true home.

Well anyway, each night when dad went off to work I would climb into bed and get out a story. I would call for Albert to come and play and we would read stories until I felt tired. Then I would say goodnight to Albert and he would watch me fall asleep. Some nights I would wake up to Albert’s breath against my neck I would turn around to see his translucent body with the red drippy water under his eyes and dripping out his mouth and he would smile at me. This made me happy. I knew he cared about me. 

When this happened most the time we would play a game like eyes closed hide and seek. I love hide and seek. Albert always made me count, and I like counting. Most the time I struggled to find Albert so he would call out to help me find him. One night when we played hide and seek and I couldn’t find him, he called out and I followed his sound. It led to my open window on the second floor of the house. Albert was cheeky, he always did this. I always reached far out the window as stretchy as i could. One time I almost slipped but it was fine, Albert caught me and pulled me back in, I was fine.

One day when my dad was on nights I got into bed and started to read, but Albert didn’t want to play, he just stared at me. That was okay, Albert did this lots, but this time he didn’t stop doing it. I started feeling scared, but in the end I just fell to sleep. It was fine. In the morning Albert was still there, staring at me, the red water stuff dripping out his eyes, his mouth was wider open now and the red stuff was coming out his mouth and also nose now. Silly Albert, he is so funny with his games. Then I heard dads car drive home and Albert went back away under my bed. 

After the last night I didn’t want to invite Albert for a play as much anymore, so I read by myself, then I heard Albert crying, he was sad because I didn’t invite him for a play. That night, how was I so stupid, I should have left Albert, he wasn’t even real, but anyway, I let him play, tonight his voice was deeper he made me play hide and seek blindfolded even though I didn’t want to. I closed my eyes and like always he called for me to find him. My window was open and again, Albert called for me, this time when I didn’t want to go he started pushing me, I felt scared and told him to stop, but he pushed me harder, luckily dad came home and Albert went away.

That night dad was mad he pushed me onto my bed and hit me. I cried. I didn’t know why I was bad. He always got mad after working a long shift. His breath smelt funny and he kept yelling at me. It’s fine though he gave me a lollipop after. 

I decided I wanted Albert that next night. So he came with a bruised eye, broken nose which made me a bit sad and his red water in his eyes. Silly Albert with his funny face paint. We played hide and seek and hide from daddy. That made him mad again, but I got a lollipop so it was fine. 

Overtime Albert kept coming to play and when I was 9 he didn’t have his left eye anymore and his lip was coming Away, he didn’t have teeth but that was funny, I got lots of lollipops that month. 

I stopped going to school and daddy was at home less, when he came home he would always yell at me and stopped giving out lollipops, Albert started feeling sadder and I didn’t like dad as much anymore, life was hurt, Albert started appearing less and less.

One day I took a deep look into the mirror.

Early on into my shift, Andy asked me and Dave to go see him when we were done working. He seemed more serious than usual, I knew this meant that whatever he was planning on showing us was a big deal. After an uneventful closing shift, I went out back to see Dave waiting for me on a turned over milk crate.

We didn't say a word to each other, just a nod of agreement, we knew something big was about to happen and it felt wrong to continue cracking jokes. We walked up to Andy's shed and I knocked on the door. The door opened on the first knock and I saw Andy dressed for war. He wore all black and had a backpack with coiled rope on the side, a knife attached to his belt and three flashlights.

""You guys ready?"" He asked, with urgency in his voice. Dave replied with his own question.

""So what is so important you needed to show us?

""We are going into the grease trap. If I'm right we are going to need to kill a parasite."" Andy stated this with no sarcasm or his usual jovial demeanor.

""Charles?"" I asked. Andy shook his head and handed Dave and I a flashlight each and started walking towards the grease trap.

I should mention this now, every mention of the grease trap I made is a bit dishonest. Ours isn't exactly regular, it's more of a wooden box that leads into a sewer that has been blocked off for decades. Years ago the city decided it would be worthwhile to reroute the sewer systems in the city to be more efficient. Plenty of parts of this sewer where blocked off, abandoned and forgotten about. At some point, the general manager decided to train all of his employees to dump the oil into this box instead of taking it to the actual grease trap, for reasons I don't know. I'm telling you this so you understand that we were going on a sewer quest with a wizard to go kill a lovecraftian parasite. Fucking cool, right?

When Andy got to the grease trap, he pulled the lid open and started climbing the worn down ladder into the sewers below. Dave was quick to follow, but I hesitated. I had a really bad feeling about this. This is all too sudden, I thought, we are going into a hole, where people have died, intentionally looking for a monster. 

I was so lost in thought, about all the different ways the three of us could get slaughtered, that when I became aware of my surroundings, I realized I had climbed into the hole. I turned on the flashlight to see Andy leading the way around a corner with Dave right behind him. I ran to catch up to them, but dropped my flashlight when I saw what was there.

There was a man with a bag on his head tied to a chair sitting center stage at a dead end. Dave stood, equally as shocked as I was, against the wall. Andy turned to look at us and said,

""Josh, a while ago you asked for an explanation and I lied, I'm sorry. I learned well before you were born that the gods existed. They don't have anything that is remotely close to a divine plan in mind, they are just as chaotic and selfish as every living being on this planet. They aren't evil, just powerful, and the one I call Charles is very intelligent and kind. But he is hungry and I have taken it upon myself to keep it alive and well."" 

""To take over the world?"" I asked, backing away and getting ready to make a run for it. Dave cursed under his breath and dropped to the floor. Andy looked shocked.

""What? No, fuck, is that how that all came across? I'm sorry, I've been looking forward to showing you Charles for so long I must have hammed it up a bit.""  He said with a sheepish glance towards the ground. He continued, ""No, Charles is a young God that has grown to like people. Unfortunately, being amazingly powerful, a cult sprung up to try and harness his power.""

""To take over the world?"" I asked once again. Dave's look went from scared to confused as this revelation was made.

""Fuck if I know."" Andy said as he shrugged. Dave suddenly started laughing and getting back up to his feet, bloth Andy and I looked at him with confused faces as Dave wiped a tear from his eye.

""Ok, I think I get it now, but that still leaves one question unanswered. Who's the guy in the chair?"" Dave asked, when he was done laughing.

Andy's face lost the look of confusion and he made his way over to the man in the chair. He reached out and pulled the bag off his head. It was Cole. The man who stabbed me and probably murdered G. 

""This is one of the cultists for a god Charles called the Consumer, these guys have been feeding other gods to him for some unknown reason. That's why I brought you two down here. The Consumer has been making moves to get Charles and I won't allow it.  We need to know where the Consumer is so we can stop it."" Andy said this and a terrible thought occurred to me, was Andy planning on torturing Cole? I definitely have no sympathy for Cole, but I know I don't have the stomach to do something that horrible. 

Dave saw the pained look on my face and walked over to me, put a hand on my shoulder, and whispered.

""Don't worry so much. I promise we won't do anything too bad."" Then he raised his voice and said, ""I think you should head home Josh. You've worked hard today and I don't think you want to be making conversation with Cole anyway.""  Andy looked at me and nodded before adding,

""Josh do you still want to see what Charles looks like?"" I thought about it for a few seconds before nodding slowly.

Andy pulled something out from one of the nearby drainage pipes and held it in his arms like a newborn baby. It was exactly as he described, a shogoth, but that implies that the creature was horrifying. It was adorable, a bright yellow blob about the size of a basketball with eight tentacles and four innocent blue eyes. 

""Awe."" I said before realizing, ""Wait a second didn't this thing kill that guy that was looking for you not too long ago?"" I asked nervously, backing away from the adorable murderous god. Andy replied, a little too proud of himself,

""Yep, that guy was from the cult trying to feed this little guy off. I slipped a message to the cult that John knew where a young God was as a code to myself."" Dave raised an eyebrow and replied,

""That was stupid, why use such a common name for your code word? Surely the code would have still worked if it was, say, a guy named brick or axle or something like that.""

""Shit, you're right."" Andy said, clearly embarrassed. We all chuckled lightly, afterwards deciding to leave before Cole woke up.

Unfortunately, my strange night still wasn't over. When I made it home and got ready for bed, I noticed something unusual on my pillow. It looked like the journal I found in the kitchen ceiling. I picked it up and thought to myself, ""Should I read this? Or should I run as far away as I can?"" Someone had definitely broken into my house, but after searching every available hiding place I was satisfied and relieved to find no one. I'll wait for tomorrow, I thought, I'll bring it in and show Dave and Andy, we can read whatever the fuck it says after we all get some sleep.

I slept fairly well, which was unusual for me but I'm heading into work now. I brought the journal but still haven't opened it. I'll let you know what it says when I can post again. Until then, as always, I've been Josh.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry so much. I promise we won&amp;#39;t do anything too bad.&amp;quot; Then he raised his voice and said, &amp;quot;I think you should head home Josh. You&amp;#39;ve worked hard today and I don&amp;#39;t think you want to be making conversation with Cole anyway.&amp;quot;  Andy looked at me and nodded before adding,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Josh do you still want to see what Charles looks like?&amp;quot; I thought about it for a few seconds before nodding slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy pulled something out from one of the nearby drainage pipes and held it in his arms like a newborn baby. It was exactly as he described, a shogoth, but that implies that the creature was horrifying. It was adorable, a bright yellow blob about the size of a basketball with eight tentacles and four innocent blue eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Awe.&amp;quot; I said before realizing, &amp;quot;Wait a second didn&amp;#39;t this thing kill that guy that was looking for you not too long ago?&amp;quot; I asked nervously, backing away from the adorable murderous god. Andy replied, a little too proud of himself,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yep, that guy was from the cult trying to feed this little guy off. I slipped a message to the cult that John knew where a young God was as a code to myself.&amp;quot; Dave raised an eyebrow and replied,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was stupid, why use such a common name for your code word? Surely the code would have still worked if it was, say, a guy named brick or axle or something like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shit, you&amp;#39;re right.&amp;quot; Andy said, clearly embarrassed. We all chuckled lightly, afterwards deciding to leave before Cole woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my strange night still wasn&amp;#39;t over. When I made it home and got ready for bed, I noticed something unusual on my pillow. It looked like the journal I found in the kitchen ceiling. I picked it up and thought to myself, &amp;quot;Should I read this? Or should I run as far away as I can?&amp;quot; Someone had definitely broken into my house, but after searching every available hiding place I was satisfied and relieved to find no one. I&amp;#39;ll wait for tomorrow, I thought, I&amp;#39;ll bring it in and show Dave and Andy, we can read whatever the fuck it says after we all get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept fairly well, which was unusual for me but I&amp;#39;m heading into work now. I brought the journal but still haven&amp;#39;t opened it. I&amp;#39;ll let you know what it says when I can post again. Until then, as always, I&amp;#39;ve been Josh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 7 coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"The biggest crime that I did was that I had not shared this earlier and kept it as a dark secret

When I was 14 years old, I got an ethernet connection at my apartment PC for the very first time (overprotective parents). My father worked abroad as a project manager and my mother was a housewife back then.

My father was pretty skeptical about the internet connection thingy, saying that it was unnecessary and would ""distract me"" from my studies , but my stubbornness helped me to get one. Around that time, cybercrimes were pretty common (phishing, cyberbullying, and other stuff like Pornography, etc.) , so my mother used to sit in front of me while I was using internet. 

Time passed by, my mother became tired of sitting in front of me everytime, so she just waived it off, and I started to post horror stories online via a VPN at a website called Grindgore.net. I started to write stories about intensely disturbing stuff under the pen name: Sorcerer 

One particular story that I wrote (which got the most likes and views) was about human trafficking and fetish pornography-  A man abducts his daughter's friend and livestreams her torture in an anonymous website (ever heard about red rooms?) and ends up cutting her breasts, and his clitoris and eating it, saying that -he wants her 'gifted parts' to be with him forever. Yeah it's kinda creepy but I still wrote it.

For my next story, which was highly anticipated in that small community I made, I decided to go for some occult imagery. The one thing that people complimented about my storytelling was that it was too realistic, so I thrived for authenticity in my stories. After asking one of my friends for help, he recommended me to search in the deep web. So I did, with proper precautions. 

It was Tuesday, 5 pm. My mom was out for her daily Yoga session, so I was alone. The doorbell rang . My father was back to the house after 6 months of abroad work. He hugged me tightly, but there was something weird about that hug. I smelled something , as if it were rotting. Weird enough, but I brushed it off as the smell of sweat. He handed me two luggage,and said that there is some more work , and he'd come around 8pm, and he left. I got back to my research. I wasn't feeling like doing work today, so I procrastinated and decided to look for some offbeat stuff in the deep web.

Apparently I didn't know the notorious reputation of deep web(or dark web in this case) at that time. 

I entered into a forum where people discuss about their weird and unsettling fetishes. Some have even posted drawings, enough to sending chills down my spine, but I just soaked it all in. Until, this happened.

A random user in the forum posted a countdown under the ""GoryTish"" section .

Out of curiosity, I opened the tab and saw a photo of a girl- 15 years old- plaited hair, chappy lips, emerald eyes. Something was off the grid, eerie, bugging the hell out of me.

I decided to look through my saved drafts of all the stories that I had written. Horrifyingly enough, the description of the girl in my hit story- Wasted Emerald. I can't shrug off the fact that the title of the story also resembles that of the event.
I get a call from my mom, saying that she will be late because of some issues with her car. I cut the call and sigh.

I knew for what I was in for. 

I looked around. No one in the room. The room was dimly lit. Perfect mood setting. I fill out a small form to witness the thing. I knew that this was something I could not unsee, something that I would not be able to forgive myself for.

The stream starts. I'm already warning you, this is very gross and is damning to even share it, let alone witness it. On my screen was a Twitch-like setup: The big screen, a comment box at the left and a small typing box at the bottom. The first thing I see is a camera on roof capturing the girl strapped to a pool table, screaming(trying to). She was naked, and was gagged. A computer was besides her. After about 12 minutes, a man(43?) enters the frame, with a trolley containing surgical instruments. Something made me feel as if it was inspired by my story. Who knows, I continued watching it. 

He starts by expressing his love for the girl(fucking sicko) and how he loves her, before violently whipping her and then proceeds to strangle her, and so she passes out. What happens next was something I never saw coming.

He looks up to the camera (the video quality was shitty) and wears a green surgical mask , and then he waves to the right at the camera. I looked at the right of my screen and saw hundreds of comments flooding in. The comments were very disgusting- some saying to stab her on the belly and then rape her, some requesting for an anal, and other atrocious acts. One crazy dipshit even requested him to cut her tits off. The guy in the video then shows the camera a thumbs up and then picks up a butcher's knife, and then went up to the girl, placing the knife near her breasts.

This was FUCKING TOO MUCH.

I closed the website and deleted the browser. I even gave a thought to format my PC, but that would be too much. I immediately got my PC scanned and deleted all my history and deleted all of my stories from that website.

My father came back to our apartment at around 9 PM. I tightly hugged him. He whispers in my ears that there is something for me in the bag. I open the bag and find a brand new phone.

,nosleep,"*The following is a transcript from a short radio broadcast that has been picked up by various listenersacross the continental United States. Many have been perplexed by its sudden appearance and how it seems to preempt whatever song or radio program they are listening to at the time. It has even been known to appear on streaming programs such as podcasts or Spotify. Listeners have described hearing different episodes and there have been many different situations and incidents.*

*Michael contacted me from a hotel at an undisclosed location. I wondered if he was still on his journey and was recovering from the fallout of whatever broadcast he had listened to. He seemed distraught while telling me his tale and I feared the worst. I let him take his time. This is his story.*

It was summer.

Our summer.

A summer that felt like it had been made for Julia and I.

The season, the tilt of the Earth towards the sun at that particular moment in time, it felt like it had been arranged just for us.

Oh sure summer was happening for everyone else at the same point in time, but they were just along for the ride, planning their vacations and holidays around *our* summer, our schedule, our time. 

The Pacific Coast Highway, finished right on schedule in the 60s because they knew that on this date in 2019, Michael and Julia, two young lovers that were very much in love, would be tracing it north on the adventure of a lifetime.

It had been a dream of ours to drive along the entire western border of the United States, right along the coast. We had flown into San Diego, rented a car and started north. We stopped at sight seeing places all along the way, different amazing restaurants, motels and hotels and bed and breakfasts. One night we even slept right there on the beach in a secluded little spot, the stars overhead and the crashing of waves at our feet, Julia’s heart beating into my hand as she curled into the crook of my body and me counting every breath she took. I almost proposed to her right then and there.

I had designs on that, though. My plan was to propose on Cannon Beach in Oregon. Right there on the edge of the world, the sea stretching out before us like eternity, the only unit of time that could measure my love for Julia. If things went well and she said yes, then we would make our way up to Seattle, a city that she had always wanted to visit.

Looking back, it was the best summer of my life, the last time I was truly happy for an extended period of time. Even after we had heard that goddamned broadcast and motherfucking Buck Hensley, the rest of the trip was still magical and something that I returned to as a place of comfort when my life became unraveled.

After a busy day of seeing the Golden Gate Bridge and the redwood forest at Muir Woods National monument, we headed towards Mendocino, California where we had reservations at a seaside bed and breakfast. We hadn’t accounted for the slower speeds we would be driving on the winding coastal roads and night had fallen. I was nodding off in the passenger seat. We had about an hour to go.

“This music is putting me to sleep. How can you drive and listen to it?” I said. Julia was listening to some lo-fi hip hop thing called Beats to Relax/Study To.

“I like it. Helps me focus,” she said. “Just relax there, big guy. I’ve got this. If it’s putting you to sleep, take yourself a little nap.”

I started to lean back in the chair when I heard someone whispering over the car speakers.

“Do you hear that? Is that part of the song?” I asked.

“Yes. It’s weird,” she said and turned up the volume.

“...see them right now…” we heard a hushed voice say.

“I’m gonna turn this off,” Julia said cautiously. As she reached for the dial, there was a chorus of whispers all talking at once and over each other. I couldn’t make out any words. She quickly turned off the radio and soon all we could hear were the tires on the road.

“Creepy,” I said. “Well, I’m awake now.”

Just then the radio turned on on its own and there was static. We tried pressing buttons, and turning it off, but it was like there was a glitch and the stereo didn’t respond. Julia and I exchanged confused and concerned looks. The rest of the car seemed to be driving and performing ok. Some tinny music cut through the static and a voice began talking as clear as day, a radio DJ of sorts. This is what he said.

&gt;Bonjour folks, Buck Hensley joining you this evening for yet another edition of “The Rules of the Road”. Do you know what the French call an orgasm? That’s right, they call it “la petite mort” which translates roughly to  “the little death” in English. I wonder why they call it that? Is it because you get dead tired after? Is it because a bunch of your little sperm are sent to an early death, never to achieve their ultimate goal? Or is it because a piece of you dies afterwards and this brilliant moment won’t last and had nothing to do but end so soon after it began? Our whole lives are filled with little deaths such as these, little moments of pleasure that only pass by, each one counting down to the big one at the end. Better rack ‘em up while you can.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for me, if I was in charge of naming it, I’d come up with a much different term and a whole lot less morbid. What’s the French expression for “that was great, let’s go have a sandwich”?

Now, Julia and I exchanged amused glances and we both chuckled. What was all of this?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sorry to get so tawdry with you folks out there, but it is relevant to tonight’s rule. Are you ready? If at any point in your journey you come across a bumper sticker that says, “HONK IF YOU’RE HORNY, then you must...well you must honk my friends. There ain’t nothing to it! How simple is that? The only thing is that the car’s driver *might* creep you out a bit. Don’t worry. She’s harmless.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I know what you’re gonna say. You’re gonna say, “Buck I ain’t even horny. Why if I were to honk at that vehicle with a HONK IF YOU’RE HORNY bumper sticker on it, why that would be a bald faced lie. Besides, I can’t go around honking at cars. What do I look like? Some sort of horny goose? My auntie used to have a pet goose and it was the meanest damn honkingest thing you ever saw. Used to chase after us all over the yard and flog us and bite us. I will not honk!”  
&gt;  
&gt;And to that I say, “fair enough”. You don’t wanna honk, then don’t honk. I have my doubts to the claim that you’re not actually horny. In fact, I’d say you might be a bit suppressed. And buddy, people that suppress their sexuality are some of the horniest billy goats around. Just ask one of them people in the clergy. Or them high and mighty preachers telling you how bad sex is and get caught in the motels with their pants down with an underaged sex trafficking victim.  
&gt;  
&gt;You ever been caught punching your spunker in a closet? No? Pretty good hiding place isn't it? But I digress...this is what will happen if you deny that you’re horny.  
&gt;  
&gt;Have you ever had a case of blue balls? And no I don’t mean like that time you got a little too tipsy at Steve Finklestein’s bachelor party and passed out and somebody got a little overzealous with the blue sharpies, *thanks* Brad. I’m talking about the condition known as blue balls, which is slang for an ache in your gut as a result of a deep primal urge denied. The cure of course is a release and if someone is denying you that release or if it the object of your desire is unattainable, then you have to do so by your own hand. But you may come to find that there is no real release to be found here, so by all means I beg you to “honk if you’re horny” to avoid this predicament.  
&gt;  
&gt;Welp, that’s all for tonight. It is that time where I must echo my French brethren and bid you all a hearty “adios”. Ya’ll be good out there. Stay safe. Stay lively. Stay randy. Stay lonely. Me llamo Buck Hensley and these are “The Rules of the Road”.

The display lights of the radio went dark and the audio ceased.

“What in the fuck?” I asked.

“Beats me. Was kind of funny. You think it was some sort of glitch? Or hey, I’ve heard about people hacking your phone from afar and playing little tricks like that. Can you check my phone? Also, see how much further the b-and-b is.”

I checked Julia’s phone and could see no evidence of any trickery. The maps app was still active and the Spotify app still had the hip hop mix pulled up, although it was on pause.

“I don’t see anything.”

“Hey,” Julia said in a serious tone and then looked over at me with a devilish grin. She hit the middle of the steering wheel with the bottom of her palm, twice. The car honked and we both cracked up laughing and when we got to the bed and breakfast we both made good on this declaration.

The journey continued without incident and at Cannon Beach I was ready to propose. With the ring in my pocket, we walked up and down the beach and my heart was racing and I was nervous and trying to find the right moment. The sun dipped towards the horizon and the waves were growing stronger and crashing and we stood out there, just staring at them, holding hands, and as she was distracted by the view I got down on my knee and presented her with the ring and she said yes. We kissed hard and long right there and made out like two teenagers there, lying in the sand and I didn’t know if anyone was around to watch us and judge our public display of affection, but I didn’t care. It felt like we were the only ones.

The next few days we were brimming with happiness, a walking dream as we tooled leisurely around Seattle sightseeing, mornings sleeping in, that famous coffee helping to cut through the overcast days. Julia was radiant in that post-engagement glow. I caught her constantly looking at her engagement ring, trying to do so in a discreet manner and I found this cute.

“Aren’t you gonna post the big news on Instagram?” I asked.

“Believe me, I want to shout it from the digital rooftops and tell complete strangers. But right now is just for me and you. I’ll make a big post when we get back,” she said.

I liked that about her.

The dream came to an end and we were on I-5, heading to Seat-Tac International where we would fly home to Chicago when we saw it, a faded and graying box van with a yellow bumper sticker on it’s back door that read: HONK, IF YOU’RE HORNY.

“Oh my God! Look!” Julia exclaimed with a laugh. “You better honk!”

I laid onto the horn, let it blare for a good few seconds, and then followed it up with a couple staccato beeps for good measure. We overtook the van in the passing lane and I looked over at the driver.

Why is it that every time you pass someone and you decide to take a look at the driver, they look over at you at the exact same moment that you do? I really wish this wasn’t the case, especially in this instance as the image instantly seared into my brain and I can still see her sometimes when I close my eyes. She wore a nun’s habit and her eyes were bloodshot and bulging. This was further accentuated by the makeup she wore as her eyes were rimmed in black eyeliner and her eyelids were heavy with fuchsia eyeshadow. Below her nose, there was nothing but the pink ridges of her gums with her yellowed teeth jutting from them; the entirety of her lips was just gone, just an oval of slick wet gingiva and teeth where her mouth should be. Her facial muscles pulled the oval wider as she smiled and drool slid down her chin. She wore no shirt and her chest was bare save for a thick beaded necklace with a crucifix dangling from it and pasties with long tassels on her breasts.

I gunned the gas pedal in terror and left the van far behind as I heard Julia make a gasping croak in her throat. We didn’t say anything for a long time after.

Later, I offered up a rational explanation. “Maybe it was a performance piece? Some sort of statement on religion or the Catholic church? They have all sorts of weird art shit out here. Was there supposed to be some sort of parade today?”

We came up with theories the whole way back, but we stopped discussing the bizarre episode once we got back to Chicago. We both agreed that it had to have been some sort of performance piece, a makeup artist strutting their stuff and driving about town. The excitement of the engagement and telling our friends and family soon took over the strange incident of our trip and the nun and her lipless grin became a shared nightmare that we both believed would go away if we quit talking about it.

The thing about nightmares though, is that they have a way of recurring.",t2_4leylht9,False,,0,False,Honk If You're Horny,[],r/nosleep,False,6,flair-series,0,False,t3_fglt67,False,dark,,public,327,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Series,False,327,,True,,1583950273.0,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583905873.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is a transcript from a short radio broadcast that has been picked up by various listenersacross the continental United States. Many have been perplexed by its sudden appearance and how it seems to preempt whatever song or radio program they are listening to at the time. It has even been known to appear on streaming programs such as podcasts or Spotify. Listeners have described hearing different episodes and there have been many different situations and incidents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael contacted me from a hotel at an undisclosed location. I wondered if he was still on his journey and was recovering from the fallout of whatever broadcast he had listened to. He seemed distraught while telling me his tale and I feared the worst. I let him take his time. This is his story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summer that felt like it had been made for Julia and I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season, the tilt of the Earth towards the sun at that particular moment in time, it felt like it had been arranged just for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh sure summer was happening for everyone else at the same point in time, but they were just along for the ride, planning their vacations and holidays around &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; summer, our schedule, our time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Coast Highway, finished right on schedule in the 60s because they knew that on this date in 2019, Michael and Julia, two young lovers that were very much in love, would be tracing it north on the adventure of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a dream of ours to drive along the entire western border of the United States, right along the coast. We had flown into San Diego, rented a car and started north. We stopped at sight seeing places all along the way, different amazing restaurants, motels and hotels and bed and breakfasts. One night we even slept right there on the beach in a secluded little spot, the stars overhead and the crashing of waves at our feet, Julia’s heart beating into my hand as she curled into the crook of my body and me counting every breath she took. I almost proposed to her right then and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had designs on that, though. My plan was to propose on Cannon Beach in Oregon. Right there on the edge of the world, the sea stretching out before us like eternity, the only unit of time that could measure my love for Julia. If things went well and she said yes, then we would make our way up to Seattle, a city that she had always wanted to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it was the best summer of my life, the last time I was truly happy for an extended period of time. Even after we had heard that goddamned broadcast and motherfucking Buck Hensley, the rest of the trip was still magical and something that I returned to as a place of comfort when my life became unraveled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a busy day of seeing the Golden Gate Bridge and the redwood forest at Muir Woods National monument, we headed towards Mendocino, California where we had reservations at a seaside bed and breakfast. We hadn’t accounted for the slower speeds we would be driving on the winding coastal roads and night had fallen. I was nodding off in the passenger seat. We had about an hour to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This music is putting me to sleep. How can you drive and listen to it?” I said. Julia was listening to some lo-fi hip hop thing called Beats to Relax/Study To.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like it. Helps me focus,” she said. “Just relax there, big guy. I’ve got this. If it’s putting you to sleep, take yourself a little nap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to lean back in the chair when I heard someone whispering over the car speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you hear that? Is that part of the song?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. It’s weird,” she said and turned up the volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“...see them right now…” we heard a hushed voice say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m gonna turn this off,” Julia said cautiously. As she reached for the dial, there was a chorus of whispers all talking at once and over each other. I couldn’t make out any words. She quickly turned off the radio and soon all we could hear were the tires on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Creepy,” I said. “Well, I’m awake now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then the radio turned on on its own and there was static. We tried pressing buttons, and turning it off, but it was like there was a glitch and the stereo didn’t respond. Julia and I exchanged confused and concerned looks. The rest of the car seemed to be driving and performing ok. Some tinny music cut through the static and a voice began talking as clear as day, a radio DJ of sorts. This is what he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonjour folks, Buck Hensley joining you this evening for yet another edition of “The Rules of the Road”. Do you know what the French call an orgasm? That’s right, they call it “la petite mort” which translates roughly to  “the little death” in English. I wonder why they call it that? Is it because you get dead tired after? Is it because a bunch of your little sperm are sent to an early death, never to achieve their ultimate goal? Or is it because a piece of you dies afterwards and this brilliant moment won’t last and had nothing to do but end so soon after it began? Our whole lives are filled with little deaths such as these, little moments of pleasure that only pass by, each one counting down to the big one at the end. Better rack ‘em up while you can.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, if I was in charge of naming it, I’d come up with a much different term and a whole lot less morbid. What’s the French expression for “that was great, let’s go have a sandwich”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Julia and I exchanged amused glances and we both chuckled. What was all of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to get so tawdry with you folks out there, but it is relevant to tonight’s rule. Are you ready? If at any point in your journey you come across a bumper sticker that says, “HONK IF YOU’RE HORNY, then you must...well you must honk my friends. There ain’t nothing to it! How simple is that? The only thing is that the car’s driver &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; creep you out a bit. Don’t worry. She’s harmless.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know what you’re gonna say. You’re gonna say, “Buck I ain’t even horny. Why if I were to honk at that vehicle with a HONK IF YOU’RE HORNY bumper sticker on it, why that would be a bald faced lie. Besides, I can’t go around honking at cars. What do I look like? Some sort of horny goose? My auntie used to have a pet goose and it was the meanest damn honkingest thing you ever saw. Used to chase after us all over the yard and flog us and bite us. I will not honk!”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to that I say, “fair enough”. You don’t wanna honk, then don’t honk. I have my doubts to the claim that you’re not actually horny. In fact, I’d say you might be a bit suppressed. And buddy, people that suppress their sexuality are some of the horniest billy goats around. Just ask one of them people in the clergy.

&lt;p&gt;You ever been caught punching your spunker in a closet? No? Pretty good hiding place isn&amp;#39;t it? But I digress...this is what will happen if you deny that you’re horny.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a case of blue balls? And no I don’t mean like that time you got a little too tipsy at Steve Finklestein’s bachelor party and passed out and somebody got a little overzealous with the blue sharpies, &lt;em&gt;thanks&lt;/em&gt; Brad.

,nosleep,"This was a story told to me by my friend Lucia.

Two years ago, when I was 16, me and my friend Angeline were bored.
It was 11pm on a Saturday night, my parents nor sister were at home and there was nothing to do, nothing ""interesting"" at least.
Me and Angeline have always loved thrills and horror and just anything scary, creepy and terrifying.
So she decided that we should look up a game to play.
A paranormal game.
There were the ""usuals"" she said like the Elevator game or One-Man Hide and Seek which she both had played. She had played basically all the games is what she always liked to say. 
But there was one game she didn't know about called
""The Game of Doors"".
I hadn't heard of it either.
So the rules were as following:

-You need to be in a house
-There is no electric light lit and no door open
-You need to be in a room which connects to 6 other rooms
-You need a second person
-You need 5 mirrors
-The second person and 5 mirrors are placed behind the doors 
- You can't have a cell phone on you

- You start the game as soon as you place yourself in the middle of the room after the upper conditions, blind yourself and repeat:
""The Door I open will lead my path"" six times
- Go to any door and feel the knob
- If the knob has something strange to it, like heat or cold or some weird element then enter the room
-If you hear a voice saying open your eyes or remove your blindfold leave immediately 
-If you entered a strange knob room and don't hear a voice, make the environment visible to you
-If done correctly you will be granted a massive treasure
-After receiving the treasure, take it and close your eyes
-Exit the room, close the door and repeat the phrase 
""The Door lead me to my path, I shall now return"" twice 
-Open your eyes and open the door to the room your partner went into

Angeline thought it was a wonderful game to play, especially since she was broke and needed some form of payment. 
I carefully read through the rules for the second person:

-Do not tell your partner these rules
-Start the game like your partner will tell you to
-After closing the door close your eyes
-If the door opens say either ""Open your eyes"" or ""Remove your blindfold"" 
-If the door closes you were successful, if not repeatedly ask the phrase while getting more and more aggressive 
-When the door is closed open your eyes
-Now, scream in unbearable pain and don't stop until you have to breathe
-Wait
-When your friend opens the door you have successfully played the game

It was weird, sure but we didn't care. 
Nobody was at home and we live in a rural area. 
A perfect spot for something like this. 
Or so I thought. 

Angeline and I now began preparing after going into to the hallway crossing in my house. 
All the lights were now off and the mirrors were placed. 
I went into the room and Angeline in the middle of the crossing. 
She then said a phrase about six times. 
Then I heard her open a door. 
Then she closed it. 
Then my door went open. 
I said: ""Open your eyes"" 
And the door closed. 
Then she opened another door. 
And another. And another. And another. And another,
Which was impossible since we had six doors in the room. 
Now she opened the eighth door and closed it. 
And the ninth. And the tenth. 
I was getting second thoughts on this game. 
11th,12th, 13th,14th,15th, 16th... 
How were there so many doors? 
... 20th,21st,22nd,23rd,24th,25th...
Ths sound of opening doors grew fainter and fainter which meant that she had gone a long distance. 
The room would not have been bigger than my bedroom though, so how did it grow so quiet? 

Then my door re-opened. 
""Open your eyes""
""What are you doing?"" 
I repeated myself. 
The voice, confused replied: 
""My eyes are already open. Yours aren't.""
Then I recognized the voice. 
It was my sister. 

I opened my eyes. 
There she was. My sister. And Angeline nowhere to be found. 
I asked about Angeline. She told me she was about to ask me that. 
""Wait, so you didn't see her?"" 
""No. I got home and saw all the lights out and turned them back on. ""

Wasn't that against the game's rules? 

""And then you did what?"" 
""I looked at my phone to the time saying 11:45 PM.""

15 minutes after we prepared. 

""Uh huh. And what did you do after  that?""
""I came to look for you Two and now I'm here.""

We searched the entire house but nothing. 
Not a single trace of Angeline. 
As if she was transported away from this world. 
We went to the police and reported her missing. 
Her mom was devastated, obviously. 
Her Dad not so much, he didn't really care about her anyway. 
That was two years ago.

&lt;p&gt;It was weird, sure but we didn&amp;#39;t care. 
Nobody was at home and we live in a rural area. 
A perfect spot for something like this. 
Or so I thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angeline and I now began preparing after going into to the hallway crossing in my house. 
All the lights were now off and the mirrors were placed. 
I went into the room and Angeline in the middle of the crossing. 
She then said a phrase about six times. 
Then I heard her open a door. 
Then she closed it. 
Then my door went open. 
I said: &amp;quot;Open your eyes&amp;quot; 
And the door closed. 
Then she opened another door. 
And another. And another. And another. And another,
Which was impossible since we had six doors in the room. 
Now she opened the eighth door and closed it. 
And the ninth. And the tenth. 
I was getting second thoughts on this game. 
11th,12th, 13th,14th,15th, 16th... 
How were there so many doors? 
... 20th,21st,22nd,23rd,24th,25th...
Ths sound of opening doors grew fainter and fainter which meant that she had gone a long distance. 
The room would not have been bigger than my bedroom though, so how did it grow so quiet? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my door re-opened. 
&amp;quot;Open your eyes&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; 
I repeated myself. 
The voice, confused replied: 
&amp;quot;My eyes are already open. Yours aren&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;
Then I recognized the voice. 
It was my sister. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes. 
There she was. My sister. And Angeline nowhere to be found. 
I asked about Angeline. She told me she was about to ask me that. 
&amp;quot;Wait, so you didn&amp;#39;t see her?&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;No. I got home and saw all the lights out and turned them back on. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t that against the game&amp;#39;s rules? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And then you did what?&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;I looked at my phone to the time saying 11:45 PM.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 minutes after we prepared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh huh. And what did you do after  that?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I came to look for you Two and now I&amp;#39;m here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We searched the entire house but nothing. 
Not a single trace of Angeline. 
As if she was transported away from this world. 
We went to the police and reported her missing. 
Her mom was devastated, obviously. 
Her Dad not so much, he didn&amp;#39;t really care about her anyway. 
That was two years ago. 
She still hasn&amp;#39;t been found yet. I hope she&amp;#39;s doing OK.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"Looking at my face in the mirror, I cringed. It was awful, there was so much bruising. My ex husband had agreed to keep the kids for a week, at least until I wouldn’t scare them. I missed them terribly and the phone calls at night seemed to pierce my chest and left me depressed. 

As it turns out, once they realized it was the app that lured Kathy and I out they found more cases in neighboring cities. 4 women in total so far including Elliana. The creators of the app were under intense scrutiny but it was starting to look like they had been hacked. I don’t know many of the details, some of it I picked up through news websites and some through questioning. They weren’t exactly sure how I fit into this since I didn’t have the app before that night and I think if I hadn’t been attacked I might be a suspect after finding a body linked to the case. 

My job was incredibly understanding and I worked from home that week. The first few days were nice, I appreciated the silence. I worked out of bed and took frequent naps. By Wednesday though I was getting antsy. The bruises were fading and the swelling was going down. I went out for coffee at Starbucks, just the drive thru, I didn’t want to have people staring at me. I was avoiding talking to anyone about it. I felt like I was going crazy, I couldn’t focus. I finally went and bought some pot from a mom friend I knew from a group years back. I drove home feeling guilty and paranoid. 

I hadn’t smoked pot for years. Years and years. I fumbled with the joint and sat below my bedroom window so they couldn’t see me from the street. I inhaled and held waiting for the loopy feeling. Soon I was leaning against the wall behind me and I was taken by an intense flashback of Kathy smoking in my car. I started shaking and the world around me felt like it was sharper and in focus. I couldn't breathe suddenly and I shut my eyes tight and tried to bring myself down which was hard. I found my phone and called my dad. 

Maybe it was because I was seeking parental comfort or because being high made me feel like I was young again. I got this feeling that if I walked out of my room I would be back in my house I grew up in with my mom in a baggy shirt and mom shorts, putting away linens and staring me down as if trying to decide whether I was high or if it was even worth the fight. That was all we did in high school,  fight. 

""Hello sweetie, how ya doin?"" Dad asked concerned. He had visited in the hospital and held my mom while she cried and stroked my hair. 
""Daddy, I'm freaking out. I'm high, and I thought it would help but now I can't- can't breathe."" I started gasping. The world tilted. 
""What do you smell?"" He asked, I heard his keys jingling and his voice straining to remain even. ""Come on now.""
""I don't know. I-I guess grass from outside."" I struggled to hold onto the thought and now I was wondering if it was grass at all. 
""Ok, what do you feel? Touch something, what do you feel?"" I heard a door shut and his car door opening. He was coming. 
""The carpet, its rough. I miss my old house with its soft carpet."" I laid on the floor and pressed my cheek against it. Some part of my knew it hurt to do that but I didn't feel like moving.  
""Great baby, that's good. What can you hear?"" His voice echoed a little and I knew he had put me on speakerphone through his car stereo.  

I listened and I mostly heard blood rushing in my ears. So I said so. He told me a story about me at 4 and determined to climb some rock all the big kids could climb. It was long and I drifted through it until I heard him knocking at my door. I stood up off the floor feeling a little more sober and walked awkwardly down the stairs and to the door to let him in. 

He set me on the couch and went to the kitchen. I stared at the window watching the sun hit the curtains. I think at one point I was dozing but had no real sense of time. I began to wonder if my dad was really here.  Of course he was, I could hear him in the kitchen moving around. Someone was in the kitchen moving around. 

Him coming out of the kitchen surprised me. I felt awkward and wondered if my face looked high. He was holding a plate and a cup with steam coming up. I watched the steam drift upwards. 

""Here sweetie. Tea with lemon in it, the lemon will you bring you down a bit.  I made you a potato in the microwave. You don't have much to eat here. I'll take you to dinner when you're a little less… frazzled."" Dad handed me the cup first and sat next to me holding the plate in his lap. 

""I thought it would make me feel better."" I said softly, sipping the tea trying not to slurp and ended up spilling it down my face and on my shirt. ""It's been so long since I've done this. I don't remember getting like this though.""

""I know. What's going on?  Have you called anyone to talk to about the attack?""
I shook my head.

""You should. What were you doing out there anyway?"" He sounded so sad I thought. I replayed his question im my head over and over before realizing I needed to respond. 

""That Elliana girl. I found her.  Theo led me to her. He said she came to him at night and told him where to look for her. I can't stop thinking about her."" 

""The art teacher at his daycare? "" my dad asked confused. 

""What?""

""I saw her picture on the news, that's her. She came a few times I think to his daycare. She helped them paint."" 

""How do you know that and I don't?"" I started realizing that I was coming down some. 

""I dropped him off there when you were working early for those few weeks. The teacher for his room was showing me. They were excited to work with the college on special things for preschoolers. I think they said she did 3 sessions with Elliana Springs. I only remember really because I thought the name was weird."" 

""Oh god, so he did know her. That still doesn't explain how he knew where to find her though. I don't understand. I keep seeing things now, in the house and im scared."" I leaned against his arm. 

""Did I ever tell you about the house we lived in before my parents moved us to the house they lived in before they died?"" I shook my head wondering where he was going with this. ""Well, I was young. It was haunted though. I have this clear memory of a dog chasing me down the stairs, I can still feel the terror I felt racing down to the bottom before it disappeared. We use to hear people walking around. I saw black shapes of people wandering throughout the house. My sister and I stayed right next to my mom in that house. It was oppressive, in fact by the time we had bought the next house we all slept in the same bed. I told  my grandma about it once and she grabbed my shoulders with those bony hands she had, used to hurt so bad, she looked me straight in my eyes and said I had to ignore it or they would follow me.""

He stopped talking and traded my cup for the plate.  The potato was cooled. 

""Your mom never believed that stuff but like I said, I could put aside everything except that dog chasing me.  I've seen shadow people my whole life. Your great aunt is supposedly psychic. You should call her to come over.  Even if you don't believe it maybe just having someone listen and tell you they fixed it will help."" My dad put his arm around me and I dozed off while he did crosswords on his phone. He did take me to dinner,  I got stared at but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. 


That night,  I slept fitfully,  waking up often and unsure of why,  I felt the blankets tug next to me and reached for Theo, who wasn't there. I opened my eyes gasping and scanning the floor. Nothing. Of course nothing.  I thought I heard whispering in the hallway and my heart stopped. The house was dark and suddenly extra quiet. I lay as still as I could, completely frozen until I began to fall back asleep. I felt someone watching me and my eyes popped open, a face in front of me. Close, so close. I screamed and scrambled backwards and the face was gone. Too quickly to make out who it was or whether it had been there at all. I noticed a light in the hall and without thinking I got up and went towards it. Theo's door was open and his night light circulated through a rainbow of colors. 

I knew I hadn't turned it on and that I had most definitely left his door shut.  I went in and shut it off, I turned to look at his bed, maybe expecting to see his small face, mouth slack and drooling ever so slightly. Baby fists bunched up over his head. It was empty as it should be, with them still at their dad's. For a moment I forgot about the terror that had brought me in here and clutched my hands over my heart as if I could put pressure on the ache of missing them. 

I turned to the chair I held him in and collapsed in it, folding myself in half, hand pressed to my mouth while I cried for the week of missing them. After settling I sat straight up, took a deep cleansing breath and straightened my shoulders to head to bed. There in the doorway, not a shadow at all stood Elliana Springs watching me. Her face beaten. My breath stopped completely then. She disappeared as if she had never been there. 

I got up and went to the door looking around, feeling insanity teasing around the edges of my brain. I saw a shadow of a person go into my room, lingering in the doorway as if it knew I saw it. I was mentally exhausted and I turned and went to the bathroom. I locked the door and turned on the water in the sink and laid in the bathtub. I shook from fear or cold, I don't know, then I fell back asleep in the dark where I couldn't make out shapes of people anymore. 

The next day I did call my great aunt,  I told her the entire situation. All of it. I realized halfway through it was unnecessary and my dad was right, I needed to call my therapist and set up an appointment.  My great aunt May listened and then insisted on coming over. I sat on the front porch and waited for her. A good 2 hours of sitting but, there was no desire to go in the house alone.

She arrived in a car driven by someone. She was chatting with them as she got out of the car, gesturing and laughing with the driver.  As soon as the driver drove off she carefully walked up to me, holding a bag in her frail looking hands. 

""Aunt May, thank you for coming."" I said leaning down to hug her. 

""I got an Uber! At my age, I use an app on my phone!"" She sounded proud and delighted, telling me all about the kid at church who helped her with apps on her phone. Every time she said apps she said it carefully like it was a new word, tricking her tongue with itself and she was afraid the wrong word would come out.

""That's wonderful, would you like to sit on the sofa?"" 

""No. I think I can just get started. These white candles, light them and put them in every room."" Aunt May dug out candles, handing them to me without looking. I did as I was told while she walked around upstairs.  When she came down she looked tired. 

""Well I've walked through. I put symbols above your doors, don't worry about them but don't remove any of them. I've met your kids before. I thought it then. Theo is gifted, though it doesn't feel like a gift I'm sure, but he is. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that he was connected to the girl since he knew her before. She died and she came looking for him. I've sent her away. There seems to be a portal in Elizabeth's room. I'm not sure what opened it or how it got there. These things happen, but I did my best to close that. Keep the candles and place one in your bedroom's. That should take care of it. You'll probably always have something happen here and there. If Theo doesn't outgrow it, it'll get worse around puberty. It always does. Hormones seem to attract attention, the wild energy and the scattered thoughts.  If it gets bad again, I'll send you a book to read that tells you how to cleanse.""

I thanked her repeatedly, I walked through the bedrooms thinking they would feel different but they didn't really feel any certain way. The next few weeks there were no more discussions about night time visitors and we settled back into our routine. I can't comment much on the attack because of the ongoing investigation. The attacker still hasn't been caught but from what I have heard it sounds like he fled the area. There's no trace and no more women missing. The game has been deleted.

There seems to be a portal in Elizabeth&amp;#39;s room. I&amp;#39;m not sure what opened it or how it got there. These things happen, but I did my best to close that. Keep the candles and place one in your bedroom&amp;#39;s. That should take care of it. You&amp;#39;ll probably always have something happen here and there. If Theo doesn&amp;#39;t outgrow it, it&amp;#39;ll get worse around puberty. It always does. Hormones seem to attract attention, the wild energy and the scattered thoughts.  If it gets bad again, I&amp;#39;ll send you a book to read that tells you how to cleanse.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thanked her repeatedly, I walked through the bedrooms thinking they would feel different but they didn&amp;#39;t really feel any certain way. The next few weeks there were no more discussions about night time visitors and we settled back into our routine. I can&amp;#39;t comment much on the attack because of the ongoing investigation. The attacker still hasn&amp;#39;t been caught but from what I have heard it sounds like he fled the area. There&amp;#39;s no trace and no more women missing. The game has been deleted.  &lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I will never forget it. 

It was a bright, sunny, summer day. One where you had to squint hard to see anything above the brim of your own cap, lest you be blinded by the powerful sunshine. 

This was especially true, I should mention, if you were playing outfield.

A sonic boom rang in my ears like a gun shot blast. Wooden bat cracking leather with just the perfect amount of bite, sending echoes of its mighty collision radiating into the spaces between the houses that made up the parameter to our little make shift, backyard, vacant lot, baseball field. This sound, and the accompanying “oohs and ahhhs” of my friends, that would inevitably follow, acted like small fire alarms being set off in my head, with the despairing message to wake the hell up and get ready, glove up to the sky, or there’d be hell to pay for it. 

A pop fly, that slipped right between my legs, was sent skittering under the fence behind me, causing my heart to sink into my guts along with it. I frowned, tensing my shoulders and running after the ball to the theme music of boo’s and complaints from half of my friends, while the other half of them offered nothing but praise and cheers all around, thanking me for the assistance in helping them secure yet another home run on the day. I hate Baseball.  

Tommy Barnes (who was, to be fair, almost 4 years older than I was, and the soul reason we even needed an outfielder on our team, to begin with) began his victory lap around the established bases ( a con-jumbled hodge dodge of miscellaneous items and marker points roughly the same distance apart from one another, in some variation of the shape of a diamond.) He raised his arms in boisterous, swollen victory, surely basking in the glory of having achieved a third run in, courtesy of (kill) me.

Head bowed down, I jogged up to the rows of fences that lined the “backfield”, my gaze meeting the one in particular that the ball had slipped under, and I grimaced at the sight of the small shack of a house, that lied like a sleeping dragon behind its borders. I gulped at the sight of it. That was Jimmy Sauer’s yard.

I hated going into Jimmy Sauer’s yard. 

I took a deep breath, knowing full well that the consequences of stalling in this matter would soon be met with a barrage of heckling and complaints from the group as a whole, and so I steeled myself for the inevitable act of having put myself over that fence, one way, or another.
 
I swallowed hard, removed my cap and wiped the forming sweat off of my brow, and began the long climb, carefully maneuvering the tips of my Chuck Taylors into each new link of the fence, trying not to make a single sound in the process. 

At the top, I threw one leg over, then the other, and slid my way down into the yard, with my eyes practically glued to the back door of the house the entire time. As I connected with the dirt, feeling like an unlucky version of Neil Armstrong, a dust cloud puffed up from the dirt beneath my feet, filling my vision with its asmatic, brown smog. I waved it away vigorously with flailing arms, coughing into my T-shirt and shielding my eyes away from it.

There I was, in the eye of the storm, and the dread of every outfielder who ever missed a ball on Lineker Street; tasked with the retrieval from the absolute worst yard in the history of worst yards. See, The Sauer’s yard was a place you never wanted to find your ball behind, because Jimmy Sauer was a mean, awful man.

He was a drunk, for one thing, who yelled and hollered and threatened to shoot us with a shotgun full of rock salt that he kept handy for the birds… or children, if anyone was so brave (or stupid) enough to find themselves caught anywhere near his property. On top of it, talk around town was that he was a wife beater, and that people claim to have seen poor Mrs. Sauer with marks and bruises on her around the neighborhood from time to time. And on top of  all that, he was a giant. Jimmy Saruer was an absolute tower of a human being, skinny, wide and lanky, with broad shoulders and mean, scolding eyes that burned in his skull like two candles. In short, Jimmy Sauer was the boogey man of Lineker Street.

And I was in his yard. 

I gritted my teeth, imagining at least a dozen horrible possibilities of what lied within the ominous shadow cast into the darkened screen doorway at the top of those rickety, wooden steps, not fifteen feet from where I was standing. Regardless, I was ready to spring back up over that fence like a bat out of hell at the first sign of a creek I heard it make.

Truthfully, however, I think I was just as equally afraid of Tommy Barnes as I was of ole’ Jimmy Sauer, and coming back over that fence without a baseball meant having to face him. Meaning it wasn’t one of my options. See, I knew that even though Jimmy might chase me through his yard and holler up a storm the whole way through, I was little, and fast, and I never once saw him leave his property after one of us. Far as I knew, he might have never left his property at all. Tommy on the other hand, was mean, and liked shoving his weight around, especially on the smaller, younger guys in the group. He had a way about him that gave him the reputation of a guy who’d sooner knock the wind right out of you if you gave him half a reason to; and we all knew it.

“Damn it, Tommy” I groaned lowly under my breath, practically hovering past the doorway, like an alley cat creeping past a sleeping Rottweiler. “Where is this god damned ball”. Tentatively, I began working my way through the forest of tall grass and mangy, overgrown weeds that had all but completely conquered the Sauer’s yard over the years. Like a small jungle, more befitting of prehistoric times than anytime near the existence of the suburbs in our sleepy, little town. 
Suddenly, I heard something move behind me, and I snapped my head around, ready to spring at any moment. It was a crow, perching down onto the bumper of an old, burnt out Ford, rotting by the side of the house, coated with heavy blanketed rust from years of neglect. It had become permanently swallowed the perpetual, gnarly, brown color, as if it had contracted some kind of a plague. 
The whole yard in fact, was like a junk yard of forgotten things and unfinished projects —old motors and loose car tires, mostly. But some sections were just filled with tall piles of scrap metal, or miscellaneous trash bags stacked up in corners, filled with God knows what —if only there for no other purpose than to collect up rain and mosquitos until the end of times. Jimmy Sauer was a mechanic, on the rare chance he felt like workin’. Mostly he sat on his front porch drinking bourbon and listening to his radio, though. 

I exhaled, ignoring a growing urge to pick up and turn back tail. I could spin off some story about the ball disappearing down a drainage ditch, or into a crawl space. Anything to get me the hell out of that yard. To the staticky tune of my internal, nagging monologue, I stepped deeper into the brush, and thats when I saw it.

Something was in the yard, right beside me, hunched down in the tall grass. 

I froze, rocked up to my feet, and began inching myself away slowly. At the same time, I was digging into my shorts for my pocket knife.

The figure slowly rose, emerging from the grass as it craned its neck around to face me.
Its silhouette was short; maybe only as tall as I was, with messy, whitish, blonde hair and a large, bulbous face, with curving, moonlike cheeks that ran the length of its face smoothly. 

He was just a kid. 

His clothes were strange — a kind of body suit that was silver and red, seeming to form fit to his figure, which was slender and narrow, not too far off from my own. The clothes were mangled, and ripped in places, and his collar was torn badly, as if it were gripped up and worked out in some kind of a scuffle. Then I saw his eyes. 

They were way too small— practically the size of shirt buttons. Like tiny, yellow beads, with black dots in their centers, like pins. His nose was all wrong. Flattened down; basically nonexistent beyond its bridge, almost …melting. His mouth was normal enough for a person, but the skin around it and on the rest of his face was bizarre and inhuman. It sort of laid in layers on top of his skull, with a kind of moist, waxy, reddish-pink that was smeared all together beneath a kind of resin that sat smoothly at the surface. Like an old oil painting, hung in a museum, in three dimensions. As he got closer, I could see that the colors of his flesh were runny, seeping down inside the globe of their transparent surface, like a cheap, melting Halloween mask in a fish bowl. 

I leapt backward, feeling as if all of my breath had left my body at once, and struggled to speak. 
“Please, I —Look, I just wanted my ball” I begged, backing away with my hands out in front of me. I was clutching my knife tightly, and searching for the fence with my back, not daring to turn it to the creature. Its pea sized eyes and shining skin were glistening in the wet, summer heat, and it began approaching me. I backed away, my hand shaking badly, wobbling the blade like a weather vane. 

The creature stopped suddenly, lowering its head, as if scanning the ground beneath it, and reached into the weeds, pulling up the something into its hands. It presented it up to me.

It was the baseball.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. “J-just K- keep it” I shuddered, still backing away and searching desperately for the security of the fence behind me. Emotionlessly, the creature lowered the ball, again taking small steps in my direction. I picked up pace, but tripped on a stack of loosely coiled cables, and fell flat to my back, kicking up another dust storm all around me. I was thrust into a coughing fit, and frantically tried scrambling back up to my feet, becoming disoriented by the hazy dirt fog building up in the air like a wall in front of me. 
As it cleared, a child's hand appeared, right in front of my face, held out by the palm, as if offering to help me back to my feet. I started to scream, but quickly silenced myself, remembering where I was. Still on my back,I slid away, and my shoulders connected with the fence post. 

The creature continued toward me, walking casually through the fading smoke screen, its hand still outstretched in my direction. It was then that I noticed that its ears were sliding down its face. I screamed again, this time at full volume. It seemed to ignore this, and took another step forward, standing right in front of me.

“What do you want? Please, leave me alone!?” I cried, tears streaming into my cheeks. My heart was pounding, my stomach lurched with hysteria. The unforgiving blaze of sunshine was beating down on the both of us, catching everything under it within its brilliant rays, dispelling every crevice and corner, leaving no shadow large enough to hide inside of.

Once again, the creature held the baseball out to me. Then it opened its mouth, as if to speak. 

“Here. I think this is your ball”. Its voice was high and soft, like a child’s. The words smooth and gentle. There was nothing malicious or otherwise intimidating about them.

“Th-thank you.” I choked, taking the ball from its hand and holding it close to my chest, realizing I had nowhere to go. It didn’t seem to be angry, and I didn’t want to change that, either. 

“You’re welcome” it replied; its strange, tiny eyes staring into mine. Then, it was just standing there, not saying anything. A moment later, a small, white moth landed onto its shoulder, resting pleasantly upon it, as if it were a sleepy log. 

“Wha..who are you?” I asked, if for nothing else then to break the growing, uncomfortable silence building between us. My voice was unsteady, unnerved.

“I am Chip. It’s nice to meet you.” He held out a hand for me to shake. I hesitated, but again felt the hard, wooden fence post behind my back and decided I didn’t have much a choice. Reluctantly, I took his hand and shook it. 

“I’m … Billy” I croaked. “What are y… or uh, where did you come from”? I cleared my throat, trying to relax my body as he took a small step back from me, leaving enough room between us for me to stand up. I was looking for my moment to hop over the fence and scream for the guys to come help me.

He seemed to think about the question. Then lifted a hand, pointing a finger up in the air at the blue, cloudless sky. There wasn’t a building, an airplane, or even a bird to be seen above him. 

“…The sky?” I asked, squinting.

“Yes” He said, with a smirk, “Far away”. He opened his palm, making it flat, and ran it across the air in a slow, swooping motion in front of me, like he were painting a big, open picture.

“Uhm… Well, we really shouldn’t be back here, Chip. Mr. Sauer doesn’t like people in his yard.” I declared forebodingly, strategically, pointing up at the screen door.

“I know. I noticed that earlier. We met earlier this morning” Chip said, without taking his eyes off of mine. His way of speaking was almost stranger than his appearance. The words were correct, and he didn’t really have an accent, per se, but everything he said came out with a kind of clumsiness to it. Like he were only borrowing the words, and wasn’t sure quite how to organize them in his own mouth, yet.  

“You… met Jimmy Sauer?” I asked sheepishly, with disbelief, looking down at his outfit. 

“Yes. It was… unpleasant.” His face twisting uncomfortably as he said it.

“You can say that again” I agreed. I wiped my face, sneakily glancing over my shoulder to see if my friends had noticed how long I’d been gone, and if they were on their way over to check on me yet.

“You have met him, as well?” Chip asked in his strange tone. Again, the words fitting together all wrong, like a ransom note.
 
“Yeah… We —my friends and me. We play ball in that lot over there, and sometimes the ball goes over the fence and, well, you saw. But, yeah, he’s sort of… crazy.”

He nodded slowly. “Is that normal? To be crazy?”

Just then, I could hear a voice calling from behind me. It was probably George I thought, who was playing infield that day. “What’s the hold up!” he hollered; or something to that effect.

“I should go. My friends are waiting.” I said with phony sympathy, like a person escaping from an unwanted conversation in a grocery store. I knew the minute I went over that fence, I would run for my life, not turning back; at least not until I was at home, with the door bolted and my back up against it, screaming for my mother.

Chip was silent momentarily, then replied, “Okay. It was nice to meet you.” His posture degraded slightly when he said it, his tone reducing. He sounded… almost sad.

I turned around, mounted the fence, and paused, letting out a sigh. As crazy as it sounded, for some reason, I felt morbidly inclined to ask him something in that moment. Maybe it was that he was going to be stuck in Jimmy Sauer’s yard once I left, and that he seemed to be in some sort of a state of distress, the way his clothes looked. The way the rest of him looked… nobody should be left there in that shape. Especially alone. Really, it was much more likely that curiosity had gotten the better of me. If this strange, inhuman looking creature was really from… “far away”, this may’ve been my only chance to find out more about it, I thought. The thought of that felt irresistible to me. Like a hidden secret of the universe. Besides, he was going to let me leave. So, he didn’t really want to hurt me, right?

 “Wait, uhm, Chip?” I asked, scratching at my throat.

“Yes?” He replied, seeming to perk up a bit, when I said it. 

“Are you saying you’re a… like you’re from another planet?” I was finding myself more desperately curious than before now. About a dozen questions were following up inside my head, as my fear was beginning to momentarily transform into a kind of bizarre fascination over the boy.

“Well, no, not exactly. We don’t really live on planets, actually. We kind of just travel through the galaxies. The elements and the gravity on most planets are hard on our bodies.” He lifted his arms and looked down, presenting himself as evidence. 

“Like in U.F.  … or uh, in space ships?""

“Nope. Just our bodies. We follow the patterns of the stars to try and travel in sync with them.”

“You’re… an alien, then” I said, flatly. It was funny —The word felt almost demeaning, when I said it. Like it may be taken as a slur. 

He thought about it for a moment, then replied, “Yeah, I guess I am.” 

“So there's… more of you, then? Are they here? On Earth? What are you doing here?” I was no longer halfway up the fence. I was far too wrapped up with the boy and his answers now. I was like a mad reporter, conducting the interview of a lifetime.

“We’re supposed to be finding out if the life here is dangerous.” He said. 

“If we’re… dangerous?”

“Yes. We want to come here, for a celebration. Uhm… kind of like a marriage. So we are making sure it’s safe and the people here are ready for that.”

“Oh…” I replied, thoroughly dumbfounded by the information, as I attempted to decode it. All the while, I couldn’t stop staring at his ungodly features, and the way he was speaking, and the things he was saying. It was all so surreal. Could he really be an alien? Was I the first person to have a conversation with an alien?
Just then, the  screen door at the top of steps burst open, and behind it was none other than  Jimmy Sauer himself, looking mad as hell, directly at me. Beside him, was a big, metal hammer knotted all up in his fist. Without so much as a word, he started up after us, barreling down the stairs straight toward me. 

“You little mother fuckers! I’ll cave yours head in!” He roared, raising the hammer high over his head. It disappeared into the white blaze of the midmorning sun. Jimmy’s eyes were glazed over, red and puffy; a sleepless haze of aggression and drunken fog, steam rolling straight for me with a kind of vicious focus that I didn’t like the look of one bit.

I screamed, breaking for the fence, shooting my feet up the links hectically. But I was panicking and couldn’t get my grip to catch. Behind me, the thunderous beat of steady boot stomps were fast approaching, getting louder with every passing second, met by an explosion of steel scrap, as he kicked over a pile of loose sheet metal, stacked up in his path. Then, it stopped suddenly. 

I spun around, scrambling for the knife, hands shaking like a seizure, only to find that Jimmy Sauer was standing completely still, frozen stiff, as if he were made of stone, right in front of me. His hammer still raised up over his shoulder, crusty overalls sagging loosely around his chest and waist, one of their detached flaps swaying ever so gently in the faint summer breeze.

“Chip, come on. We gotta go!” I cried out with urgency, not stopping to make any sense of things. I once again began making futile, fidgety leaps up the fence post. 

“It’s okay” Chip replied, calmly. “He’ll stay like that a while.” 
I looked up, seeing that Jimmy was still standing, not moving a muscle. It was like he was in a trance. 

Chip sat down, crossing his legs, and leaned his body back, pressing his hands out behind him, planting them down in the weeds. 

“How did you… or did …You did this?” I was flabbergasted. My mouth was dry, my chest pounding like a drum.

“Yeah. It’s just a kind of a trick. He isn’t hurt or anything.” 

“B-but how?” I asked with a shiver, slowly redirecting my gaze back from Chip toward this new, frozen Jimmy. He was staring straight ahead, a mean grimace on his mug, his eyes still petulant with detached anger. As much as I preferred him this way, admittedly, I still held my knife tightly, not taking any chances that he wouldn’t snap out of it at any moment and try and cave my head in. 

“It’s just something I can do. He isn’t actually stuck like that, or anything. He just thinks he is.”

I swallowed. “H-He thinks he is?”
 
“Yeah, same as those kids over there. I did that a few minutes ago.” Chip pointed behind me, toward the vacant lot.

I stiffened, slowly craning my neck to face the field. The whole lot of them, jogging up toward Jimmy’s fence, only at the same time, they weren't. Instead, they were all standing perfectly still, stretched out in running poses, fists pumped up by their sides, and totally static in place —just like Jimmy. It was like they were a photograph, a picture framed in time. Only it were real. Andy, the second baseman from down the street, had fallen over, still holding his strange mock running position, from flat on his side. Like a fallen mannequin. It was unnerving.

“What are you doing to them?!” I cried. My brain started running off into a million places at once; a whirlwind of panic and disbelief overtaking my senses. “Please, don’t hurt them. I’ll help you, whatever you need. Please. What do you want?” 

Chip looked surprised by all of my frantic shouting. “What do I want?” He asked,
as if taken off guard by the question. “Nobody has asked me that before, actually.”

I didn’t say anything. I felt as frozen as the others. The only difference being that mine was due to raw fear, and not whatever kind of horrible possession was happening to all of them.

Chip looked up at me a moment, then back down at the patch of grass in front of his knees. A caterpillar was passing by him, and he placed his finger in its path, allowing it to climb up onto his hand. He studied the creature, observing each of its movements closely, beneath his eyes. 
“I want to leave” he said. 

“Leave?” 

“Yes. I don’t want to be here, anymore”. He continued watching the caterpillar’s body rise and fall in its little linear waves, as it inched its way around his wrist. Carefully, he set it back down into the grass, where he’d found it.

“Why do you say that?” I asked, defiantly. Hearing the harshness in my tone, I tried to readjust it, not wanting to sound aggressive, or to give Chip a reason to think I was, anyway. I sat down, trying to mirror Chip’s position on the ground. I figured it was best to make him feel that I was on his side. Lest I end up stuck in time, like the others.

“Well… I don’t know. Nobody has ever asked me that, either. Where I come from, we don’t really do that. You just do what you are doing, in a big group. Everybody flows with the direction of things. That’s how it has to be, or we would all fall apart. Let me think about it a minute.” He stared back down at the dirt, puttering with the tips of the grass blades. “I think it’s because of the people here.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked, watching him carefully. Even thoroughly gripped in intense unease of the present moment, my curiosity was still peeking over everything he was saying and doing.

“Well, everyone I meet here either seems to be afraid of me, or angry all the time.” When he said that, it was the first time I thought he sounded like a real person. Like he was confused. “I didn’t know it would be like this.”

I noticed several more caterpillars had started to gravitate around him. A colony of ants was fast behind them, sort of falling into an orbit around his knees. I wondered if they were trying to eat his melting body.

I snapped out of my thoughts and replied cooly, “Yeah, you can say that again. But we aren’t all bad, you know. Some people, I think are just kind of confused, or stressed out. My Mom and Dad have stress, and that’s why they fight a lot. Because of stress. But we aren’t all bad, you know. I have to ask you something, Chip.”

“Go ahead” he replied, smiling calmly. Butterflies had begun to land on his shoulders and head, resting in his hair.

 You aren’t going to… hurt me, right? Or hurt my friends?” I was almost afraid to ask. It was addressing the elephant in the room, and putting the tension of the whole situation on the both of us, I thought.  But I couldn’t help myself. The weight of it was pressing on my chest, like an anvil.

“No, I don’t hurt people.” His gaze widened, as if he were somewhat stunned by such an accusation. Once again, I noted his smoothness of the english dialect improving.

“Okay. That’s good”. I felt like I was negotiating a hostage situation. I wiped the pooling sweat from my palms, down the front of my jeans. “So, you said you were here for a celebration. Why here? Why Earth?” 

“The atmosphere on this planet is beautiful. It’s the perfect temperature, and life is everywhere. There are no other planets like that in the universe. It would be a wonderful experience, and many advantages in the opportunity to share in all of this.” More bugs were appearing. Mosquitoes had gathered nearly a dozen strong on his face and neck. Spiders and water bugs and stink bugs and even more caterpillars were crawling in from every direction. A garter snake had slithered up beside him, joining the small army of creatures seamlessly. Chip seemed completely unfazed by any of this, only occasionally holding out a finger for a gentle interaction with a mouse or a beetle. 

“And, you’re here to see if it’s… dangerous. Like the people, and the animals and stuff?” I couldn’t take my eyes off of the mass of critters accumulating into its little parade around his lap. A shadow hit my eye and I looked up to see that there were several different species of birds now beginning to circle from above. Something else I had never seen before. 

Yes, and when I am done reporting, I will be allowed back up to join my people, who will judge my experience”. Flowers were beginning to bloom. Jimmy Sauer’s yard, usually nothing more than a desolate scarp heap, devoid of any life, save for the tall weeds and mossy algae gathering up on stones and old rust buckets, was now blooming bright with new life. Electric purple violets and rainbows of wild flowers, right before my eyes, forming into a crown around Chips feet.

“Woah… The flowers” I said, slack jawed, eyes widening.

He looked around him, touched a finger to one of the flowers, and it bloomed instantly, exploding with vibrant colors and bright, healthy looking petals. “Flowers” He repeated, as if more to himself than to me.

“So wait, they… your people sent you here… For how long? Are there more of you here?”

“Yes, there are thirty five of us here, on Earth. We are collecting different data; experiences, and then, we will be taken back up. For a kind of jury service. They will judge our experiences.” In the time we had sat there, Chip’s nose, or whatever was left of his nose, had seemed to dissolve into itself, melting into a blob before simply sliding into his pours, smoothing over, into nothing at all. 

“Your face” I swallowed, trying not to look alarmed. 

“Yes. I have been here for a few days. We can’t survive here for very long. It will be soon, now. This body is kind of like a disguise. A costume.”

“But, aren’t you just a kid. Like me?” He thought about this a while, trying to understand the sentiment.

“Yes and no” He said, smiling faintly, blooming more wildflowers with his finger tips around him like a game of connect the dots.

Jimmy Sauer moaned lowly from over my shoulder, as in a kid of slow, quiet agony. He was pouring with sweat, his face and shoulders glistening in the sunshine. A crow had landed on his shoulder, and begun pecking at his face, pulling away small pieces of his lips. 
His eyes still stared angrily, straight ahead, not so much as a wiggle from them. It made me grimace.

""Chip! The crow!” I cried. 

Chip watched him for a moment. A second crow had joined the first, squawking loudly in Jimmy’s ear and pecking his eye ball hard, causing blood to shoot out of it and spray out onto his forearm. Again he moaned, and again, he did nothing. Suddenly, the crows too, were frozen in place.


I breathed out a sigh of relief, staring at them, at Jimmy. My fists slowly unclenching. “Are we, Chip? Are we dangerous?”

He looked over at Jimmy Sauer, then back at me. “I am still reporting. And even when I’m done, it won’t be my judgement to make. I am not here to judge. I am just here to experience.” The flowers had quickly morphed into a tiny forest around Chip’s feet, making up the shape of a halo. The grass had grown taller and brighter, even the dead patches of yard teeming with vibrating greens and florescent blues. It was like he were sitting in a living Easter basket.

“Okay. Well, I mean, besides Jimmy Sauer, obviously… Have people been nice? Have you talked to anybody else?”

“I have only met five people.”

“Okay. And were they nice? Mean?” I asked shyly, as if embarrassed for the state of my own species.

“I don’t really understand this, nice. I suppose by definition, it means not dangerous”. A butterfly landed square on the center of his face, blocking his vision. He didn’t stop it, or even flinch. “The first person was a man with a dog. The dog barked at me, and the man was blind. He didn’t pay me much attention. The second person was a girl, who ran by me, while she was exercising. The third was a man, in a forest, who was very strange. And then today I met the two of you” he said, pointing to both Jimmy and me. The two of us being put into even the same sentence gave me a chill of disgust. 

“Well, Jimmy is a bad example. He’s sick in the head. My dad says he’s got wet brain, on account of he drinks so much.”

“Yes. His brain is quite damaged” Chip concurred. Two white rabbits had joined into his fan club. Both of them moving into the caravan of circling critters that looped around his waist in a stampede, as the never ending garden of tiny, beautiful flowers bloomed into mass. It was both mesmerizing and terribly unsettling.

“Okay, so besides Jimmy… I’m nice. And what about the girl jogging? Was she nice? And what happened with this man in the park? Did he say anything to you?”

“Nice” Chip repeated. He sat thoughtfully, waist deep in his nest of flowers. “You are nice. Yes. The woman said hello to me, then continued running. The man in the park was different, though.” Chip’s eyes did something they hadn’t done before. They sort of darted around, like they were fidgeting. Like he was uncomfortable.

“What happened?” I asked.

“He approached me, and asked me if I was alone. And I told him yes. He asked if I was lost, and if anybody knew where I was, and I told him that I wasn't lost, and that nobody knew where I was. He grabbed me by my hand and walked with me a long distance, out into the forest. He pulled me by the arm into a place where there were a lot of bushes and trees, and started to remove all of my clothes, and told me to stay quiet. When I was undressed, he held me down on the ground with his body.”

I listened in horror as Chip described it to me. I wanted to scream. He gave every horrible detail that I won’t ever repeat, in such a way that made me believe he had no idea what had happened to him, or how wrong it was on every level. The man in the woods had molested and raped him, before stabbing him several times, and leaving him there, for dead. 

After recounting his merciless experience, Chip lifted his shirt, presenting six open stab wounds around his chest and abdomen, most of them torn into the space just beneath his rib cage. There wasn’t a single drop of blood to be found anywhere around them. Instead, within the gaping holes, were light purple streaks of dry, rippling flesh, moving in intricate, interwoven patterns beneath his waxy exterior, like a series of intricately arranged rubber bands. 

“Oh my god! Chip!” I shouted, covering my mouth with both hands. More tears filled my eyes and my stomach twisted into knots. I wanted to jump up and run. I wanted to scream for help. But I couldn’t. I was just staring at these unbleeding, vicious stab wounds covering the length of the boys torso. And maybe most distressing of all, was that through all of it, he only stared back at me, absently, as if merely perplexed by my reaction to his injuries, and nothing more; a silent observer to all of my horror. 

“You are nice.” He said, quietly. 

I stared into his beading eyes, my heart filling with a kind of compassionate sorrow that I’m not even sure I was capable of at the time. I didn’t know what I could do about any of this. I was just a kid and it all felt so over my head, and I just cried and cried. 

Chip continued observing me a while, eventually leaning in, reaching an arm out toward my face. With one finger, he scooped up one of the tears rolling along my cheek, and brought it up to his eye line, as if to study it. 

“He wasn’t nice” Chip uttered softly. His eyes, to my surprise, had now begun filling in with tears of their own.

We cried like that together for several minutes, surrounded by the human statues and the growing parade of circling creatures, and the ever blossoming emergence of colorful flowers. 

I snorted, wiping the tears away from my face with a wrist. I wanted to ask him if he could be picked up early. If he could seek help from his people. If there was anything I could do to help him. I felt powerless. I felt afraid. So instead, I squeaked out the only other thing that was on my mind. Like the buzzing of an angry hornet in my brain. “Chip, what happens if you go home and tell your people everything, and they think we are dangerous? What will they do?”

There was a short silence. He sat thoughtfully, as if contemplating where or not he should share the information with me. A moment later, he replied “Mass extinction.” He said it without emotion. A giant, black spider, with long, sharp legs was crawling across the space between his eyes.

“They’ll …kill everyone?” I choked, the words seeping out of me like a leak in a tire.

“Yes. It’s the way we have always dealt with dangerous species. Since, forever.”

I twitched, my bottom lip quivering. “Oh. I see. Well, you… you told me that I’m nice, right? And… and my friends are nice. And you know, that man in the woods, he was horrible, but he’s not…”

He interrupted me. The first time he had done so all day. “Do you know that your friends were going to kill me with their baseball bats, if I hadn’t stopped them? Some of them would have urinated on me.”

Stunned and mortified by his words, I shouted back at him without thinking, “That isn’t true!” Somewhere in the back of my mind, I pictured Tommy Barnes completely capable of exactly this kind of behavior. “We aren’t like that. Not all humans are bad! You have to believe me!”

Slowly, he rose from his place in the crown of bright flowers. “I know that. And I know that you are nice. I am so happy I met you, Billy.” The birds circling overhead cooed and began dispersing, fanning out into their separate directions before taking off, disappearing from view. The parade of circling animals broke apart and skittered into the weeds chaotically, some of them crawling past my feet or flying by my head. 

Still covered in a small mass of butterflies and other assorted critters resting all over his shoulders and face, Chip approached me. I started to stand, and the sun shined into my eyes. I pulled my hat down over my cheeks to shield it away, and as I pulled the brim back up, I saw that I was now on the other side of Jimmy Sauers fence, back in the vacant lot, my friends only a few yards away from me. They seemed disoriented, confused; scratching their heads and spinning themselves in circles trying to figure out what had just happened.

 By my feet was my baseball, resting in the grass. Around it, a ring of tiny, blue orchids and multicolored wild flowers, formed in a small halo.

I spun around to face The Sauer’s yard, searching for Chip, and for Jimmy, for that matter, but neither of them were anywhere to be seen. Then I heard a door slam, and saw that Jimmy was in his house now, standing in the shadow of his doorway, behind the screen. He stared at me, and I stared at him, but neither of us said anything. His lips and eye were still bleeding, profusely. Slowly, he shut the door behind him. That was the last time I saw Jimmy Sauer.

Six months later, he was dead of cancer. 

Rumor had it, that he had a head full of tumors, and that it was like nothing any of the doctors had ever seen before. Seemed to come on out of nowhere, or that’s what I heard. 
I stopped hanging out with all of those kids from the field that day, pretty much all together by the end of summer. I was too paranoid, for one thing. Whether or not Chip was right in his prediction about them and their malicious intentions toward him, I didn’t know —and might never know. But I wasn’t gonna take the risk of being lumped in with a single one of them if he was. It was good decision, looking back. 

They weren’t nice.

I’ve since moved away from my little vacant lot baseball home town, and surrounded myself with better people over the years. Most of the time, thankfully, with people how are kind, and a little more tolerant. I pride myself on trying to be a better person too, when I can help it. At the very least I try to be the total opposite of a Jimmy Sauer, or even a Tommy Barnes for that matter, whenever possible. 

I never saw Chip again after that day, or any of the supposed others he claimed to be roaming the planet, pretending to be humans. 
 
But some nights, I look up at the sky, or around a crowed mall, or at a baseball game, and I’ll wonder if they’re out there, somewhere. If they’re watching us. Or if they are already here, celebrating. Or if one day, we’ll all freeze in place suddenly —left defenseless for days, or even weeks at a time, as food for the birds. Maybe we’ll just all show up with a head full of tumors one day. Maybe it will only be those of us deemed dangerous who aren’t spared.

I don’t know. And honestly, I’m okay with never finding out. But I’ll tell you one thing. I’ve met a lot of people I wouldn’t want to introduce to Chip, over the years. And I sure hope whoever he and his people ran into after me weren’t one of them. Maybe it was you. 
So, what do you think? 

What about you?

&lt;p&gt;It was a bright, sunny, summer day. One where you had to squint hard to see anything above the brim of your own cap, lest you be blinded by the powerful sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was especially true, I should mention, if you were playing outfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sonic boom rang in my ears like a gun shot blast. Wooden bat cracking leather with just the perfect amount of bite, sending echoes of its mighty collision radiating into the spaces between the houses that made up the parameter to our little make shift, backyard, vacant lot, baseball field. This sound, and the accompanying “oohs and ahhhs” of my friends, that would inevitably follow, acted like small fire alarms being set off in my head, with the despairing message to wake the hell up and get ready, glove up to the sky, or there’d be hell to pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pop fly, that slipped right between my legs, was sent skittering under the fence behind me, causing my heart to sink into my guts along with it. I frowned, tensing my shoulders and running after the ball to the theme music of boo’s and complaints from half of my friends, while the other half of them offered nothing but praise and cheers all around, thanking me for the assistance in helping them secure yet another home run on the day. I hate Baseball.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy Barnes (who was, to be fair, almost 4 years older than I was, and the soul reason we even needed an outfielder on our team, to begin with) began his victory lap around the established bases ( a con-jumbled hodge dodge of miscellaneous items and marker points roughly the same distance apart from one another, in some variation of the shape of a diamond.) He raised his arms in boisterous, swollen victory, surely basking in the glory of having achieved a third run in, courtesy of (kill) me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head bowed down, I jogged up to the rows of fences that lined the “backfield”, my gaze meeting the one in particular that the ball had slipped under, and I grimaced at the sight of the small shack of a house, that lied like a sleeping dragon behind its borders. I gulped at the sight of it. That was Jimmy Sauer’s yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated going into Jimmy Sauer’s yard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath, knowing full well that the consequences of stalling in this matter would soon be met with a barrage of heckling and complaints from the group as a whole, and so I steeled myself for the inevitable act of having put myself over that fence, one way, or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swallowed hard, removed my cap and wiped the forming sweat off of my brow, and began the long climb, carefully maneuvering the tips of my Chuck Taylors into each new link of the fence, trying not to make a single sound in the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top, I threw one leg over, then the other, and slid my way down into the yard, with my eyes practically glued to the back door of the house the entire time. As I connected with the dirt, feeling like an unlucky version of Neil Armstrong, a dust cloud puffed up from the dirt beneath my feet, filling my vision with its asmatic, brown smog. I waved it away vigorously with flailing arms, coughing into my T-shirt and shielding my eyes away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I was, in the eye of the storm, and the dread of every outfielder who ever missed a ball on Lineker Street; tasked with the retrieval from the absolute worst yard in the history of worst yards. See, The Sauer’s yard was a place you never wanted to find your ball behind, because Jimmy Sauer was a mean, awful man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a drunk, for one thing, who yelled and hollered and threatened to shoot us with a shotgun full of rock salt that he kept handy for the birds… or children, if anyone was so brave (or stupid) enough to find themselves caught anywhere near his property. On top of it, talk around town was that he was a wife beater, and that people claim to have seen poor Mrs. Sauer with marks and bruises on her around the neighborhood from time to time. And on top of  all that, he was a giant. Jimmy Saruer was an absolute tower of a human being, skinny, wide and lanky, with broad shoulders and mean, scolding eyes that burned in his skull like two candles. In short, Jimmy Sauer was the boogey man of Lineker Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was in his yard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gritted my teeth, imagining at least a dozen horrible possibilities of what lied within the ominous shadow cast into the darkened screen doorway at the top of those rickety, wooden steps, not fifteen feet from where I was standing. Regardless, I was ready to spring back up over that fence like a bat out of hell at the first sign of a creek I heard it make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, however, I think I was just as equally afraid of Tommy Barnes as I was of ole’ Jimmy Sauer, and coming back over that fence without a baseball meant having to face him. Meaning it wasn’t one of my options. See, I knew that even though Jimmy might chase me through his yard and holler up a storm the whole way through, I was little, and fast, and I never once saw him leave his property after one of us. Far as I knew, he might have never left his property at all. Tommy on the other hand, was mean, and liked shoving his weight around, especially on the smaller, younger guys in the group. He had a way about him that gave him the reputation of a guy who’d sooner knock the wind right out of you if you gave him half a reason to; and we all knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Damn it, Tommy” I groaned lowly under my breath, practically hovering past the doorway, like an alley cat creeping past a sleeping Rottweiler. “Where is this god damned ball”. Tentatively, I began working my way through the forest of tall grass and mangy, overgrown weeds that had all but completely conquered the Sauer’s yard over the years. Like a small jungle, more befitting of prehistoric times than anytime near the existence of the suburbs in our sleepy, little town. 
Suddenly, I heard something move behind me, and I snapped my head around, ready to spring at any moment. It was a crow, perching down onto the bumper of an old, burnt out Ford, rotting by the side of the house, coated with heavy blanketed rust from years of neglect. It had become permanently swallowed the perpetual, gnarly, brown color, as if it had contracted some kind of a plague. 
The whole yard in fact, was like a junk yard of forgotten things and unfinished projects —old motors and loose car tires, mostly. But some sections were just filled with tall piles of scrap metal, or miscellaneous trash bags stacked up in corners, filled with God knows what —if only there for no other purpose than to collect up rain and mosquitos until the end of times. Jimmy Sauer was a mechanic, on the rare chance he felt like workin’. Mostly he sat on his front porch drinking bourbon and listening to his radio, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exhaled, ignoring a growing urge to pick up and turn back tail. I could spin off some story about the ball disappearing down a drainage ditch, or into a crawl space. Anything to get me the hell out of that yard. To the staticky tune of my internal, nagging monologue, I stepped deeper into the brush, and thats when I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something was in the yard, right beside me, hunched down in the tall grass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I froze, rocked up to my feet, and began inching myself away slowly. At the same time, I was digging into my shorts for my pocket knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure slowly rose, emerging from the grass as it craned its neck around to face me.
Its silhouette was short; maybe only as tall as I was, with messy, whitish, blonde hair and a large, bulbous face, with curving, moonlike cheeks that ran the length of its face smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was just a kid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His clothes were strange — a kind of body suit that was silver and red, seeming to form fit to his figure, which was slender and narrow, not too far off from my own. The clothes were mangled, and ripped in places, and his collar was torn badly, as if it were gripped up and worked out in some kind of a scuffle. Then I saw his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were way too small— practically the size of shirt buttons. Like tiny, yellow beads, with black dots in their centers, like pins. His nose was all wrong. Flattened down; basically nonexistent beyond its bridge, almost …melting. His mouth was normal enough for a person, but the skin around it and on the rest of his face was bizarre and inhuman. It sort of laid in layers on top of his skull, with a kind of moist, waxy, reddish-pink that was smeared all together beneath a kind of resin that sat smoothly at the surface. Like an old oil painting, hung in a museum, in three dimensions. As he got closer, I could see that the colors of his flesh were runny, seeping down inside the globe of their transparent surface, like a cheap, melting Halloween mask in a fish bowl. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leapt backward, feeling as if all of my breath had left my body at once, and struggled to speak. 
“Please, I —Look, I just wanted my ball” I begged, backing away with my hands out in front of me. I was clutching my knife tightly, and searching for the fence with my back, not daring to turn it to the creature. Its pea sized eyes and shining skin were glistening in the wet, summer heat, and it began approaching me. I backed away, my hand shaking badly, wobbling the blade like a weather vane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature stopped suddenly, lowering its head, as if scanning the ground beneath it, and reached into the weeds, pulling up the something into its hands. It presented it up to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. “J-just K- keep it” I shuddered, still backing away and searching desperately for the security of the fence behind me. Emotionlessly, the creature lowered the ball, again taking small steps in my direction. I picked up pace, but tripped on a stack of loosely coiled cables, and fell flat to my back, kicking up another dust storm all around me. I was thrust into a coughing fit, and frantically tried scrambling back up to my feet, becoming disoriented by the hazy dirt fog building up in the air like a wall in front of me. 
As it cleared, a child&amp;#39;s hand appeared, right in front of my face, held out by the palm, as if offering to help me back to my feet. I started to scream, but quickly silenced myself, remembering where I was. Still on my back,I slid away, and my shoulders connected with the fence post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature continued toward me, walking casually through the fading smoke screen, its hand still outstretched in my direction. It was then that I noticed that its ears were sliding down its face. I screamed again, this time at full volume. It seemed to ignore this, and took another step forward, standing right in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you want? Please, leave me alone!?” I cried, tears streaming into my cheeks. My heart was pounding, my stomach lurched with hysteria. The unforgiving blaze of sunshine was beating down on the both of us, catching everything under it within its brilliant rays, dispelling every crevice and corner, leaving no shadow large enough to hide inside of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the creature held the baseball out to me. Then it opened its mouth, as if to speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here. I think this is your ball”. Its voice was high and soft, like a child’s. The words smooth and gentle. There was nothing malicious or otherwise intimidating about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Th-thank you.” I choked, taking the ball from its hand and holding it close to my chest, realizing I had nowhere to go. It didn’t seem to be angry, and I didn’t want to change that, either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re welcome” it replied; its strange, tiny eyes staring into mine. Then, it was just standing there, not saying anything. A moment later, a small, white moth landed onto its shoulder, resting pleasantly upon it, as if it were a sleepy log. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wha..who are you?” I asked, if for nothing else then to break the growing, uncomfortable silence building between us. My voice was unsteady, unnerved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am Chip. It’s nice to meet you.” He held out a hand for me to shake. I hesitated, but again felt the hard, wooden fence post behind my back and decided I didn’t have much a choice. Reluctantly, I took his hand and shook it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m … Billy” I croaked. “What are y… or uh, where did you come from”? I cleared my throat, trying to relax my body as he took a small step back from me, leaving enough room between us for me to stand up. I was looking for my moment to hop over the fence and scream for the guys to come help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seemed to think about the question. Then lifted a hand, pointing a finger up in the air at the blue, cloudless sky. There wasn’t a building, an airplane, or even a bird to be seen above him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…The sky?” I asked, squinting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes” He said, with a smirk, “Far away”. He opened his palm, making it flat, and ran it across the air in a slow, swooping motion in front of me, like he were painting a big, open picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Uhm… Well, we really shouldn’t be back here, Chip. Mr. Sauer doesn’t like people in his yard.” I declared forebodingly, strategically, pointing up at the screen door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know. I noticed that earlier. We met earlier this morning” Chip said, without taking his eyes off of mine. His way of speaking was almost stranger than his appearance. The words were correct, and he didn’t really have an accent, per se, but everything he said came out with a kind of clumsiness to it. Like he were only borrowing the words, and wasn’t sure quite how to organize them in his own mouth, yet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You… met Jimmy Sauer?” I asked sheepishly, with disbelief, looking down at his outfit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. It was… unpleasant.” His face twisting uncomfortably as he said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can say that again” I agreed. I wiped my face, sneakily glancing over my shoulder to see if my friends had noticed how long I’d been gone, and if they were on their way over to check on me yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have met him, as well?” Chip asked in his strange tone. Again, the words fitting together all wrong, like a ransom note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah… We —my friends and me. We play ball in that lot over there, and sometimes the ball goes over the fence and, well, you saw. But, yeah, he’s sort of… crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded slowly. “Is that normal? To be crazy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then, I could hear a voice calling from behind me. It was probably George I thought, who was playing infield that day. “What’s the hold up!” he hollered; or something to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I should go. My friends are waiting.” I said with phony sympathy, like a person escaping from an unwanted conversation in a grocery store. I knew the minute I went over that fence, I would run for my life, not turning back; at least not until I was at home, with the door bolted and my back up against it, screaming for my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip was silent momentarily, then replied, “Okay. It was nice to meet you.” His posture degraded slightly when he said it, his tone reducing. He sounded… almost sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned around, mounted the fence, and paused, letting out a sigh. As crazy as it sounded, for some reason, I felt morbidly inclined to ask him something in that moment. Maybe it was that he was going to be stuck in Jimmy Sauer’s yard once I left, and that he seemed to be in some sort of a state of distress, the way his clothes looked. The way the rest of him looked… nobody should be left there in that shape. Especially alone. Really, it was much more likely that curiosity had gotten the better of me. If this strange, inhuman looking creature was really from… “far away”, this may’ve been my only chance to find out more about it, I thought. The thought of that felt irresistible to me. Like a hidden secret of the universe. Besides, he was going to let me leave. So, he didn’t really want to hurt me, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait, uhm, Chip?” I asked, scratching at my throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes?” He replied, seeming to perk up a bit, when I said it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you saying you’re a… like you’re from another planet?” I was finding myself more desperately curious than before now. About a dozen questions were following up inside my head, as my fear was beginning to momentarily transform into a kind of bizarre fascination over the boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, no, not exactly. We don’t really live on planets, actually. We kind of just travel through the galaxies. The elements and the gravity on most planets are hard on our bodies.” He lifted his arms and looked down, presenting himself as evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Like in U.F.  … or uh, in space ships?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nope. Just our bodies. We follow the patterns of the stars to try and travel in sync with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re… an alien, then” I said, flatly. It was funny —The word felt almost demeaning, when I said it. Like it may be taken as a slur. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought about it for a moment, then replied, “Yeah, I guess I am.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So there&amp;#39;s… more of you, then? Are they here? On Earth? What are you doing here?” I was no longer halfway up the fence. I was far too wrapped up with the boy and his answers now. I was like a mad reporter, conducting the interview of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re supposed to be finding out if the life here is dangerous.” He said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we’re… dangerous?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. We want to come here, for a celebration. Uhm… kind of like a marriage. So we are making sure it’s safe and the people here are ready for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh…” I replied, thoroughly dumbfounded by the information, as I attempted to decode it. All the while, I couldn’t stop staring at his ungodly features, and the way he was speaking, and the things he was saying. It was all so surreal. Could he really be an alien? Was I the first person to have a conversation with an alien?
Just then, the  screen door at the top of steps burst open, and behind it was none other than  Jimmy Sauer himself, looking mad as hell, directly at me. Beside him, was a big, metal hammer knotted all up in his fist. Without so much as a word, he started up after us, barreling down the stairs straight toward me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You little mother fuckers! I’ll cave yours head in!” He roared, raising the hammer high over his head. It disappeared into the white blaze of the midmorning sun. Jimmy’s eyes were glazed over, red and puffy; a sleepless haze of aggression and drunken fog, steam rolling straight for me with a kind of vicious focus that I didn’t like the look of one bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I screamed, breaking for the fence, shooting my feet up the links hectically. But I was panicking and couldn’t get my grip to catch. Behind me, the thunderous beat of steady boot stomps were fast approaching, getting louder with every passing second, met by an explosion of steel scrap, as he kicked over a pile of loose sheet metal, stacked up in his path. Then, it stopped suddenly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spun around, scrambling for the knife, hands shaking like a seizure, only to find that Jimmy Sauer was standing completely still, frozen stiff, as if he were made of stone, right in front of me. His hammer still raised up over his shoulder, crusty overalls sagging loosely around his chest and waist, one of their detached flaps swaying ever so gently in the faint summer breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chip, come on. We gotta go!” I cried out with urgency, not stopping to make any sense of things. I once again began making futile, fidgety leaps up the fence post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay” Chip replied, calmly. “He’ll stay like that a while.” 
I looked up, seeing that Jimmy was still standing, not moving a muscle. It was like he was in a trance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip sat down, crossing his legs, and leaned his body back, pressing his hands out behind him, planting them down in the weeds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How did you… or did …You did this?” I was flabbergasted. My mouth was dry, my chest pounding like a drum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. It’s just a kind of a trick. He isn’t hurt or anything.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“B-but how?” I asked with a shiver, slowly redirecting my gaze back from Chip toward this new, frozen Jimmy. He was staring straight ahead, a mean grimace on his mug, his eyes still petulant with detached anger. As much as I preferred him this way, admittedly, I still held my knife tightly, not taking any chances that he wouldn’t snap out of it at any moment and try and cave my head in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s just something I can do. He isn’t actually stuck like that, or anything. He just thinks he is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swallowed. “H-He thinks he is?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, same as those kids over there. I did that a few minutes ago.” Chip pointed behind me, toward the vacant lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stiffened, slowly craning my neck to face the field. The whole lot of them, jogging up toward Jimmy’s fence, only at the same time, they weren&amp;#39;t. Instead, they were all standing perfectly still, stretched out in running poses, fists pumped up by their sides, and totally static in place —just like Jimmy. It was like they were a photograph, a picture framed in time. Only it were real. Andy, the second baseman from down the street, had fallen over, still holding his strange mock running position, from flat on his side. Like a fallen mannequin. It was unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing to them?!” I cried. My brain started running off into a million places at once; a whirlwind of panic and disbelief overtaking my senses. “Please, don’t hurt them. I’ll help you, whatever you need. Please. What do you want?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip looked surprised by all of my frantic shouting. “What do I want?” He asked,
as if taken off guard by the question. “Nobody has asked me that before, actually.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t say anything. I felt as frozen as the others. The only difference being that mine was due to raw fear, and not whatever kind of horrible possession was happening to all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip looked up at me a moment, then back down at the patch of grass in front of his knees. A caterpillar was passing by him, and he placed his finger in its path, allowing it to climb up onto his hand. He studied the creature, observing each of its movements closely, beneath his eyes. 
“I want to leave” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Leave?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. I don’t want to be here, anymore”. He continued watching the caterpillar’s body rise and fall in its little linear waves, as it inched its way around his wrist. Carefully, he set it back down into the grass, where he’d found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why do you say that?” I asked, defiantly. Hearing the harshness in my tone, I tried to readjust it, not wanting to sound aggressive, or to give Chip a reason to think I was, anyway. I sat down, trying to mirror Chip’s position on the ground. I figured it was best to make him feel that I was on his side. Lest I end up stuck in time, like the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well… I don’t know. Nobody has ever asked me that, either. Where I come from, we don’t really do that. You just do what you are doing, in a big group. Everybody flows with the direction of things. That’s how it has to be, or we would all fall apart. Let me think about it a minute.” He stared back down at the dirt, puttering with the tips of the grass blades. “I think it’s because of the people here.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?” I asked, watching him carefully. Even thoroughly gripped in intense unease of the present moment, my curiosity was still peeking over everything he was saying and doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, everyone I meet here either seems to be afraid of me, or angry all the time.” When he said that, it was the first time I thought he sounded like a real person. Like he was confused. “I didn’t know it would be like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed several more caterpillars had started to gravitate around him. A colony of ants was fast behind them, sort of falling into an orbit around his knees. I wondered if they were trying to eat his melting body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snapped out of my thoughts and replied cooly, “Yeah, you can say that again. But we aren’t all bad, you know. Some people, I think are just kind of confused, or stressed out. My Mom and Dad have stress, and that’s why they fight a lot. Because of stress. But we aren’t all bad, you know. I have to ask you something, Chip.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Go ahead” he replied, smiling calmly. Butterflies had begun to land on his shoulders and head, resting in his hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You aren’t going to… hurt me, right? Or hurt my friends?” I was almost afraid to ask. It was addressing the elephant in the room, and putting the tension of the whole situation on the both of us, I thought.  But I couldn’t help myself. The weight of it was pressing on my chest, like an anvil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, I don’t hurt people.” His gaze widened, as if he were somewhat stunned by such an accusation. Once again, I noted his smoothness of the english dialect improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay. That’s good”. I felt like I was negotiating a hostage situation. I wiped the pooling sweat from my palms, down the front of my jeans. “So, you said you were here for a celebration. Why here? Why Earth?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The atmosphere on this planet is beautiful. It’s the perfect temperature, and life is everywhere. There are no other planets like that in the universe. It would be a wonderful experience, and many advantages in the opportunity to share in all of this.” More bugs were appearing. Mosquitoes had gathered nearly a dozen strong on his face and neck. Spiders and water bugs and stink bugs and even more caterpillars were crawling in from every direction. A garter snake had slithered up beside him, joining the small army of creatures seamlessly. Chip seemed completely unfazed by any of this, only occasionally holding out a finger for a gentle interaction with a mouse or a beetle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And, you’re here to see if it’s… dangerous. Like the people, and the animals and stuff?” I couldn’t take my eyes off of the mass of critters accumulating into its little parade around his lap. A shadow hit my eye and I looked up to see that there were several different species of birds now beginning to circle from above. Something else I had never seen before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, and when I am done reporting, I will be allowed back up to join my people, who will judge my experience”. Flowers were beginning to bloom. Jimmy Sauer’s yard, usually nothing more than a desolate scarp heap, devoid of any life, save for the tall weeds and mossy algae gathering up on stones and old rust buckets, was now blooming bright with new life. Electric purple violets and rainbows of wild flowers, right before my eyes, forming into a crown around Chips feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Woah… The flowers” I said, slack jawed, eyes widening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked around him, touched a finger to one of the flowers, and it bloomed instantly, exploding with vibrant colors and bright, healthy looking petals. “Flowers” He repeated, as if more to himself than to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So wait, they… your people sent you here… For how long? Are there more of you here?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, there are thirty five of us here, on Earth. We are collecting different data; experiences, and then, we will be taken back up. For a kind of jury service. They will judge our experiences.” In the time we had sat there, Chip’s nose, or whatever was left of his nose, had seemed to dissolve into itself, melting into a blob before simply sliding into his pours, smoothing over, into nothing at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your face” I swallowed, trying not to look alarmed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. I have been here for a few days. We can’t survive here for very long. It will be soon, now. This body is kind of like a disguise. A costume.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But, aren’t you just a kid. Like me?” He thought about this a while, trying to understand the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes and no” He said, smiling faintly, blooming more wildflowers with his finger tips around him like a game of connect the dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Sauer moaned lowly from over my shoulder, as in a kid of slow, quiet agony. He was pouring with sweat, his face and shoulders glistening in the sunshine. A crow had landed on his shoulder, and begun pecking at his face, pulling away small pieces of his lips. 
His eyes still stared angrily, straight ahead, not so much as a wiggle from them. It made me grimace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Chip! The crow!” I cried. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip watched him for a moment. A second crow had joined the first, squawking loudly in Jimmy’s ear and pecking his eye ball hard, causing blood to shoot out of it and spray out onto his forearm. Again he moaned, and again, he did nothing. Suddenly, the crows too, were frozen in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I breathed out a sigh of relief, staring at them, at Jimmy. My fists slowly unclenching. “Are we, Chip? Are we dangerous?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked over at Jimmy Sauer, then back at me. “I am still reporting. And even when I’m done, it won’t be my judgement to make. I am not here to judge. I am just here to experience.” The flowers had quickly morphed into a tiny forest around Chip’s feet, making up the shape of a halo. The grass had grown taller and brighter, even the dead patches of yard teeming with vibrating greens and florescent blues. It was like he were sitting in a living Easter basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay. Well, I mean, besides Jimmy Sauer, obviously… Have people been nice? Have you talked to anybody else?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have only met five people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay. And were they nice? Mean?” I asked shyly, as if embarrassed for the state of my own species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really understand this, nice. I suppose by definition, it means not dangerous”. A butterfly landed square on the center of his face, blocking his vision. He didn’t stop it, or even flinch. “The first person was a man with a dog. The dog barked at me, and the man was blind. He didn’t pay me much attention. The second person was a girl, who ran by me, while she was exercising. The third was a man, in a forest, who was very strange. And then today I met the two of you” he said, pointing to both Jimmy and me. The two of us being put into even the same sentence gave me a chill of disgust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, Jimmy is a bad example. He’s sick in the head. My dad says he’s got wet brain, on account of he drinks so much.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. His brain is quite damaged” Chip concurred. Two white rabbits had joined into his fan club. Both of them moving into the caravan of circling critters that looped around his waist in a stampede, as the never ending garden of tiny, beautiful flowers bloomed into mass. It was both mesmerizing and terribly unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, so besides Jimmy… I’m nice. And what about the girl jogging? Was she nice? And what happened with this man in the park? Did he say anything to you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nice” Chip repeated. He sat thoughtfully, waist deep in his nest of flowers. “You are nice. Yes. The woman said hello to me, then continued running. The man in the park was different, though.” Chip’s eyes did something they hadn’t done before. They sort of darted around, like they were fidgeting. Like he was uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What happened?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He approached me, and asked me if I was alone. And I told him yes. He asked if I was lost, and if anybody knew where I was, and I told him that I wasn&amp;#39;t lost, and that nobody knew where I was. He grabbed me by my hand and walked with me a long distance, out into the forest. He pulled me by the arm into a place where there were a lot of bushes and trees, and started to remove all of my clothes, and told me to stay quiet. When I was undressed, he held me down on the ground with his body.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened in horror as Chip described it to me. I wanted to scream. He gave every horrible detail that I won’t ever repeat, in such a way that made me believe he had no idea what had happened to him, or how wrong it was on every level. The man in the woods had molested and raped him, before stabbing him several times, and leaving him there, for dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After recounting his merciless experience, Chip lifted his shirt, presenting six open stab wounds around his chest and abdomen, most of them torn into the space just beneath his rib cage. There wasn’t a single drop of blood to be found anywhere around them. Instead, within the gaping holes, were light purple streaks of dry, rippling flesh, moving in intricate, interwoven patterns beneath his waxy exterior, like a series of intricately arranged rubber bands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god! Chip!” I shouted, covering my mouth with both hands. More tears filled my eyes and my stomach twisted into knots. I wanted to jump up and run. I wanted to scream for help. But I couldn’t. I was just staring at these unbleeding, vicious stab wounds covering the length of the boys torso. And maybe most distressing of all, was that through all of it, he only stared back at me, absently, as if merely perplexed by my reaction to his injuries, and nothing more; a silent observer to all of my horror. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are nice.” He said, quietly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared into his beading eyes, my heart filling with a kind of compassionate sorrow that I’m not even sure I was capable of at the time. I didn’t know what I could do about any of this. I was just a kid and it all felt so over my head, and I just cried and cried. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip continued observing me a while, eventually leaning in, reaching an arm out toward my face. With one finger, he scooped up one of the tears rolling along my cheek, and brought it up to his eye line, as if to study it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He wasn’t nice” Chip uttered softly. His eyes, to my surprise, had now begun filling in with tears of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cried like that together for several minutes, surrounded by the human statues and the growing parade of circling creatures, and the ever blossoming emergence of colorful flowers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snorted, wiping the tears away from my face with a wrist. I wanted to ask him if he could be picked up early. If he could seek help from his people. If there was anything I could do to help him. I felt powerless. I felt afraid. So instead, I squeaked out the only other thing that was on my mind. Like the buzzing of an angry hornet in my brain. “Chip, what happens if you go home and tell your people everything, and they think we are dangerous? What will they do?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a short silence. He sat thoughtfully, as if contemplating where or not he should share the information with me. A moment later, he replied “Mass extinction.” He said it without emotion. A giant, black spider, with long, sharp legs was crawling across the space between his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’ll …kill everyone?” I choked, the words seeping out of me like a leak in a tire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. It’s the way we have always dealt with dangerous species. Since, forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I twitched, my bottom lip quivering. “Oh. I see. Well, you… you told me that I’m nice, right? And… and my friends are nice. And you know, that man in the woods, he was horrible, but he’s not…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He interrupted me. The first time he had done so all day. “Do you know that your friends were going to kill me with their baseball bats, if I hadn’t stopped them? Some of them would have urinated on me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stunned and mortified by his words, I shouted back at him without thinking, “That isn’t true!” Somewhere in the back of my mind, I pictured Tommy Barnes completely capable of exactly this kind of behavior. “We aren’t like that. Not all humans are bad! You have to believe me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, he rose from his place in the crown of bright flowers. “I know that. And I know that you are nice. I am so happy I met you, Billy.” The birds circling overhead cooed and began dispersing, fanning out into their separate directions before taking off, disappearing from view. The parade of circling animals broke apart and skittered into the weeds chaotically, some of them crawling past my feet or flying by my head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still covered in a small mass of butterflies and other assorted critters resting all over his shoulders and face, Chip approached me. I started to stand, and the sun shined into my eyes. I pulled my hat down over my cheeks to shield it away, and as I pulled the brim back up, I saw that I was now on the other side of Jimmy Sauers fence, back in the vacant lot, my friends only a few yards away from me. They seemed disoriented, confused; scratching their heads and spinning themselves in circles trying to figure out what had just happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By my feet was my baseball, resting in the grass. Around it, a ring of tiny, blue orchids and multicolored wild flowers, formed in a small halo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spun around to face The Sauer’s yard, searching for Chip, and for Jimmy, for that matter, but neither of them were anywhere to be seen. Then I heard a door slam, and saw that Jimmy was in his house now, standing in the shadow of his doorway, behind the screen. He stared at me, and I stared at him, but neither of us said anything. His lips and eye were still bleeding, profusely. Slowly, he shut the door behind him. That was the last time I saw Jimmy Sauer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months later, he was dead of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumor had it, that he had a head full of tumors, and that it was like nothing any of the doctors had ever seen before. Seemed to come on out of nowhere, or that’s what I heard. 
I stopped hanging out with all of those kids from the field that day, pretty much all together by the end of summer. I was too paranoid, for one thing. Whether or not Chip was right in his prediction about them and their malicious intentions toward him, I didn’t know —and might never know. But I wasn’t gonna take the risk of being lumped in with a single one of them if he was. It was good decision, looking back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They weren’t nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve since moved away from my little vacant lot baseball home town, and surrounded myself with better people over the years. Most of the time, thankfully, with people how are kind, and a little more tolerant. I pride myself on trying to be a better person too, when I can help it. At the very least I try to be the total opposite of a Jimmy Sauer, or even a Tommy Barnes for that matter, whenever possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never saw Chip again after that day, or any of the supposed others he claimed to be roaming the planet, pretending to be humans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some nights, I look up at the sky, or around a crowed mall, or at a baseball game, and I’ll wonder if they’re out there, somewhere. If they’re watching us. Or if they are already here, celebrating. Or if one day, we’ll all freeze in place suddenly —left defenseless for days, or even weeks at a time, as food for the birds. Maybe we’ll just all show up with a head full of tumors one day. Maybe it will only be those of us deemed dangerous who aren’t spared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. And honestly, I’m okay with never finding out. But I’ll tell you one thing. I’ve met a lot of people I wouldn’t want to introduce to Chip, over the years. And I sure hope whoever he and his people ran into after me weren’t one of them. Maybe it was you. 
So, what do you think? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you nice?&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"Three months ago, one of my best friends, Tommy, died.

It was a suicide.

Very unlike him, though, what do I know? Maybe I wasn’t the only one who got fucked up during our service. He mentioned a few times he draws whatever haunts his nightmares. I have no idea how often he drew for this reason. He used to draw a lot in general; mostly positive stuff. He was pretty damn good at it too. I remember we used to joke about how he should’ve become a comic book illustrator because of his style of drawing and his skill with the pen.

Tommy was a positive man; you could never tell something was wrong with him. Other than the usual stuff, everyone goes through. Life’s never only about the ups – obviously, there are downs too.

Then again, more often than not, you wouldn’t be able to tell if a person’s dealing with demons or not unless they were open about it.

Tom went out in the worst way imaginable.

It wasn’t like him.

Wasn’t like him at all.

He apparently sliced his arms open and bled out; to put it simply.

It wasn’t that simple; however, I’d imagine.

When I was told, I could come by his place and pick out whatever I’d like to take with me as a memento, I was told I’d better stay out of his room. For my own sake. I wasn’t sure how to feel about that statement when I first heard it. Cassie, his sister. She was the one who told me I should keep out of there.

She called it hell.

When I came by two weeks after Tom’s passing, I made it a point to check out his room. It was like this itch that I couldn’t scratch. I had to see what he left behind. I had to know what all the fuss was about. There’s no way it was as bad as Cassie was saying, right? These were the words of a grieving sister. I thought there was no way it would be too bad. Just a few blood stains here and there and a massive pool of the dried-up crimson liquid somewhere. I’ve seen worse – I’ve done worse.

Hoo boy, how fucking wrong I was… Quite frankly, Cassandra wasn’t exaggerating, not in the slightest.

The room was a total mess, I’ll say this much; I’ve never thought there’d be so much in a single human being. Thomas wasn’t even the biggest of guys. He was pretty average in terms of his overall volume, I guess, I could say.

There was blood everywhere.

It was all over the floor, on the walls, on his desk, staining his bed sheets.

The worst part was there were words written in blood all over the room; I couldn’t decipher them, which is probably for the better.

No, I’m lying, that’s not the worst part.

Even the smell wasn’t the worst part of it. I guess if the whole place didn’t make me feel so on edge, I’d find the stench incredibly sickening. The whole room reeked a mix of rotten flesh, eggs and stinging touches of iron.

Probably the worst thing I’ve ever smelled, but it wasn’t what bothered me the most.

Somehow.

For some reason, the moment I stepped through the front door, I felt myself tense up. I thought it was just the mood of it all. Being inside the house of someone you knew that ended up offing themselves. It wasn’t that; grief and a moody atmosphere do not make you feel you’re being watched.

Yeah…

I felt like I was being watched the whole time I was there.

That’s probably the reason I made sure I thoroughly checked out every last inch of the house; just to make sure there was no one in there. I guess old habits die hard.

The whole place felt as if it was out of this world. In a sense that there was no time; no flow, like it was thrown out of reality and set in a dark corner of its own. Like it was stuck in its own sort of dimension; forsake by any higher power that might exist.

It felt heavy in there; physically heavy. Like someone or something, turned up the gravitational forces inside that estate.

I felt as if I was being crushed by the apartment itself.

Like it was alive.

Like it didn’t want me there.

I couldn’t leave though, not until I’ve seen Tommy’s room. I had to see what happened; I suppose it was some sense of morbid curiosity. I’d say the animalistic part inside of me was trying to mess with my civilized part. Maybe the devil on my shoulder tried to one-up the angel on my other shoulder. I think I just wanted to see what the death of one of my best friends looked like.

Maybe somewhere deep inside I wanted to pay him my final respects like that.

I don’t know…

Anyway, I made it to his room, hardly; the apartment was sucking the life out of me. I found myself stopping and staring at a wall in every wall. It’s like I was waiting for something to crawl out and come at me. I might’ve been hoping for something like that. I guess it’d be easier to accept Tom’s death if it came at the hands of some monster as opposed to his own.

Grief is a fucked-up thing.

Thomas’ room was truly hell however, there was blood everywhere.

It was all over the floor, on the walls, on his desk, staining his bed sheets.

So much blood.

I was afraid.

I could feel my heart trying to escape my cage with anxiety.

I was having another fit.

I needed a moment. I knew it was just another fit. I haven’t been good with stress those last few years.

I know I’ve a problem; and well, I can’t fix it just yet. I refuse to dig deep inside the pit that is my soul and pull out all the shit to the surface and deal with it as I should.

I just can’t.

I had to sit down and give myself a moment of respite.

I ended up sitting down on Tommy’s bed, and for a moment I thought I could see him standing next to his desk, next to a covered canvas. I was sure for about a second. I saw my friend standing there. Talking to me.

My mind went blank for a moment.

It wasn’t a hallucination, or anything of that sort. I was just trying to deal with the loss, my mind making up bullshit to cope better.

It hurt so much… I felt the tears roll down my cheeks.

I felt kind of good for about a millisecond.

Then a knock came from the window. It quite literally made me jump. I have been so zoned out a soft knock on the window jolted me upright. I could feel my muscles petrify with tension. I turned towards the window facing me from across the room and I was sure I’m going to piss myself.

She was just standing there, knocking on the window whilst staring at me…

From the inside…

Seeing her felt like taking a knife to the chest.

She just stood there; knocking gently and smiling.

That fucking smile.

That wasn’t a human smile…

Too wide, way too wide…

And her eyes; aloof, dead empty… Yet so sharp, like daggers.

I felt as if she was digging at my insides with her eyes…

I just stood there frozen, like a scared child, I had every right to be a scared child at that moment.

She seemed so real and yet almost ethereal; and no, she wasn’t transparent or anything.

Solid.

She was solid.

I could see the withering of the edges of her cloak, it’s like it was made up of pitch-black tentacles.

I couldn’t even utter a sound in her presence.

She just pointed her finger at the covered canvas, and I involuntarily shifted my gaze towards it. My body moved on its own, ignoring my internal screams.

As I looked at it; the cover slipped down and fell to the floor; revealing a drawing, a crude representation of hers. Draw in a disgusting reddish brown, nearly black color.

I was mesmerized by the artistic abomination.

My eyes were locked on that thing.

Suddenly, the knocking stopped, and the uneasiness began to wash away.

I turned back to the window, and the bitch was gone.

I was alone again.

Not willing to risk it, I grabbed the canvas and bolted out of the estate.

I had no idea why I took the damned thing; I just did.

It’s like something inside snapped and I knew I had to take it with me.

A sort of primal call or something, I don’t know.

I was pretty sure I had a fit so bad I was hallucinating, but no, the painting is real; it’s still disgusting to look at from a distance. I feel like I’m being punched in the guts if I look at it for longer than few seconds. Can’t even stand close to that thing. It makes me sick to my stomach because of the awful smell. I’ve an awful idea of what it’s made of. The dye, that is.

I would rather not think about it…

I really hope I’m wrong about this thing, but...

I’m pretty sure I’m losing my mind ever since I’ve gotten this thing; I can keep hearing someone walking around the house when I’m alone. Heck, I’ve even seen my dog randomly wiggling her tail as if someone’s approaching her when there’s no one there.

I keep hearing someone audibly breathe from time to time.

I live alone.

I keep having nightmares about people opening themselves up and using their own blood to paint all these awful images of indescribable terrors.

I don't even want to think about that shit.

I even woke up the other night seeing something stand in the corner of my room. It was this short, rather humanoid shadow, but it was withering at the edges. I couldn’t move, I was frozen with fear. I was fully awake, seated up, facing that shadow thing.

I think it noticed me, and then expanded itself. I was sure I’m having another nightmare, but then the thing enveloped my whole bedroom. For a quick moment everything turned black, and I felt a wave of frozen air rush through me. I was drowning in the cold sensation; I couldn’t breathe.

My lungs just froze.

A second later, everything returned to normal.

Couldn’t sleep for the rest of that night or the following night.

I’m always on edge…

Anxious more often than not.

Everyone around me thinks I’m losing it.

They’re probably right.

I feel like there’s a crushing atmospheric force trying to crack my fucking body open whenever I step into the garage where the bloody canvas stands.

Everything started with that thing.

I’ve to get rid of it.

I think I’m going to throw the bloody canvas.

I’m going to get rid of that thing once the feeling of someone standing behind me goes away.",t2_nhkbe,False,,0,False,Dead Man's Canvas,[],r/nosleep,False,6,flair-trigger,0,False,t3_fh7qar,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Self Harm,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1584002707.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months ago, one of my best friends, Tommy, died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very unlike him, though, what do I know? Maybe I wasn’t the only one who got fucked up during our service. He mentioned a few times he draws whatever haunts his nightmares. I have no idea how often he drew for this reason. He used to draw a lot in general; mostly positive stuff. He was pretty damn good at it too. I remember we used to joke about how he should’ve become a comic book illustrator because of his style of drawing and his skill with the pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy was a positive man; you could never tell something was wrong with him. Other than the usual stuff, everyone goes through. Life’s never only about the ups – obviously, there are downs too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, more often than not, you wouldn’t be able to tell if a person’s dealing with demons or not unless they were open about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom went out in the worst way imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasn’t like him at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He apparently sliced his arms open and bled out; to put it simply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t that simple; however, I’d imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was told, I could come by his place and pick out whatever I’d like to take with me as a memento, I was told I’d better stay out of his room. For my own sake. I wasn’t sure how to feel about that statement when I first heard it. Cassie, his sister. She was the one who told me I should keep out of there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She called it hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came by two weeks after Tom’s passing, I made it a point to check out his room. It was like this itch that I couldn’t scratch. I had to see what he left behind. I had to know what all the fuss was about. There’s no way it was as bad as Cassie was saying, right? These were the words of a grieving sister. I thought there was no way it would be too bad. Just a few blood stains here and there and a massive pool of the dried-up crimson liquid somewhere. I’ve seen worse – I’ve done worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoo boy, how fucking wrong I was… Quite frankly, Cassandra wasn’t exaggerating, not in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room was a total mess, I’ll say this much; I’ve never thought there’d be so much in a single human being. Thomas wasn’t even the biggest of guys. He was pretty average in terms of his overall volume, I guess, I could say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all over the floor, on the walls, on his desk, staining his bed sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part was there were words written in blood all over the room; I couldn’t decipher them, which is probably for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I’m lying, that’s not the worst part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the smell wasn’t the worst part of it. I guess if the whole place didn’t make me feel so on edge, I’d find the stench incredibly sickening. The whole room reeked a mix of rotten flesh, eggs and stinging touches of iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the worst thing I’ve ever smelled, but it wasn’t what bothered me the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the moment I stepped through the front door, I felt myself tense up. I thought it was just the mood of it all. Being inside the house of someone you knew that ended up offing themselves. It wasn’t that; grief and a moody atmosphere do not make you feel you’re being watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was being watched the whole time I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s probably the reason I made sure I thoroughly checked out every last inch of the house; just to make sure there was no one in there. I guess old habits die hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole place felt as if it was out of this world. In a sense that there was no time; no flow, like it was thrown out of reality and set in a dark corner of its own. Like it was stuck in its own sort of dimension; forsake by any higher power that might exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt heavy in there; physically heavy. Like someone or something, turned up the gravitational forces inside that estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt as if I was being crushed by the apartment itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it was alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it didn’t want me there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t leave though, not until I’ve seen Tommy’s room. I had to see what happened; I suppose it was some sense of morbid curiosity. I’d say the animalistic part inside of me was trying to mess with my civilized part. Maybe the devil on my shoulder tried to one-up the angel on my other shoulder. I think I just wanted to see what the death of one of my best friends looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe somewhere deep inside I wanted to pay him my final respects like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I made it to his room, hardly; the apartment was sucking the life out of me. I found myself stopping and staring at a wall in every wall. It’s like I was waiting for something to crawl out and come at me. I might’ve been hoping for something like that. I guess it’d be easier to accept Tom’s death if it came at the hands of some monster as opposed to his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grief is a fucked-up thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas’ room was truly hell however, there was blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all over the floor, on the walls, on his desk, staining his bed sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could feel my heart trying to escape my cage with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having another fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a moment. I knew it was just another fit. I haven’t been good with stress those last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’ve a problem; and well, I can’t fix it just yet. I refuse to dig deep inside the pit that is my soul and pull out all the shit to the surface and deal with it as I should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to sit down and give myself a moment of respite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up sitting down on Tommy’s bed, and for a moment I thought I could see him standing next to his desk, next to a covered canvas. I was sure for about a second. I saw my friend standing there. Talking to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind went blank for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a hallucination, or anything of that sort. I was just trying to deal with the loss, my mind making up bullshit to cope better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurt so much… I felt the tears roll down my cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt kind of good for about a millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a knock came from the window. It quite literally made me jump. I have been so zoned out a soft knock on the window jolted me upright. I could feel my muscles petrify with tension. I turned towards the window facing me from across the room and I was sure I’m going to piss myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was just standing there, knocking on the window whilst staring at me…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the inside…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing her felt like taking a knife to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just stood there; knocking gently and smiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fucking smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t a human smile…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too wide, way too wide…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And her eyes; aloof, dead empty… Yet so sharp, like daggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt as if she was digging at my insides with her eyes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just stood there frozen, like a scared child, I had every right to be a scared child at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seemed so real and yet almost ethereal; and no, she wasn’t transparent or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see the withering of the edges of her cloak, it’s like it was made up of pitch-black tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t even utter a sound in her presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just pointed her finger at the covered canvas, and I involuntarily shifted my gaze towards it. My body moved on its own, ignoring my internal screams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I looked at it; the cover slipped down and fell to the floor; revealing a drawing, a crude representation of hers. Draw in a disgusting reddish brown, nearly black color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mesmerized by the artistic abomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes were locked on that thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the knocking stopped, and the uneasiness began to wash away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned back to the window, and the bitch was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was alone again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not willing to risk it, I grabbed the canvas and bolted out of the estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea why I took the damned thing; I just did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like something inside snapped and I knew I had to take it with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sort of primal call or something, I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty sure I had a fit so bad I was hallucinating, but no, the painting is real; it’s still disgusting to look at from a distance. I feel like I’m being punched in the guts if I look at it for longer than few seconds. Can’t even stand close to that thing. It makes me sick to my stomach because of the awful smell. I’ve an awful idea of what it’s made of. The dye, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather not think about it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope I’m wrong about this thing, but...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure I’m losing my mind ever since I’ve gotten this thing; I can keep hearing someone walking around the house when I’m alone. Heck, I’ve even seen my dog randomly wiggling her tail as if someone’s approaching her when there’s no one there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing someone audibly breathe from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep having nightmares about people opening themselves up and using their own blood to paint all these awful images of indescribable terrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even want to think about that shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even woke up the other night seeing something stand in the corner of my room. It was this short, rather humanoid shadow, but it was withering at the edges. I couldn’t move, I was frozen with fear. I was fully awake, seated up, facing that shadow thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it noticed me, and then expanded itself. I was sure I’m having another nightmare, but then the thing enveloped my whole bedroom. For a quick moment everything turned black, and I felt a wave of frozen air rush through me. I was drowning in the cold sensation; I couldn’t breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lungs just froze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second later, everything returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couldn’t sleep for the rest of that night or the following night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always on edge…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxious more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone around me thinks I’m losing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re probably right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like there’s a crushing atmospheric force trying to crack my fucking body open whenever I step into the garage where the bloody canvas stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything started with that thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to throw the bloody canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to get rid of that thing once the feeling of someone standing behind me goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"My grandfather was dying. It hadn’t come as any great shock. A year prior he’d got the diagnosis the family were dreading-dementia. My great uncle had had it too and my grandmother, both dead. Within the year the physical effects were starting to take their toll. His memory was slipping more often. He was still at home but a nurse came every day. At least twice a week I’d pop in after work to see him.

Some days it was good. He was the grandfather I remembered. Witty and charming, a genuine twinkle in his eyes and a bit cheeky to anyone and everyone. He’d tell me stories like he used to about his days as a fisherman in the bay and the weird assortment of friends he’d collected over the years. Other days were bad. On the best of the bad he’d sit silently, maybe mumbling to himself. On the worst he’d rant about how poorly he thought Harold Wilson was doing as Prime Minister, even though the man had been dead for twenty five years.

A week before he died I left work early and drove over to to the little cul-de-sac he lived in. The nurse was just leaving.

‘Hello.’

‘Hello, you going in to see him?’

‘Yeah.’

‘He’s on pretty good form today.’

‘OK,’ I said, ‘good good.’

The nurse left and I ventured inside. He was laid back in his usual chair, looking out through the large living room bay window. Beyond the hills outside was the usual strip of blue, a glimpse of the sea blending into sky.

‘Hello granddad,’ I said.

‘Hello Chris,’ he said.

I went over, hugged him hello then headed to the kitchen, newly spotless after the nurse’s visit, to make tea. He took his cup with shaky hands and took a sip immediately with a satisfied sigh.

‘You make a good cup.’

‘Thanks granddad.’

‘How was work?’

I shrugged, ‘Usual stuff I guess. Nothing too exciting.’

‘A job’s a job.’

‘Exactly.’

He sat up in his chair and sighed as his bones creaked with the strain.

‘And how’s that girlfriend of yours?’

I smiled as he chuckled to himself. My suspicions, never confirmed, were that my grandfather had been a bit of a ladies man in his day, at least before meeting my grandmother. Although he hadn’t met Beth yet the fact I’d finally found someone I clearly liked brought him some quiet sense of pleasure, at least when he could remember who Beth was. They’d never met but I thought he’d have liked her.

‘She’s good. I’m picking her up in an hour.’

‘Don’t let me keep you here,’ my grandfather said.

‘No, no. Plenty of time.’

‘You’ve got to live life whilst you can. It’ll go quick.’

I nodded.

‘Sounds like a cliché because it is but that doesn’t mean it’s not true,’ he muttered.

My grandfather looked out the window and took another gulp of his tea.

‘Things’ll happen in your life that’ll be on your mind forever. But if you have a good girl like-’

He waved his arm.

‘Beth?’

‘Yes,’ he said, ‘like Beth, if you have someone like Beth with you you’ll be happy. Where’d you meet her again?’

‘Just walking along by the beach.’

‘Walking?’

‘Yeah. She just started talking to me.’

‘She talked to you?’

I nodded. I’d told him the story a few times but he couldn’t seem to pin down the details.

‘Well,’ he said, ‘very forward. But that’s what they’re like these days. It sounds better.’

My grandfather chuckled again, then stopped. I followed his eyes to the television sat directly in front of him. It was off. Only his reflection bounced back. His head jerked round to look at me.

‘Your job pay well?’

I shrugged, ‘It’s a start really, it pays OK.’

His head jerked back. I watched as his left hand found his right and began to pick at a loose strand of dead skin.

‘Beth’s job actually pays better,’ I said.

‘You’ve got to be able to look after her and yourself.’

I said nothing but nodded again and took a sip of tea. My grandfather gulped down the remnants of his own.

‘Did your parents talk to you about the fish drought in 1959?’

‘No.’

‘It was bad that year. But you’ve got to provide for people. It was before your mother was born of course. She might not remember though I’m sure we must have mentioned it.’

His hand twisted the skin back and forth.

‘All the fish started drying up. The stocks.’

‘Oh right. Like now? Declining?’

‘No. They all went. Very quick. We weren’t that big back then. It was a proper village, not like now. Only a few thousand I suppose,’ my grandfather said.

I sat forward to listen to another tale from the sea. Many of them were funny but my grandfather’s eyes seemed dull. He was somewhere else.

‘We’d been married, your grandmother and me, but your mother was a year off or so. I’d been fishing for, oh, five years proper by then, but longer really. I was working on Jim Grant’s boat. We noticed within a week. Less and less of a catch.’

‘Right.’

‘It took us about a week and a bit till we realised everyone was the same. Nobody was having luck. Markets were practically empty in the mornings. A few people from the London restaurants were coming down to buy up everything we had before any locals could.’

I took another sip, ‘What was causing it?’

‘Well,’ my grandfather began before a long sigh, ‘we looked in the papers and listened to the radio but there was nothing. We thought something had spilled but no. We were getting desperate by then, having to go further and further out. Jim and me and the rest of the lads went out for four days at one point and we caught basically nothing. No one else seemed to have problems.’

‘Four days? Wow.’

‘That’s nothing nowadays but back then you’d venture out for a day at most really. People were getting hungry. Your grandmother was hungry. Some people came from the council to test the waters but they were fine.’

I put my empty cup down and inched forward in the chair. He’d started to trail off again but snapped back to look at me, his hands still working the skin.

‘Anyway, the lads pulled together, which was something but we were panicking, I don’t mind telling you Chris. Jim’s wife Mary worked out who was behind it. Anne Lockwood.’

I frowned and resisted a raised eyebrow.

‘She’d got herself involved with a fellow named Harry Woodley who worked on a boat. I didn’t know him very well. But, you-well, he was one of us. And Harry Woodley had enough of Anne Lockwood one day and got rid of her.’

‘They broke up you mean?’

My grandfather nodded, ‘Yeah. He’d two timed her possibly, I’m not sure. But Anne Lockwood was a witch.’

I winced and my grandfather switched his hands. He began to crack his knuckles, or attempt to anyway.

‘You shouldn’t say that about people granddad.’

‘Not a bitch, a witch.’

‘A witch?’ I asked.

‘Yes.’

I sighed, as silently as I could, and rolled my eyes privately.

‘People knew about her doing that sort of thing. Her mother and grandmother had been the same. I didn’t know her personally, possibly your grandmother did but not well, mind, but she was a witch, everyone knew. But it was all nonsense stuff. Curing colds and warts and things.’

I sighed again but my grandfather was back in the story.

‘But this was different. Harry Woodley had broken her heart I suppose but she decided to take it out on all of us, instead of just him. I’m sure she meant it just for us, I mean fishermen, but then she must have realised we fed the whole place. If we starved everyone did.’

‘I’m sorry granddad-’

‘She poisoned the seas, you see? She cursed it. The fish or the sea or both. We weren’t sure exactly. She was into something darker than we thought. She was angry enough to hurt us all.’

I hid my face as best I could as he went on, still fiddling with his knuckles.

‘We realised it was her. Everyone worked it out because she went round telling them. Harry Woodley knew straight away but we didn’t believe him, course, but when she went round telling everyone in the pub she’d cursed our fish, cursed the whole stock, just laughing about it. That’s hard to ignore. We begged her to stop.’

I watched his hands. He strapped each one to the sides of his chair and stared back at the television.

‘We tried to tell her. We did. Properly time and again but she wouldn’t listen. She must have been hungry herself but I don’t know, when you can do that to the sea I’m sure money doesn’t matter. We told her time and again you’ve got to stop. We need the fish, our wives need the fish, our mothers as well. But she wouldn’t listen. Jim’s Mary was pregnant at the time and she was really worried.’

‘D’you want another cup of tea granddad?’

‘We had to do what we did. I don’t feel good about it but that’s what was. We took her out, me and Jim Grant, and Terry and Mark and some others. We sailed right out, halfway to France really. She told us we’d suffer for it, or if we didn’t our loved ones would. Said there’d be rep, uh, repar, you know, reparations to pay. But by then, considering how difficult it was at home Chris, we had to try. She weighed down easily. We expected something but she just floated down like any other person.’

I tried to catch my grandfather’s face but it was practically sunken it was so far away. His arms shook as they clung onto the chair.

‘When we got back, day later, the fish were already back. Another week and the stocks were normal again. Course, we should have believed Anne Lockwood about paying for it. Nothing happened first but when Terry had his accident, I did wonder. Then Jim and Mary’s boy, that was the worst of course. Mark died just a few years later and his wife. I do sometimes think it was coincidence but-’

He trailed off once more. I wanted to move but I couldn’t. I shuffled in my seat instead.

‘Granddad, d’you want some water or anything?’

‘Nothing happened to me though. Nor your grandmother. Or your mother. Unless you count this now. But, no. I don’t think so. That’s just age. I don’t know why though. I took her out on that boat and dropped her in as much as the others. No reason to spare me but there you go. Maybe just coincidences but we did what we did for our families.’

His hands released the chair. He settled them back in his lap and let out a long, long sigh. I watched as his eyes began to flutter a little.

‘Granddad?’

‘You should get going Chris.’

‘Are you alright?’

He turned, his eyes bright and open, the usual cheeky smile plastered across his face.

‘You need to get going if you’re going to pick your girlfriend up on time.’

I checked my watch once more.

‘Are you sure you don’t want anything?’

‘I’ve already had my dinner.’

‘Another tea or anything?’

‘No, no, I’ll get myself some biscuits in a while.’

‘Alright, granddad, if you’re sure.’

‘Yes, my boy.’

\*

I was a little late picking Beth up. She smiled as I pulled the car up and kissed me as she climbed in.

‘You OK?’ she asked.

‘Yeah, just my granddad.’

‘You went to see him?’

‘Yeah, just now.’

‘Bad day?’

‘No, well, he seemed pretty good when I arrived but he got worse as I was there.’

‘Oh dear. I’m sorry,’ Beth said.

She kissed me again on the cheek and I smiled. We drove across the town, still quiet before the half five rush.

‘You’re very good to see him like you do.’

‘I don’t mind. When he’s alright he tells some funny stories.’

‘But he was bad today, at the end?’

I sighed and shook my head.

‘I don’t know. He just told this bizarre, horrible story. The other day he was ranting about the Soviet Union. He just gets confused I think.’

‘It’s got to be upsetting. It’s not fair, dementia. There’s no justice in the world.’

‘It’s difficult seeing him so different depending on the day,’ I said.

‘Why was the story horrible?’

‘It was just he said that back in the fifties or something there’d been some fish stock crisis where all the fish had disappeared. Then he said it was something to do with some witch apparently, that had cursed the seas and that he and some others had drowned her or something to cancel the curse.’

‘Oh God,’ Beth said.

‘I know.’

‘He doesn’t mean it. It’s just stuff all mixed up in his brain. He can’t help it,’ she said.

‘I know, I know. It’s probably something on TV and everything, it’s just when he says it to you like it’s real it’s, I don’t know, it’s just kind of scary.’

Beth nodded and took my hand for a moment as I changed gears.

‘It’s difficult with grandparents. You always imagine them like they were when you’re a kid, looking after you.’

I nodded and sneaked a quick glance at Beth, half framed against the window.

‘I only knew one of my grannies,’ she said, ‘my poor mum, she had to grow up fast.’

‘I’m sorry, I never knew.’

‘Well you don’t miss something you’ve never had I guess.’

We pulled into towards the estate where Beth lived.

‘I’ll have to meet your gran at some point.’

‘You still need to come over and meet my mum.’

‘I will.’

‘You’ve been busy with your granddad.’

I pulled the car up outside Beth’s house. She turned, smiled and fiddled with a strand of my hair.

‘I could come in and say hello to your mum now if you want.’

Beth shook her head, ‘Not now. You’re busy with your granddad.’

‘You sure?’

‘My other grandmother, the dead one, she died young, kind of a family tragedy. She drowned. It was pretty terrible apparently. My mother was very, very young when it happened but she knew.’

Beth let go of my hair and leaned forward towards me. Her face stopped, just before mine. I looked at her, ready to kiss, but something stopped me. Her eyes were locked, straight at my own, unblinking.

‘You might have heard of my grandmother Chris. Her name was Anne Lockwood.’

I tried to pull my face away but I couldn’t. Beth stared back at me and slowly let the smile build and creep across her face.

‘I’ll see you soon,’ she whispered.

My body fell back into the seat as Beth stepped out of the car. I caught my breath as she skipped up to her front door. My hand reached for the handbrake before she turned to look back. She smiled again as I drove the car away, my hand shaking against the wheel. A week later my grandfather was dead. But I’m not sure the reparations have been paid yet.",t2_4x4qc5je,False,,0,False,"Whatever The Sea Takes, It Always Gives Back",[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgwqc0,False,dark,,public,18,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,18,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583960248.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was dying. It hadn’t come as any great shock. A year prior he’d got the diagnosis the family were dreading-dementia. My great uncle had had it too and my grandmother, both dead. Within the year the physical effects were starting to take their toll. His memory was slipping more often. He was still at home but a nurse came every day. At least twice a week I’d pop in after work to see him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days it was good. He was the grandfather I remembered. Witty and charming, a genuine twinkle in his eyes and a bit cheeky to anyone and everyone. He’d tell me stories like he used to about his days as a fisherman in the bay and the weird assortment of friends he’d collected over the years. Other days were bad. On the best of the bad he’d sit silently, maybe mumbling to himself. On the worst he’d rant about how poorly he thought Harold Wilson was doing as Prime Minister, even though the man had been dead for twenty five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week before he died I left work early and drove over to to the little cul-de-sac he lived in. The nurse was just leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Hello.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Hello, you going in to see him?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yeah.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘He’s on pretty good form today.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘OK,’ I said, ‘good good.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nurse left and I ventured inside. He was laid back in his usual chair, looking out through the large living room bay window. Beyond the hills outside was the usual strip of blue, a glimpse of the sea blending into sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Hello granddad,’ I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Hello Chris,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went over, hugged him hello then headed to the kitchen, newly spotless after the nurse’s visit, to make tea. He took his cup with shaky hands and took a sip immediately with a satisfied sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You make a good cup.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Thanks granddad.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘How was work?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shrugged, ‘Usual stuff I guess. Nothing too exciting.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘A job’s a job.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Exactly.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sat up in his chair and sighed as his bones creaked with the strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘And how’s that girlfriend of yours?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled as he chuckled to himself. My suspicions, never confirmed, were that my grandfather had been a bit of a ladies man in his day, at least before meeting my grandmother. Although he hadn’t met Beth yet the fact I’d finally found someone I clearly liked brought him some quiet sense of pleasure, at least when he could remember who Beth was. They’d never met but I thought he’d have liked her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘She’s good. I’m picking her up in an hour.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Don’t let me keep you here,’ my grandfather said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘No, no. Plenty of time.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You’ve got to live life whilst you can. It’ll go quick.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Sounds like a cliché because it is but that doesn’t mean it’s not true,’ he muttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather looked out the window and took another gulp of his tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Things’ll happen in your life that’ll be on your mind forever. But if you have a good girl like-’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He waved his arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Beth?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yes,’ he said, ‘like Beth, if you have someone like Beth with you you’ll be happy. Where’d you meet her again?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Just walking along by the beach.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Walking?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yeah. She just started talking to me.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘She talked to you?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded. I’d told him the story a few times but he couldn’t seem to pin down the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well,’ he said, ‘very forward. But that’s what they’re like these days. It sounds better.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather chuckled again, then stopped. I followed his eyes to the television sat directly in front of him. It was off. Only his reflection bounced back. His head jerked round to look at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Your job pay well?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shrugged, ‘It’s a start really, it pays OK.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His head jerked back. I watched as his left hand found his right and began to pick at a loose strand of dead skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Beth’s job actually pays better,’ I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You’ve got to be able to look after her and yourself.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said nothing but nodded again and took a sip of tea. My grandfather gulped down the remnants of his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Did your parents talk to you about the fish drought in 1959?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘No.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It was bad that year. But you’ve got to provide for people. It was before your mother was born of course. She might not remember though I’m sure we must have mentioned it.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His hand twisted the skin back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘All the fish started drying up. The stocks.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Oh right. Like now? Declining?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘No. They all went. Very quick. We weren’t that big back then. It was a proper village, not like now. Only a few thousand I suppose,’ my grandfather said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat forward to listen to another tale from the sea. Many of them were funny but my grandfather’s eyes seemed dull. He was somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘We’d been married, your grandmother and me, but your mother was a year off or so. I’d been fishing for, oh, five years proper by then, but longer really. I was working on Jim Grant’s boat. We noticed within a week. Less and less of a catch.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Right.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It took us about a week and a bit till we realised everyone was the same. Nobody was having luck. Markets were practically empty in the mornings. A few people from the London restaurants were coming down to buy up everything we had before any locals could.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took another sip, ‘What was causing it?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well,’ my grandfather began before a long sigh, ‘we looked in the papers and listened to the radio but there was nothing. We thought something had spilled but no. We were getting desperate by then, having to go further and further out. Jim and me and the rest of the lads went out for four days at one point and we caught basically nothing. No one else seemed to have problems.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Four days? Wow.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘That’s nothing nowadays but back then you’d venture out for a day at most really. People were getting hungry. Your grandmother was hungry. Some people came from the council to test the waters but they were fine.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put my empty cup down and inched forward in the chair. He’d started to trail off again but snapped back to look at me, his hands still working the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Anyway, the lads pulled together, which was something but we were panicking, I don’t mind telling you Chris. Jim’s wife Mary worked out who was behind it. Anne Lockwood.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frowned and resisted a raised eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘She’d got herself involved with a fellow named Harry Woodley who worked on a boat. I didn’t know him very well. But, you-well, he was one of us. And Harry Woodley had enough of Anne Lockwood one day and got rid of her.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘They broke up you mean?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather nodded, ‘Yeah. He’d two timed her possibly, I’m not sure. But Anne Lockwood was a witch.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I winced and my grandfather switched his hands. He began to crack his knuckles, or attempt to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You shouldn’t say that about people granddad.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Not a bitch, a witch.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘A witch?’ I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yes.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed, as silently as I could, and rolled my eyes privately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘People knew about her doing that sort of thing. Her mother and grandmother had been the same. I didn’t know her personally, possibly your grandmother did but not well, mind, but she was a witch, everyone knew. But it was all nonsense stuff. Curing colds and warts and things.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed again but my grandfather was back in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘But this was different. Harry Woodley had broken her heart I suppose but she decided to take it out on all of us, instead of just him. I’m sure she meant it just for us, I mean fishermen, but then she must have realised we fed the whole place. If we starved everyone did.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I’m sorry granddad-’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘She poisoned the seas, you see? She cursed it. The fish or the sea or both. We weren’t sure exactly. She was into something darker than we thought. She was angry enough to hurt us all.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hid my face as best I could as he went on, still fiddling with his knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘We realised it was her. Everyone worked it out because she went round telling them. Harry Woodley knew straight away but we didn’t believe him, course, but when she went round telling everyone in the pub she’d cursed our fish, cursed the whole stock, just laughing about it. That’s hard to ignore. We begged her to stop.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched his hands. He strapped each one to the sides of his chair and stared back at the television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘We tried to tell her. We did. Properly time and again but she wouldn’t listen. She must have been hungry herself but I don’t know, when you can do that to the sea I’m sure money doesn’t matter. We told her time and again you’ve got to stop. We need the fish, our wives need the fish, our mothers as well. But she wouldn’t listen. Jim’s Mary was pregnant at the time and she was really worried.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘D’you want another cup of tea granddad?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘We had to do what we did. I don’t feel good about it but that’s what was. We took her out, me and Jim Grant, and Terry and Mark and some others. We sailed right out, halfway to France really. She told us we’d suffer for it, or if we didn’t our loved ones would. Said there’d be rep, uh, repar, you know, reparations to pay. But by then, considering how difficult it was at home Chris, we had to try. She weighed down easily. We expected something but she just floated down like any other person.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to catch my grandfather’s face but it was practically sunken it was so far away. His arms shook as they clung onto the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘When we got back, day later, the fish were already back. Another week and the stocks were normal again. Course, we should have believed Anne Lockwood about paying for it. Nothing happened first but when Terry had his accident, I did wonder. Then Jim and Mary’s boy, that was the worst of course. Mark died just a few years later and his wife. I do sometimes think it was coincidence but-’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He trailed off once more. I wanted to move but I couldn’t. I shuffled in my seat instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Granddad, d’you want some water or anything?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Nothing happened to me though. Nor your grandmother. Or your mother. Unless you count this now. But, no. I don’t think so. That’s just age. I don’t know why though. I took her out on that boat and dropped her in as much as the others. No reason to spare me but there you go. Maybe just coincidences but we did what we did for our families.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His hands released the chair. He settled them back in his lap and let out a long, long sigh. I watched as his eyes began to flutter a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Granddad?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You should get going Chris.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Are you alright?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned, his eyes bright and open, the usual cheeky smile plastered across his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You need to get going if you’re going to pick your girlfriend up on time.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked my watch once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Are you sure you don’t want anything?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I’ve already had my dinner.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Another tea or anything?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘No, no, I’ll get myself some biscuits in a while.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Alright, granddad, if you’re sure.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, my boy.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little late picking Beth up. She smiled as I pulled the car up and kissed me as she climbed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You OK?’ she asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yeah, just my granddad.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You went to see him?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yeah, just now.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Bad day?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘No, well, he seemed pretty good when I arrived but he got worse as I was there.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Oh dear. I’m sorry,’ Beth said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She kissed me again on the cheek and I smiled. We drove across the town, still quiet before the half five rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You’re very good to see him like you do.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I don’t mind. When he’s alright he tells some funny stories.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘But he was bad today, at the end?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed and shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I don’t know. He just told this bizarre, horrible story. The other day he was ranting about the Soviet Union. He just gets confused I think.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It’s got to be upsetting. It’s not fair, dementia. There’s no justice in the world.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It’s difficult seeing him so different depending on the day,’ I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Why was the story horrible?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It was just he said that back in the fifties or something there’d been some fish stock crisis where all the fish had disappeared. Then he said it was something to do with some witch apparently, that had cursed the seas and that he and some others had drowned her or something to cancel the curse.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Oh God,’ Beth said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I know.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘He doesn’t mean it. It’s just stuff all mixed up in his brain. He can’t help it,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I know, I know. It’s probably something on TV and everything, it’s just when he says it to you like it’s real it’s, I don’t know, it’s just kind of scary.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beth nodded and took my hand for a moment as I changed gears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It’s difficult with grandparents. You always imagine them like they were when you’re a kid, looking after you.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded and sneaked a quick glance at Beth, half framed against the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I only knew one of my grannies,’ she said, ‘my poor mum, she had to grow up fast.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I’m sorry, I never knew.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well you don’t miss something you’ve never had I guess.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled into towards the estate where Beth lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I’ll have to meet your gran at some point.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You still need to come over and meet my mum.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I will.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You’ve been busy with your granddad.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled the car up outside Beth’s house. She turned, smiled and fiddled with a strand of my hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I could come in and say hello to your mum now if you want.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beth shook her head, ‘Not now. You’re busy with your granddad.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You sure?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘My other grandmother, the dead one, she died young, kind of a family tragedy. She drowned. It was pretty terrible apparently. My mother was very, very young when it happened but she knew.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beth let go of my hair and leaned forward towards me. Her face stopped, just before mine. I looked at her, ready to kiss, but something stopped me. Her eyes were locked, straight at my own, unblinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You might have heard of my grandmother Chris. Her name was Anne Lockwood.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to pull my face away but I couldn’t. Beth stared back at me and slowly let the smile build and creep across her face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I’ll see you soon,’ she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body fell back into the seat as Beth stepped out of the car. I caught my breath as she skipped up to her front door. My hand reached for the handbrake before she turned to look back. She smiled again as I drove the car away, my hand shaking against the wheel. A week later my grandfather was dead. But I’m not sure the reparations have been paid yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Octavia was fun to be around. Oh, you had to be extremely careful, but as long as you paid very close attention to what was going on and you were careful not to insult her delicate sense of right and wrong, she could be a riot. She was most definitely not your typical demon. I mean, stop and think about it…how many demons have a genuine sense of humor? Seriously, have you ever met a demon who would actually ask you to pull their finger and then fall down laughing immediately after they shot an eight-foot sulfuric flame out their ass? But that’s Octavia.

She’d sit at that bar in Danny’s and get blitzed, regularly trying to tempt some poor sucker to take her to bed. Once in a while some newbie, totally unaware of who and what she was (and we all knew way better than to clue them in), would think he’d just fallen into the luckiest night of his life and take her up on her offer. After all, it’s not like Octavia is hideous or anything. Quite the opposite. She’s stunning. Flat, fucking stunning. And no horns or red skin or forked tail…nah, none of that stupid crap. If you weren’t aware of what she was you’d just never know.

She’d shown up one night about a year ago. Opened the door to Danny’s and strutted in wearing platforms, a skin-tight micro-mini skirt and a low-cut top that generously displayed her abundant goodies. Dark hair fell in waves across her shoulders and cascaded down her back. Every guy in the place started drooling. It was a dude named Oscar that moved in on her. Bought her a drink and started chatting her up. Her hand played across his thigh and I know damn good and well that his pulse rate was through the roof.

After an hour of playing with Oscar like that, she called Danny, the owner/bartender over and asked, “Says on the sign outside you got rooms? So, do you?” Danny nodded, they agreed on a price, and off she and Oscar went up the back steps. Every last man in the place was cursing Danny for his good luck. Or so we thought.

No one ever saw Oscar again. Danny said that the next morning she came back downstairs and apologized for some scorch marks on the sheets and paid Danny for the damages.

Same thing happened about a week later. It was a Friday night and I was shooting some pool with Bobby Batchelor. We’d both had a few and the game was, not surprisingly, taking a bit longer than usual when Octavia waltzed through the door again looking just as scrumptious as she had the week before. Bobby saw her first and tossed his cue on the green felt of the pool table, mumbled, “Sorry, man, but something important just came up,” then moved in her direction with a big grin on his face. Long story short, no one has ever seen Bobby again. And Danny got another payment for scorched sheets.

The next Friday it was Daryl Kavanaugh. He’d been out of town and it was his first time back in the bar. When Octavia started playing with his crotch, several of us tried to distract him long enough to whisper a warning. You can guess how that went.

The following Friday when Octavia showed up, everyone took note of her entrance, but nobody moved. We all just went back to our drinks or pool game or whatever we’d been doing. She made her way to the bar, then turned and leaned her gorgeous backside against it and called out.

“OK, boys, time for me to clue you all in on how this is going to work from this point on. Belly up to the bar and order what you want, on me.”

As soon as she finished talking, to a man, we all turned away, which I now realize was a bad move, something we quickly discovered.

Octavia took one step away from the bar and opened her mouth. No sound came out. She just stood there staring at us all with her mouth open as wide as she could get it. And then a bug flew out. That’s right, a bug. Big goddamn thing, too. And then another one. And another. And then five or six together. And then twenty. And then a whole fucking cloud of these massive bugs the likes of which you have never seen, and trust me, you never want to see. Thousands of those things pouring out of her open mouth, buzzing and whining and screeching. More and more and more until Octavia finally closed her mouth. She just stood there as that massive cloud of insects filled every square inch of that place. All you could do was swat at them, but that was totally useless.

They crawled all over you, slammed into your head, your face, your whole body. They skittered through your hair, tried to slither into your ears, found their way into your clothes. It was maddening.

They continued like that for what seemed like forever but was probably no more than two or three minutes until Octavia called, “Enough!” and opened her mouth again, and you guessed it, those zillions of bugs flew right back into her mouth. Every last one. Well…almost. There was one that was crawling all over her face but refused to go into her mouth.

“Xendor!” she finally yelled. “You really want me to make an example of you? If not, then get your crusty little carcass back where it belongs. NOW!!!” She opened her mouth and that last bug scurried into her oral cavity without another second’s hesitation.

She ran her tongue across her lips, then said, “Well, gentlemen, now that I hopefully have your attention, permit me to renew my invitation. Belly up to the bar and order whatever you please. I’m buying.”

Every man bolted to the bar and began placing orders which Danny was moving at top speed to fill. Once we’d all been served, Octavia managed to hoist her delicious posterior onto the bar, crossed those magnificent legs, and looked over the sea of faces with a lascivious grin on her lips. Every eye was fastened on her. I mean, face it…it sure as hell isn’t every day you witness what all of us just had. And we all figured that paying attention was in our best interest.

“OK, boys,” she said, “it’s like this. I’m a demon.” She paused for effect, smiling as we all looked at each other, brows furrowed, not sure we were hearing quite right, then, “Yup, straight out of the pits of you-know-where. Servant of the most evil one himself. And for the foreseeable future, I have decided to make this lovely little watering hole my place of business. I love a good bar, and this one just suits me to a “T”. Great atmosphere. Decent prices. And you guys are all cute as can be. Anyway, my game works like this; I find some nice, unsuspecting soul whose heart is open to a little cheating. They’re all married, by the way. Single ones I’m not interested in. Nor do I give a rat’s ass about the ones who are faithful to their wives.” I remembered then that Oscar and Bobby and Daryl had all, in fact, been married. I don’t think anyone had connected those particular dots up to that point.

“So,” she continued, “my job is to play a rather severe version of karma, evening up the score with these philandering slugs. I give them one last night of bliss and then shuttle them off to their eternal ‘reward’. They all go with a smile on their face, but I rather suspect that when they wake up it’s a different story.

“But,” she added, “contrary to what you’ve heard over your lifetimes, the boss isn’t quite as heartless as you might think. See, the guilty ones we take, but the innocent wives and children don’t wind up suffering as a result. What the new widows soon discover is that, unbeknownst to them, their cheating husbands had all taken out a sizeable life insurance policy just before they disappeared. And our little company always pays off, handsomely. No questions asked. So far, all of the innocent widows have actually gone on to live their lives quite happily.”

“Anyway, back to the reason for our little chat. I’ve managed to rid your midst of the three cheating scumbags who used to patronize this charming little establishment, so I won’t be bothering any of you. However, I will still turn up from time to time. And my visits will all coincide with a brand new patron dropping in for the first time. Oddly enough, every one of those patrons will be married. Also oddly enough, they will be out…umm…how should I put this? ‘Catting around’? ‘Playing the field’? ‘Looking to score’? Anyway, you get my meaning. And every one of them will get lucky. Every last one.”

“Your job, boys, will simply be to keep your mouths shut. You know who I am. You know why I’m here. And you WILL keep it to yourselves. Doing otherwise would not, shall we say, be good for your health.”

“But your reward will be free drinks all night every time I show up. That, and some really fun times, both for you and my date of the evening. The only difference is that you will all go home to your families. Them? Well, at least they’ll all have one hell of a last ride.”

So, I’ve filled you in on Octavia and her little hobby. Yeah, she warned us all to keep our mouths shut, but I think I’m probably OK. First, Octavia isn’t her real name. Second, Danny’s is not the name of the bar. And third, if you’re a nice, faithful husband, you’ve got nothing to worry about.

Like I said, that was about a year ago. Octavia drops in on average two or three times a month. And good to her promise, it’s free drinks all evening and some roaringly great times. Of course, the guy she winds up with has a magnificent time, too. Right up to the point where those scorch marks wind up on Danny’s sheets again.",t2_3o6pv89b,False,,0,False,Who Knew Demons Could Be Party Animals?,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgth99,False,dark,,public,45,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,45,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583941118.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Octavia was fun to be around. Oh, you had to be extremely careful, but as long as you paid very close attention to what was going on and you were careful not to insult her delicate sense of right and wrong, she could be a riot. She was most definitely not your typical demon. I mean, stop and think about it…how many demons have a genuine sense of humor? Seriously, have you ever met a demon who would actually ask you to pull their finger and then fall down laughing immediately after they shot an eight-foot sulfuric flame out their ass? But that’s Octavia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’d sit at that bar in Danny’s and get blitzed, regularly trying to tempt some poor sucker to take her to bed. Once in a while some newbie, totally unaware of who and what she was (and we all knew way better than to clue them in), would think he’d just fallen into the luckiest night of his life and take her up on her offer. After all, it’s not like Octavia is hideous or anything. Quite the opposite. She’s stunning. Flat, fucking stunning. And no horns or red skin or forked tail…nah, none of that stupid crap. If you weren’t aware of what she was you’d just never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’d shown up one night about a year ago. Opened the door to Danny’s and strutted in wearing platforms, a skin-tight micro-mini skirt and a low-cut top that generously displayed her abundant goodies. Dark hair fell in waves across her shoulders and cascaded down her back. Every guy in the place started drooling. It was a dude named Oscar that moved in on her. Bought her a drink and started chatting her up. Her hand played across his thigh and I know damn good and well that his pulse rate was through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour of playing with Oscar like that, she called Danny, the owner/bartender over and asked, “Says on the sign outside you got rooms? So, do you?” Danny nodded, they agreed on a price, and off she and Oscar went up the back steps. Every last man in the place was cursing Danny for his good luck. Or so we thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever saw Oscar again. Danny said that the next morning she came back downstairs and apologized for some scorch marks on the sheets and paid Danny for the damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same thing happened about a week later. It was a Friday night and I was shooting some pool with Bobby Batchelor. We’d both had a few and the game was, not surprisingly, taking a bit longer than usual when Octavia waltzed through the door again looking just as scrumptious as she had the week before. Bobby saw her first and tossed his cue on the green felt of the pool table, mumbled, “Sorry, man, but something important just came up,” then moved in her direction with a big grin on his face. Long story short, no one has ever seen Bobby again. And Danny got another payment for scorched sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next Friday it was Daryl Kavanaugh. He’d been out of town and it was his first time back in the bar. When Octavia started playing with his crotch, several of us tried to distract him long enough to whisper a warning. You can guess how that went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Friday when Octavia showed up, everyone took note of her entrance, but nobody moved. We all just went back to our drinks or pool game or whatever we’d been doing. She made her way to the bar, then turned and leaned her gorgeous backside against it and called out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OK, boys, time for me to clue you all in on how this is going to work from this point on. Belly up to the bar and order what you want, on me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as she finished talking, to a man, we all turned away, which I now realize was a bad move, something we quickly discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Octavia took one step away from the bar and opened her mouth. No sound came out. She just stood there staring at us all with her mouth open as wide as she could get it. And then a bug flew out. That’s right, a bug. Big goddamn thing, too. And then another one. And another. And then five or six together. And then twenty. And then a whole fucking cloud of these massive bugs the likes of which you have never seen, and trust me, you never want to see. Thousands of those things pouring out of her open mouth, buzzing and whining and screeching. More and more and more until Octavia finally closed her mouth. She just stood there as that massive cloud of insects filled every square inch of that place. All you could do was swat at them, but that was totally useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They crawled all over you, slammed into your head, your face, your whole body. They skittered through your hair, tried to slither into your ears, found their way into your clothes. It was maddening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They continued like that for what seemed like forever but was probably no more than two or three minutes until Octavia called, “Enough!” and opened her mouth again, and you guessed it, those zillions of bugs flew right back into her mouth. Every last one. Well…almost. There was one that was crawling all over her face but refused to go into her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Xendor!” she finally yelled. “You really want me to make an example of you? If not, then get your crusty little carcass back where it belongs. NOW!!!” She opened her mouth and that last bug scurried into her oral cavity without another second’s hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ran her tongue across her lips, then said, “Well, gentlemen, now that I hopefully have your attention, permit me to renew my invitation. Belly up to the bar and order whatever you please. I’m buying.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every man bolted to the bar and began placing orders which Danny was moving at top speed to fill. Once we’d all been served, Octavia managed to hoist her delicious posterior onto the bar, crossed those magnificent legs, and looked over the sea of faces with a lascivious grin on her lips. Every eye was fastened on her. I mean, face it…it sure as hell isn’t every day you witness what all of us just had. And we all figured that paying attention was in our best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OK, boys,” she said, “it’s like this. I’m a demon.” She paused for effect, smiling as we all looked at each other, brows furrowed, not sure we were hearing quite right, then, “Yup, straight out of the pits of you-know-where. Servant of the most evil one himself. And for the foreseeable future, I have decided to make this lovely little watering hole my place of business. I love a good bar, and this one just suits me to a “T”. Great atmosphere. Decent prices. And you guys are all cute as can be. Anyway, my game works like this; I find some nice, unsuspecting soul whose heart is open to a little cheating. They’re all married, by the way. Single ones I’m not interested in. Nor do I give a rat’s ass about the ones who are faithful to their wives.” I remembered then that Oscar and Bobby and Daryl had all, in fact, been married. I don’t think anyone had connected those particular dots up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So,” she continued, “my job is to play a rather severe version of karma, evening up the score with these philandering slugs. I give them one last night of bliss and then shuttle them off to their eternal ‘reward’. They all go with a smile on their face, but I rather suspect that when they wake up it’s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But,” she added, “contrary to what you’ve heard over your lifetimes, the boss isn’t quite as heartless as you might think. See, the guilty ones we take, but the innocent wives and children don’t wind up suffering as a result. What the new widows soon discover is that, unbeknownst to them, their cheating husbands had all taken out a sizeable life insurance policy just before they disappeared. And our little company always pays off, handsomely. No questions asked. So far, all of the innocent widows have actually gone on to live their lives quite happily.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anyway, back to the reason for our little chat. I’ve managed to rid your midst of the three cheating scumbags who used to patronize this charming little establishment, so I won’t be bothering any of you. However, I will still turn up from time to time. And my visits will all coincide with a brand new patron dropping in for the first time. Oddly enough, every one of those patrons will be married. Also oddly enough, they will be out…umm…how should I put this? ‘Catting around’? ‘Playing the field’? ‘Looking to score’? Anyway, you get my meaning. And every one of them will get lucky. Every last one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your job, boys, will simply be to keep your mouths shut. You know who I am. You know why I’m here. And you WILL keep it to yourselves. Doing otherwise would not, shall we say, be good for your health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But your reward will be free drinks all night every time I show up. That, and some really fun times, both for you and my date of the evening. The only difference is that you will all go home to your families. Them? Well, at least they’ll all have one hell of a last ride.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve filled you in on Octavia and her little hobby. Yeah, she warned us all to keep our mouths shut, but I think I’m probably OK. First, Octavia isn’t her real name.

,nosleep,"I don’t know how much longer I have, and I need to get this message out there so others do not make the same mistake that we did. My two friends who went with me were both found dead this morning. I’ve been seeing her for a week, she’s not here right now, but I know she’ll be back tonight.   
  It all started a month ago when we went into that God damned house. We all grew up being told that that house was forsaken, touched by some kind of evil. I guess we are just dumb kids because one month ago today we decided that we would finally go to the old Combes mansion. What in God’s name would compel a group of three nineteen-year-old guys to do this? I don’t know...call it skepticism, or maybe a macabre curiosity.   
  You see, we never really believed the stories that we heard about the house that we all heard while growing up. You know, the stories of abuse and rituals that allegedly went on in that place. But we had to see it for ourselves, just to prove that it wasn’t true.   
  I wish now, more than anything, that we hadn’t.   
  A month ago, on a clammy, overcast night I sat around a bonfire in the backyard of my parent’s house with my two childhood best friends, Alex and Phil. We were enjoying a few beers and telling college stories since we all went to different campuses, but we were all home for Spring break. It seemed like the thing to do. Alex was telling a story about a fling that he had had before coming home for Spring break. He said he broke it off because she was into some kind of “witch shit”.   
  Phil and I laughed at this absurd story that he was telling.   
“A witch? Yeah right man” Phil said.   
  Alex responded by saying that she was crazy. Allegedly she had sacrificed a dog before.   
   “We all know that witchcraft shit is a hoax, scary stories that our parents told us to make us behave when we were fucking five.”   
  Alex quiffed back by saying “That’s bullshit man, do you remember the old combes house? The one that we were always told to stay away from as kids?”.    
  Phil replied “What? The witch's house?” while laughing obnoxiously.   
  I could sense the agitation between my friends at this point, so I said: “Well if it will shut you two up, why don’t we go check out the house?”   
  Phil replies immediately with “Dude, hell yeah!” and pulled out his keys.   
  At this point Alex looked concerned, all color draining from his face. He weakly said, “You know guys, it’s getting late, I think I'm going to go home.”   
  “Fucking Pussy!” Phil exclaimed loudly “We all know witches don’t fucking exist, why are you being such a bitch?”   
  I rolled my eyes, Phil is always such a clown. “Fuck you, man” Alex exclaimed, in an annoyed voice. “I’ll go to the stupid house”.  
  After a few minutes, we all piled into Phil’s car, throwing a twelve-pack in the back seat for good measure. We drove for what seemed like an eternity, even though it was only about a twenty-minute drive. The old Combes’ house was only thirteen miles from town. As we drove and got out of town it began to get quiet. Quieter the closer we got to the house.   
  Finally, we get to the house and begin driving up the long, crumbling cobblestone driveway. This driveway seems to go on for a mile, but maybe that was just because we had to go two miles per hour to not blow out a tire. The driveway was shrouded in trees, half-dead from the Winter that had just ended.   
  Then we saw it, the house. The depressing looking stone and log structure stands two stories tall. Most of the windows had been broken, and half of the roof was caved in on account of the large tree sitting on the roof.  
   “Dude...let’s..uh.. turn around,” Alex said in a nervous tone, his voice cracking slightly.                                         
   I was silently thinking the same thing when Phil lets out a cry of “That driveway was forever fucking long, and I almost lost a tire about four times, I’m seeing the damn witch!”  
  I told Phil “Eleanor Combes has been dead for almost one hundred years, dumbass. Don’t you remember any of the stories that our parents told us?”   
  Phil responds “They say she still haunts this place, I’m going to see me a witch, bitch.”  
  We finally park the car and begin to walk up to the house. It's pitch black and we can hear gravel crunching under our feet when Phil lets out a shrill sounding yell “Ow! Fuck! I twisted my ankle!”   
  I turn to look at him and see that he’s fine and tell him “You’re being a baby. Come on, let’s get this over with.”  
  As we approach the front door, which is caved in almost completely, I get a chill down my spine. But, like any self-respecting college-aged guy, I ignore this feeling, not wanting to be called a bitch by Phil yet again.  
  We had to climb through the caved-in door and when we got in we were immediately faced with a shroud of blackness.  
   “I can’t see shit!” Alex said.   
  “Hold on, I have a flashlight on my phone,” I said as I pulled out my phone and turned on my light.   
  The others all did the same  
  “Holy shit, how long has this place been abandoned?” Phil said as he moved his light across the room, illuminating a dusty, moldy, living room that is littered with broken furniture.   
  “Uh... I don’t know, maybe seventy-five years?” I said, despite being completely clueless. We kept looking around the room and the surrounding hallways, it was just a dusty old house, no pentagrams, dead goats or sacrificed insight.   
  Phil was rummaging through a cabinet and Alex was looking at some of the old-timey portraits on the wall.   
  “Yo guys, check this out!” Phil says while holding up a small doll that he found in a cabinet.  
   I knew something was wrong with this doll as soon as I saw it. It was stained brown, almost like blood had dried on it.   
  “Uh…is that real hair…?” I asked sheepishly   
  “I don’t know...” Phil replied, sounding almost as nervous as I am at this point. There was a single, long needle going through the doll’s head.  
  Something was wrong, with this place, very wrong.   
  “What the fuck is that?” Alex said nervously while pointing at an old family photo containing who must have been the Combes   
  “Those are the witches!” Phil declared obnoxiously.  
   “No, I mean, why is the little girl scratched out of the picture?” Alex said,  a nervous tone permeating his voice.   
  “Uh…I’m not sure, I didn’t think the Combes had a daughter,” I said as a chill went down my spine at that moment.  
  “Hey guys, I think we should go now, we saw that house, it’s just an old house. No witches” I said.   
  “Yeah, maybe you’re right,” Phil said.   
  Phil reached in his pocket to get his keys so we could leave “We have a problem, where the hell are my keys”? He asked while sounding tense.  
“You probably dropped them while you were rummaging around in that stupid cabinet,” I said.   
  Phil bent down and began looking around on the floor, his flashlight illuminating the damp, moldy floorboards.   
  “What is that?” Alex asked as Phil’s light floated over a handle on the floor underneath the cabinet.   
  “It looks like a trap door,” Phil said.   
  Then, out of nowhere, a sickening feeling of dread, mixed with an insatiable curiosity hit me, as if there was some kind of terrible secret I just had to know, hidden underneath that door.   
  “I’m going down there. Help me move this cabinet guys” I said.   
  “No chance in hell!” Alex exclaimed in sheer panic at this point  
  I get angry at this point. For no rational reason. God, we should have just left, but I remember saying “Alex, you’d better fucking help me, or else!”  
  Phill stood there quietly, looking very nervous, until finally he chimed in “Alright man, just calm down, we’ll help you…”  
  I hear Alex exclaim under his breath “What the hell is the matter with you man”?  
  I didn’t know, something had just come over me. A horrible feeling, rage, disgust. I finally muster up the courage and reply “I don’t know man, there’s something wrong with this place, and I think we’ll find out if we move this drawer.”   
 We moved the dresser, and what we found, dear God, I wish we hadn’t. Upon opening the trap door that is hidden underneath the floor we found… human remains. Partially skeletal and partially preserved.   
  “Oh my god. We need to call the fucking cops, now!” Alex exclaimed  
  “What the fuck…. that ‘s a fucking corpse!” Phil screamed  
  I panicked, overcome by a sense that something truly horrible had happened here. I illuminate the body with my flashlight, it looked to be a girl, a small girl, maybe five foot tall, wearing a gray, tattered gown. With the same brownish bloodstains that were on the doll. It looked just like the doll Phil had found earlier.  
  “What is that?” Alex said in a terrified voice while motioning to a small, leather-bound book next to the body  
  “I… I don’t know,” I said  
  Phil proclaimed again “We need to call the goddamn cops! I swear to god!”  
  It was at that moment I knew, we had to read that book. “Hold on, we need to read the book…”  
  They all have a look of sheer panic, but for some ungodly reason that I don’t know, we didn’t run then. We didn’t run while we could have. I opened the book and began to read aloud “To my dearest daughter, I’m so sorry. But you had to be kept away from the world”  
  I felt my heart sink. This was a diary, the diary of Eleanor Combes. The stories had been true. At least partially.  
  “Eleanor wasn’t the witch… She was” I said, gesturing towards the skeletal remains we had just unearthed.   
  “No way. This is fake as fuck. This was murder!” Phil exclaimed  
  “Hold on,” I said, as I continue to read, the diary outlines how after Susan, the name of the girl who’s body we unearthed, the entire family died, one by one, with Angus Combes dying of a gunshot wound to the dead while hunting, and Samuel Combes, the son, died during WWI.   
  “The needle… through the doll’s head…” Phil’s voice cracked, “No way, man!”  
  I continued to read. Eleanor went mad in her grief.  She locked her daughter in her room for years until finally, she made a tree fall on the house when she caused a terrible storm. Following this Eleanor did the unthinkable, she let her daughter starve to death, in her own home, and buried the body under the floorboards. But according to the diary, it took a long time for Susan to die, because she had eaten her fingers.  
  “The tree…” Alex muttered looking up towards the ceiling which had a massive hole in it with the limbs of a large, dead willow dangling through it.  
  I looked down at the corpse, knowing exactly what I would see. It had just one finger.  
  I finished reading, out of an obligation to tell this poor girl's story at this point, but also out of an abhorrent sense of dread.  
It concluded with this... “To whom finds this diary, that means that you have found her. May God save your soul.”   
  We left shortly afterward and called the police once we got back into town. We were all in shock of what we saw and after giving statements and being told that we would be facing trespassing charges, we vowed to never speak of this again, to anyone.  
  I had hoped, we had all hoped, that we would be able to forget about what we had seen. Alas, no.   
  That night after we had all returned home, I struggled to find any sleep, but when sleep finally came, it was interrupted. I heard a nauseating sound, a crunching, vile sound, coming from the corner of my bedroom. I could see the outline of a figure standing there, curled in the fetal position. I pick up my phone and use the flashlight to see better, it’s gone, and the sound stopped.   
  “God, what had we found,” I thought to myself before falling back into a feverish sleep.   
  The next day I talked to Phil and Alex. They were exhausted. They had experienced the same disturbing apparition.   
  “It must have been a dream,” Alex said in a shaky, nervous tone  
  “Yeah right, you heard what the diary said. We’re cursed.” Phil said in a panicked voice  
  I hoped it was just a dream, but I knew it wasn’t. I knew that whatever we uncovered was now haunting us.  
  For a few weeks, we continued to have the same vision at night. We continued to talk about it every day, despite saying that we would try to forget about it. We couldn’t. She had latched onto us.  
  One night, about two weeks after the first apparition, it got worse. As I slept the same uneasy sleep that had been so common for me I saw the same silhouette again, except this time it was standing. And it was closer to the end of my bed. I heard the same disgusting sound, almost as if…   
  “No...God no” I said to thought  
  I picked up my phone off the nightstand and used it to illuminate this figure in front of me, and I wish I hadn’t. There she was, in her tattered clothes, the gray, rotten flesh peeling off her bones. She looked down at the floor, her long black hair partially obstructing her face.   
  I threw up all over my sheets at what I saw next. She was gnawing through her fingers and swallowing them. Thick, black blood dripping onto my floor and filling up her rotten mouth. I screamed, petrified of the horror that was sitting in front of me.  
  “What the hell is going on?!” My mother screamed as she barged through my door and turned the lights on. The apparition vanished.   
  “What happened? Are you sick?” My mom said in a panicked voice upon seeing my vomit on the floor.   
  “Uh… Nothing mom, I must have had some kind of fever dream and then threw up.”  
  Upon hearing this my mom calmed down and finally left. I cleaned up my vomit, but I wasn’t able to fall back asleep. I couldn't see her...that thing, again.   
  The next day I told my friends what had happened, the same thing had happened to them.   
  “What does she want? Like why is she here man?” Alex said in a shaky voice  
  “I don’t know. I wish I did.” I said  
  “There’s nothing we can do. She won’t leave us alone, she’s a fucking ghost!. We should have never gone to that damn house!” Phil said, following up with an apology “I’m so sorry, this was all my fault. I just wanted to see the witch house…”  
  “It’s okay…We all thought it was fake.” I replied, feeling crushed.   
  We were all unsure, and very afraid. What did she want? How would we make her stop?  
  A few nights passed, with nothing happening. Had whatever we disturbed turned it’s gaze away from us? I wish, but sadly, no.   
  Things only got worse from here.  
  I don’t remember how many days had passed, but I was once again awakened by the sound of gnashing flesh and crunching bone. The stench of something long dead assailed my nostrils.   
  I sat up immediately and looked around my room, but I didn’t have to look far. She was standing right next to my bed. Less than a foot from me.  
  I tried to scream, but no air escaped my lungs.   
  There I was, looking directly at her. Her matted, black hair no longer covers her face. I could see the coagulated blood on her face. Her eyes, or lack thereof, stared into my soul. I looked directly into her cavern-like eye sockets and was overcome by a sense of pure dread. This was something very evil, and it had set its sights on me.   
   It was standing a foot from me.   
  This encounter felt like an eternity but was had lasted only a few seconds. It ended when she lifted her mangled, rotting hand and pointed at me with the one finger she had left. Blood dripping all over me at this point.   
  I was frozen.  
  She opened her mouth, and let out a groan as if she was trying to scream but her vocal cords had decayed away.   
I knew that I was going to die at that moment, but then, she vanished.   
  The following day we all met again, we had to do something about this. We had to find out what was afflicting us. Alex’s’ parents' kitchen made a strange venue to discuss the entity that was haunting us.  
  “There is no way I am going back to that house!” Alex exclaimed  
  I explained to him that we had to and that we would be no worse off than we are now.   
  Phil was silent. A miracle considering we could rarely get him to shut up, but we could tell something was wrong.  
  “What did you see?” I asked, confused at his silence and lack of emotion.  
  “I don’t know what happened, but that thing, it crawled on top of me last night,” Phil said, his emotionless face contorting into one of repulsion and fear.  
  We looked at him, concerned that he was telling us, and before we could speak he followed up with a shaky voice “She’s evil. She wants us to suffer the same way that she did.”   
  Our conversation fell mute after that. Just abject silence, but I could tell that we agreed. We had to go back to the house.  
  It was settled. We returned to the house, hoping to find more clues as to why this was happening to us.  
  We agreed to meet back here at night because we could have to sneak back to the house. It was too risky going in broad daylight with it now being a crime scene.   
 I returned home and  I tried to go about my day, I researched witch-hunting and how to exorcise a ghost, but it was all clearly bullshit.  
  The entire day I could hear it. The sound of flesh and bone being gnawed on and the groan of decayed vocal cords, but I didn’t see her anywhere.   
  I decided to head out as it got darker, and I could smell the stench of rotting flesh coming from behind me, but there was nothing. Yet.   
  When I arrived at Alex’s’ house he was already ready to leave  
  “Dude, let’s just get this over with,” He said in a rushed, nervous tone.  
  “But… Where’s Phil?” I asked  
  “He should show up soon,” He said  
  We waited. Five minutes passed, and then thirty, and then an hour. We tried calling our friend probably a dozen times, but it went straight to voicemail.   
  “We need to go to Phils’ house,” I said  
  Alex agreed. We were hoping that he had just fallen asleep, but we knew something was wrong as we drove on the backroads that led to his house.  
  It was dark and clammy out, it had started to rain. As we drove we had to keep the brights off because we could see her, standing along the road, just pointing at us as we drove by.   
  We didn’t speak on that car ride. There was nothing to say, what was happening was impossible. Ghosts aren’t real, neither are witches, yet here we were, seeing the ghost of a witch.  
  Finally, after what felt like an eternity of driving we saw it.  
  My heart sunk.  
  Sitting in a ditch, crushed against a tree, was Phils’ beat-up car, the brights still on.   
  “Oh shit! We have to help him!” I exclaim loudly, as I slam on my brakes and stop the car.  
  We ran over to the car, Phil was in it, but he was gone. The steering wheel had punctured his chest cavity and his head was smashed into the windshield.  
  “What the fuck man?!” Alex said, screaming at this point “Our friend is fucking dead! All because we wanted to go into some fucking house!”  
  “We don’t know that. Maybe he just lost control…” I replied, knowing that I was just lying to myself.   
  But then it hit me. Phil’s hands were wrapped around the steering wheel. His fingerless hands. Well except for one, which was outstretched and pointing to a small clearing.  
  She was standing in the clearing, staring at Alex and me. She was illuminated by the headlights from Phil’s car, and I was terrified. This thing had killed our best friend.  
  She smiled a sickening, twisted grin, black blood flowing out from her mouth of rotten teeth.  
  We ran and got into my car and sped off, almost going off the road at several points.  Finally, when we had gotten far enough away we could call 911.   
  We found a spot to pull off and wait for the ambulance.    
  Finally, we saw the lights of the ambulance coming our way. Once they passed us we followed them to the crash.   
  When we arrived at the crash we horrified to find that Phils’ body was gone.   
  “Do you think that she… took him…?” Alex whispered, not wanting to be overheard by the paramedics.  
  I didn’t know. I had no idea what could have happened. Did Phil somehow survive the crash? No, that was impossible. He was dead, very dead.  
  “I.. I don’t know…” I said, trying to sound as collected as possible.  
  After being questioned by medics, the police arrived and asked us even more questions, we answered them to the best of our ability, but we had no real answers for them.   
  “We need to go to the house. This has gone far enough.” I told Alex  
  “Yeah, right. Let’s go,” he replied.   
  The drive was tense, nerve-racking. So much had happened in the past month.  
  “What are we going to do man? We’re fucked. She is going to kill us, just like she killed Phil!” Alex let out, yelling from my passenger seat.  
  “We don’t know if Phil is dead. Maybe he was able to walk away...” I replied, knowing that I was wrong. I was just trying to cling onto any semblance of reality.   
  “No one can walk away from that. Chest fucking chest was caved in!” Alex screamed, now sounding angry and frantic.  
  I didn’t say anything, I knew that he was right. This ghost, or witch, or whatever the hell that thing is, killed our friend. I just knew it.   
  We finally arrived at the house. The drive took what felt like an eternity. When we arrived the house was dimly lit, as if by candlelight.  
  “She’s waiting for us,” Alex said, staring at me with transfixed eyes  
  “What the fuck are you talking about? How do you know that?” I asked  
  “Why else would there be fucking lights on in that place?!” Alex yelled back at me  
  He was right. But we had to go inside, we needed answers. I mean, what hope did we have?   
  We sprint up the dilapidated cobblestone driveway, not caring if we fall or break our legs. We dove through the broken front door and were greeted immediately by the stench of decay. I look around the house, it’s lit dimly by candles, but it was what was in the center of the floor that made me lose it.  
  Laying in some kind of sigil on the floor, that was drawn in blood, was Phils’ body.   
  My heart sank. Standing directly above Phils’ corpse was the ghost. Groaning in a haunting, rhythmic manner, as if saying some kind of incantation.   
  “Fuck you, bitch!” Alex yelled as he lunged at her  
  He ended up stumbling over Phils’ body and passing directly through the apparition, but she was gone, at the very least.   
  “We need to get out of here! And we need to get his body out of here too. I’m not leaving him behind!” Alex said, still frantic after what had just happened.   
  “You’re right. Let’s go.” I said, as we grabbed Phil’s remains and carried him out the door.  
  Alex tried desperately to call the police after this, but it was no use. There was no signal.  
  “Fuck. Fuck!” Alex let out a cry, bursting into tears and falling to the ground.   
  I wanted to curl into a ball and let that thing take me at that moment. None of this could be real. This couldn’t be happening.   
  “You need to get up! We have to get out of here!” I told Alex  
  He finally got up, and we did the only thing that we could think of. We put Phil’s remains in the trunk and tried to leave.   
  But the car wouldn’t turn over. Had I left the lights on? No, we were only in there for a few minutes.  
  Then, in my rearview mirror, I saw her. Sitting in the back seat, reaching up to grab Alex, who is sitting next to me. I cranked the car one more time and stomped on the gas, the motor roared to life as we barreled into the house.   
  When I came to everything was on fire. Alex was on the floor of the burning building, around 10 feet from met, next to him was my car, completely engulfed in flames.   
  I couldn't feel my legs, I tried to drag myself over to him, and as I did that thing crawled on top of him. He was thrashing and screaming but it was as though she weighed a ton, he just couldn’t move.  
  She took her one, rotten, twisted finger and put it over his face, thick black blood was dripping all over his face. Next, she shoved the finger down his throat as he tried to scream. He flailed a twisted violently, letting out muffled screams as he was choked and suffocated on her tainted, vile blood.   
  Next, she let out that same hellacious groan I had come to know and extracted her hand from Alex’s’ mouth. He went limp instantly, as she pulled a black, hazy mist from his body. There was one last gasp as she pulled this… the soul, out of my friend. She proceeded to open her decayed mouth wide, her jaw seeming to unhinge, and devoured the black mist that came from Alex’s body. He was dead.  I knew it.   
  I let out a cry “God help me!” I screamed, as the building burned and the world went black. As I slipped into unconsciousness, she crawled towards me.  The last thing I remember was her gangly, rotten limbs crawling across the floor, her decaying mouth open wide, and her hand outstretched towards me.  
  I woke up four days later, in the hospital. I was badly burned, and I’m now paralyzed from the waist down. I guess part of the ceiling fell on me as the building burned. The firefighters aren’t sure how I survived and say that I am lucky to be alive.  
  But I’m not. I’m not lucky to be alive. She comes and goes, just standing in the corner, sometimes in broad daylight, even. She just stares at me, and smiles in the twisted, bloody grin, and points at me with her decayed, finger on her self mutilated hand. She groans, in that raspy tone I am all too familiar with. 

   I know she will eventually kill me too, just like my friends, but for now, she just smiles and points, relishing in my misery and helplessness.",t2_4fwc6653,False,,0,False,My Friends and I Discovered a Corpse... and now She won't Leave Us Alone,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fh2o7p,False,dark,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583983303.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much longer I have, and I need to get this message out there so others do not make the same mistake that we did. My two friends who went with me were both found dead this morning. I’ve been seeing her for a week, she’s not here right now, but I know she’ll be back tonight.&lt;br/&gt;
  It all started a month ago when we went into that God damned house. We all grew up being told that that house was forsaken, touched by some kind of evil. I guess we are just dumb kids because one month ago today we decided that we would finally go to the old Combes mansion. What in God’s name would compel a group of three nineteen-year-old guys to do this? I don’t know...call it skepticism, or maybe a macabre curiosity.&lt;br/&gt;
  You see, we never really believed the stories that we heard about the house that we all heard while growing up. You know, the stories of abuse and rituals that allegedly went on in that place. But we had to see it for ourselves, just to prove that it wasn’t true.&lt;br/&gt;
  I wish now, more than anything, that we hadn’t.&lt;br/&gt;
  A month ago, on a clammy, overcast night I sat around a bonfire in the backyard of my parent’s house with my two childhood best friends, Alex and Phil. We were enjoying a few beers and telling college stories since we all went to different campuses, but we were all home for Spring break. It seemed like the thing to do. Alex was telling a story about a fling that he had had before coming home for Spring break. He said he broke it off because she was into some kind of “witch shit”.&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil and I laughed at this absurd story that he was telling.&lt;br/&gt;
“A witch? Yeah right man” Phil said.&lt;br/&gt;
  Alex responded by saying that she was crazy. Allegedly she had sacrificed a dog before.&lt;br/&gt;
   “We all know that witchcraft shit is a hoax, scary stories that our parents told us to make us behave when we were fucking five.”&lt;br/&gt;
  Alex quiffed back by saying “That’s bullshit man, do you remember the old combes house? The one that we were always told to stay away from as kids?”.&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil replied “What? The witch&amp;#39;s house?” while laughing obnoxiously.&lt;br/&gt;
  I could sense the agitation between my friends at this point, so I said: “Well if it will shut you two up, why don’t we go check out the house?”&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil replies immediately with “Dude, hell yeah!” and pulled out his keys.&lt;br/&gt;
  At this point Alex looked concerned, all color draining from his face. He weakly said, “You know guys, it’s getting late, I think I&amp;#39;m going to go home.”&lt;br/&gt;
  “Fucking Pussy!” Phil exclaimed loudly “We all know witches don’t fucking exist, why are you being such a bitch?”&lt;br/&gt;
  I rolled my eyes, Phil is always such a clown. “Fuck you, man” Alex exclaimed, in an annoyed voice. “I’ll go to the stupid house”.&lt;br/&gt;
  After a few minutes, we all piled into Phil’s car, throwing a twelve-pack in the back seat for good measure. We drove for what seemed like an eternity, even though it was only about a twenty-minute drive. The old Combes’ house was only thirteen miles from town. As we drove and got out of town it began to get quiet. Quieter the closer we got to the house.&lt;br/&gt;
  Finally, we get to the house and begin driving up the long, crumbling cobblestone driveway. This driveway seems to go on for a mile, but maybe that was just because we had to go two miles per hour to not blow out a tire. The driveway was shrouded in trees, half-dead from the Winter that had just ended.&lt;br/&gt;
  Then we saw it, the house. The depressing looking stone and log structure stands two stories tall. Most of the windows had been broken, and half of the roof was caved in on account of the large tree sitting on the roof.&lt;br/&gt;
   “Dude...let’s..uh.. turn around,” Alex said in a nervous tone, his voice cracking slightly.&lt;br/&gt;
   I was silently thinking the same thing when Phil lets out a cry of “That driveway was forever fucking long, and I almost lost a tire about four times, I’m seeing the damn witch!”&lt;br/&gt;
  I told Phil “Eleanor Combes has been dead for almost one hundred years, dumbass. Don’t you remember any of the stories that our parents told us?”&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil responds “They say she still haunts this place, I’m going to see me a witch, bitch.”&lt;br/&gt;
  We finally park the car and begin to walk up to the house. It&amp;#39;s pitch black and we can hear gravel crunching under our feet when Phil lets out a shrill sounding yell “Ow! Fuck! I twisted my ankle!”&lt;br/&gt;
  I turn to look at him and see that he’s fine and tell him “You’re being a baby. Come on, let’s get this over with.”&lt;br/&gt;
  As we approach the front door, which is caved in almost completely, I get a chill down my spine. But, like any self-respecting college-aged guy, I ignore this feeling, not wanting to be called a bitch by Phil yet again.&lt;br/&gt;
  We had to climb through the caved-in door and when we got in we were immediately faced with a shroud of blackness.&lt;br/&gt;
   “I can’t see shit!” Alex said.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Hold on, I have a flashlight on my phone,” I said as I pulled out my phone and turned on my light.&lt;br/&gt;
  The others all did the same&lt;br/&gt;
  “Holy shit, how long has this place been abandoned?” Phil said as he moved his light across the room, illuminating a dusty, moldy, living room that is littered with broken furniture.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Uh... I don’t know, maybe seventy-five years?” I said, despite being completely clueless. We kept looking around the room and the surrounding hallways, it was just a dusty old house, no pentagrams, dead goats or sacrificed insight.&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil was rummaging through a cabinet and Alex was looking at some of the old-timey portraits on the wall.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Yo guys, check this out!” Phil says while holding up a small doll that he found in a cabinet.&lt;br/&gt;
   I knew something was wrong with this doll as soon as I saw it. It was stained brown, almost like blood had dried on it.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Uh…is that real hair…?” I asked sheepishly&lt;br/&gt;
  “I don’t know...” Phil replied, sounding almost as nervous as I am at this point. There was a single, long needle going through the doll’s head.&lt;br/&gt;
  Something was wrong, with this place, very wrong.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What the fuck is that?” Alex said nervously while pointing at an old family photo containing who must have been the Combes&lt;br/&gt;
  “Those are the witches!” Phil declared obnoxiously.&lt;br/&gt;
   “No, I mean, why is the little girl scratched out of the picture?” Alex said,  a nervous tone permeating his voice.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Uh…I’m not sure, I didn’t think the Combes had a daughter,” I said as a chill went down my spine at that moment.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Hey guys, I think we should go now, we saw that house, it’s just an old house. No witches” I said.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Yeah, maybe you’re right,” Phil said.&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil reached in his pocket to get his keys so we could leave “We have a problem, where the hell are my keys”? He asked while sounding tense.&lt;br/&gt;
“You probably dropped them while you were rummaging around in that stupid cabinet,” I said.&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil bent down and began looking around on the floor, his flashlight illuminating the damp, moldy floorboards.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What is that?” Alex asked as Phil’s light floated over a handle on the floor underneath the cabinet.&lt;br/&gt;
  “It looks like a trap door,” Phil said.&lt;br/&gt;
  Then, out of nowhere, a sickening feeling of dread, mixed with an insatiable curiosity hit me, as if there was some kind of terrible secret I just had to know, hidden underneath that door.&lt;br/&gt;
  “I’m going down there. Help me move this cabinet guys” I said.&lt;br/&gt;
  “No chance in hell!” Alex exclaimed in sheer panic at this point&lt;br/&gt;
  I get angry at this point. For no rational reason. God, we should have just left, but I remember saying “Alex, you’d better fucking help me, or else!”&lt;br/&gt;
  Phill stood there quietly, looking very nervous, until finally he chimed in “Alright man, just calm down, we’ll help you…”&lt;br/&gt;
  I hear Alex exclaim under his breath “What the hell is the matter with you man”?&lt;br/&gt;
  I didn’t know, something had just come over me. A horrible feeling, rage, disgust. I finally muster up the courage and reply “I don’t know man, there’s something wrong with this place, and I think we’ll find out if we move this drawer.”&lt;br/&gt;
 We moved the dresser, and what we found, dear God, I wish we hadn’t. Upon opening the trap door that is hidden underneath the floor we found… human remains. Partially skeletal and partially preserved.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Oh my god. We need to call the fucking cops, now!” Alex exclaimed&lt;br/&gt;
  “What the fuck…. that ‘s a fucking corpse!” Phil screamed&lt;br/&gt;
  I panicked, overcome by a sense that something truly horrible had happened here. I illuminate the body with my flashlight, it looked to be a girl, a small girl, maybe five foot tall, wearing a gray, tattered gown. With the same brownish bloodstains that were on the doll. It looked just like the doll Phil had found earlier.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What is that?” Alex said in a terrified voice while motioning to a small, leather-bound book next to the body&lt;br/&gt;
  “I… I don’t know,” I said&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil proclaimed again “We need to call the goddamn cops! I swear to god!”&lt;br/&gt;
  It was at that moment I knew, we had to read that book. “Hold on, we need to read the book…”&lt;br/&gt;
  They all have a look of sheer panic, but for some ungodly reason that I don’t know, we didn’t run then. We didn’t run while we could have. I opened the book and began to read aloud “To my dearest daughter, I’m so sorry. But you had to be kept away from the world”&lt;br/&gt;
  I felt my heart sink. This was a diary, the diary of Eleanor Combes. The stories had been true. At least partially.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Eleanor wasn’t the witch… She was” I said, gesturing towards the skeletal remains we had just unearthed.&lt;br/&gt;
  “No way. This is fake as fuck. This was murder!” Phil exclaimed&lt;br/&gt;
  “Hold on,” I said, as I continue to read, the diary outlines how after Susan, the name of the girl who’s body we unearthed, the entire family died, one by one, with Angus Combes dying of a gunshot wound to the dead while hunting, and Samuel Combes, the son, died during WWI.&lt;br/&gt;
  “The needle… through the doll’s head…” Phil’s voice cracked, “No way, man!”&lt;br/&gt;
  I continued to read. Eleanor went mad in her grief.  She locked her daughter in her room for years until finally, she made a tree fall on the house when she caused a terrible storm. Following this Eleanor did the unthinkable, she let her daughter starve to death, in her own home, and buried the body under the floorboards. But according to the diary, it took a long time for Susan to die, because she had eaten her fingers.&lt;br/&gt;
  “The tree…” Alex muttered looking up towards the ceiling which had a massive hole in it with the limbs of a large, dead willow dangling through it.&lt;br/&gt;
  I looked down at the corpse, knowing exactly what I would see. It had just one finger.&lt;br/&gt;
  I finished reading, out of an obligation to tell this poor girl&amp;#39;s story at this point, but also out of an abhorrent sense of dread.&lt;br/&gt;
It concluded with this... “To whom finds this diary, that means that you have found her. May God save your soul.”&lt;br/&gt;
  We left shortly afterward and called the police once we got back into town. We were all in shock of what we saw and after giving statements and being told that we would be facing trespassing charges, we vowed to never speak of this again, to anyone.&lt;br/&gt;
  I had hoped, we had all hoped, that we would be able to forget about what we had seen. Alas, no.&lt;br/&gt;
  That night after we had all returned home, I struggled to find any sleep, but when sleep finally came, it was interrupted. I heard a nauseating sound, a crunching, vile sound, coming from the corner of my bedroom. I could see the outline of a figure standing there, curled in the fetal position. I pick up my phone and use the flashlight to see better, it’s gone, and the sound stopped.&lt;br/&gt;
  “God, what had we found,” I thought to myself before falling back into a feverish sleep.&lt;br/&gt;
  The next day I talked to Phil and Alex. They were exhausted. They had experienced the same disturbing apparition.&lt;br/&gt;
  “It must have been a dream,” Alex said in a shaky, nervous tone&lt;br/&gt;
  “Yeah right, you heard what the diary said. We’re cursed.” Phil said in a panicked voice&lt;br/&gt;
  I hoped it was just a dream, but I knew it wasn’t. I knew that whatever we uncovered was now haunting us.&lt;br/&gt;
  For a few weeks, we continued to have the same vision at night. We continued to talk about it every day, despite saying that we would try to forget about it. We couldn’t. She had latched onto us.&lt;br/&gt;
  One night, about two weeks after the first apparition, it got worse. As I slept the same uneasy sleep that had been so common for me I saw the same silhouette again, except this time it was standing. And it was closer to the end of my bed. I heard the same disgusting sound, almost as if…&lt;br/&gt;
  “No...God no” I said to thought&lt;br/&gt;
  I picked up my phone off the nightstand and used it to illuminate this figure in front of me, and I wish I hadn’t. There she was, in her tattered clothes, the gray, rotten flesh peeling off her bones. She looked down at the floor, her long black hair partially obstructing her face.&lt;br/&gt;
  I threw up all over my sheets at what I saw next. She was gnawing through her fingers and swallowing them. Thick, black blood dripping onto my floor and filling up her rotten mouth. I screamed, petrified of the horror that was sitting in front of me.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What the hell is going on?!” My mother screamed as she barged through my door and turned the lights on. The apparition vanished.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What happened? Are you sick?” My mom said in a panicked voice upon seeing my vomit on the floor.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Uh… Nothing mom, I must have had some kind of fever dream and then threw up.”&lt;br/&gt;
  Upon hearing this my mom calmed down and finally left. I cleaned up my vomit, but I wasn’t able to fall back asleep. I couldn&amp;#39;t see her...that thing, again.&lt;br/&gt;
  The next day I told my friends what had happened, the same thing had happened to them.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What does she want? Like why is she here man?” Alex said in a shaky voice&lt;br/&gt;
  “I don’t know. I wish I did.” I said&lt;br/&gt;
  “There’s nothing we can do. She won’t leave us alone, she’s a fucking ghost!. We should have never gone to that damn house!” Phil said, following up with an apology “I’m so sorry, this was all my fault. I just wanted to see the witch house…”&lt;br/&gt;
  “It’s okay…We all thought it was fake.” I replied, feeling crushed.&lt;br/&gt;
  We were all unsure, and very afraid. What did she want? How would we make her stop?&lt;br/&gt;
  A few nights passed, with nothing happening. Had whatever we disturbed turned it’s gaze away from us? I wish, but sadly, no.&lt;br/&gt;
  Things only got worse from here.&lt;br/&gt;
  I don’t remember how many days had passed, but I was once again awakened by the sound of gnashing flesh and crunching bone. The stench of something long dead assailed my nostrils.&lt;br/&gt;
  I sat up immediately and looked around my room, but I didn’t have to look far. She was standing right next to my bed. Less than a foot from me.&lt;br/&gt;
  I tried to scream, but no air escaped my lungs.&lt;br/&gt;
  There I was, looking directly at her. Her matted, black hair no longer covers her face. I could see the coagulated blood on her face. Her eyes, or lack thereof, stared into my soul. I looked directly into her cavern-like eye sockets and was overcome by a sense of pure dread. This was something very evil, and it had set its sights on me.&lt;br/&gt;
   It was standing a foot from me.&lt;br/&gt;
  This encounter felt like an eternity but was had lasted only a few seconds. It ended when she lifted her mangled, rotting hand and pointed at me with the one finger she had left. Blood dripping all over me at this point.&lt;br/&gt;
  I was frozen.&lt;br/&gt;
  She opened her mouth, and let out a groan as if she was trying to scream but her vocal cords had decayed away.&lt;br/&gt;
I knew that I was going to die at that moment, but then, she vanished.&lt;br/&gt;
  The following day we all met again, we had to do something about this. We had to find out what was afflicting us. Alex’s’ parents&amp;#39; kitchen made a strange venue to discuss the entity that was haunting us.&lt;br/&gt;
  “There is no way I am going back to that house!” Alex exclaimed&lt;br/&gt;
  I explained to him that we had to and that we would be no worse off than we are now.&lt;br/&gt;
  Phil was silent. A miracle considering we could rarely get him to shut up, but we could tell something was wrong.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What did you see?” I asked, confused at his silence and lack of emotion.&lt;br/&gt;
  “I don’t know what happened, but that thing, it crawled on top of me last night,” Phil said, his emotionless face contorting into one of repulsion and fear.&lt;br/&gt;
  We looked at him, concerned that he was telling us, and before we could speak he followed up with a shaky voice “She’s evil. She wants us to suffer the same way that she did.”&lt;br/&gt;
  Our conversation fell mute after that. Just abject silence, but I could tell that we agreed. We had to go back to the house.&lt;br/&gt;
  It was settled. We returned to the house, hoping to find more clues as to why this was happening to us.&lt;br/&gt;
  We agreed to meet back here at night because we could have to sneak back to the house. It was too risky going in broad daylight with it now being a crime scene.&lt;br/&gt;
 I returned home and  I tried to go about my day, I researched witch-hunting and how to exorcise a ghost, but it was all clearly bullshit.&lt;br/&gt;
  The entire day I could hear it. The sound of flesh and bone being gnawed on and the groan of decayed vocal cords, but I didn’t see her anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;
  I decided to head out as it got darker, and I could smell the stench of rotting flesh coming from behind me, but there was nothing. Yet.&lt;br/&gt;
  When I arrived at Alex’s’ house he was already ready to leave&lt;br/&gt;
  “Dude, let’s just get this over with,” He said in a rushed, nervous tone.&lt;br/&gt;
  “But… Where’s Phil?” I asked&lt;br/&gt;
  “He should show up soon,” He said&lt;br/&gt;
  We waited. Five minutes passed, and then thirty, and then an hour. We tried calling our friend probably a dozen times, but it went straight to voicemail.&lt;br/&gt;
  “We need to go to Phils’ house,” I said&lt;br/&gt;
  Alex agreed. We were hoping that he had just fallen asleep, but we knew something was wrong as we drove on the backroads that led to his house.&lt;br/&gt;
  It was dark and clammy out, it had started to rain. As we drove we had to keep the brights off because we could see her, standing along the road, just pointing at us as we drove by.&lt;br/&gt;
  We didn’t speak on that car ride. There was nothing to say, what was happening was impossible. Ghosts aren’t real, neither are witches, yet here we were, seeing the ghost of a witch.&lt;br/&gt;
  Finally, after what felt like an eternity of driving we saw it.&lt;br/&gt;
  My heart sunk.&lt;br/&gt;
  Sitting in a ditch, crushed against a tree, was Phils’ beat-up car, the brights still on.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Oh shit! We have to help him!” I exclaim loudly, as I slam on my brakes and stop the car.&lt;br/&gt;
  We ran over to the car, Phil was in it, but he was gone. The steering wheel had punctured his chest cavity and his head was smashed into the windshield.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What the fuck man?!” Alex said, screaming at this point “Our friend is fucking dead! All because we wanted to go into some fucking house!”&lt;br/&gt;
  “We don’t know that. Maybe he just lost control…” I replied, knowing that I was just lying to myself.&lt;br/&gt;
  But then it hit me. Phil’s hands were wrapped around the steering wheel. His fingerless hands. Well except for one, which was outstretched and pointing to a small clearing.&lt;br/&gt;
  She was standing in the clearing, staring at Alex and me. She was illuminated by the headlights from Phil’s car, and I was terrified. This thing had killed our best friend.&lt;br/&gt;
  She smiled a sickening, twisted grin, black blood flowing out from her mouth of rotten teeth.&lt;br/&gt;
  We ran and got into my car and sped off, almost going off the road at several points.  Finally, when we had gotten far enough away we could call 911.&lt;br/&gt;
  We found a spot to pull off and wait for the ambulance.&lt;br/&gt;
  Finally, we saw the lights of the ambulance coming our way. Once they passed us we followed them to the crash.&lt;br/&gt;
  When we arrived at the crash we horrified to find that Phils’ body was gone.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Do you think that she… took him…?” Alex whispered, not wanting to be overheard by the paramedics.&lt;br/&gt;
  I didn’t know. I had no idea what could have happened. Did Phil somehow survive the crash? No, that was impossible. He was dead, very dead.&lt;br/&gt;
  “I.. I don’t know…” I said, trying to sound as collected as possible.&lt;br/&gt;
  After being questioned by medics, the police arrived and asked us even more questions, we answered them to the best of our ability, but we had no real answers for them.&lt;br/&gt;
  “We need to go to the house. This has gone far enough.” I told Alex&lt;br/&gt;
  “Yeah, right. Let’s go,” he replied.&lt;br/&gt;
  The drive was tense, nerve-racking. So much had happened in the past month.&lt;br/&gt;
  “What are we going to do man? We’re fucked. She is going to kill us, just like she killed Phil!” Alex let out, yelling from my passenger seat.&lt;br/&gt;
  “We don’t know if Phil is dead. Maybe he was able to walk away...” I replied, knowing that I was wrong. I was just trying to cling onto any semblance of reality.&lt;br/&gt;
  “No one can walk away from that. Chest fucking chest was caved in!” Alex screamed, now sounding angry and frantic.&lt;br/&gt;
  I didn’t say anything, I knew that he was right. This ghost, or witch, or whatever the hell that thing is, killed our friend. I just knew it.&lt;br/&gt;
  We finally arrived at the house. The drive took what felt like an eternity. When we arrived the house was dimly lit, as if by candlelight.&lt;br/&gt;
  “She’s waiting for us,” Alex said, staring at me with transfixed eyes&lt;br/&gt;
  “What the fuck are you talking about? How do you know that?” I asked&lt;br/&gt;
  “Why else would there be fucking lights on in that place?!” Alex yelled back at me&lt;br/&gt;
  He was right. But we had to go inside, we needed answers. I mean, what hope did we have?&lt;br/&gt;
  We sprint up the dilapidated cobblestone driveway, not caring if we fall or break our legs. We dove through the broken front door and were greeted immediately by the stench of decay. I look around the house, it’s lit dimly by candles, but it was what was in the center of the floor that made me lose it.&lt;br/&gt;
  Laying in some kind of sigil on the floor, that was drawn in blood, was Phils’ body.&lt;br/&gt;
  My heart sank. Standing directly above Phils’ corpse was the ghost. Groaning in a haunting, rhythmic manner, as if saying some kind of incantation.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Fuck you, bitch!” Alex yelled as he lunged at her&lt;br/&gt;
  He ended up stumbling over Phils’ body and passing directly through the apparition, but she was gone, at the very least.&lt;br/&gt;
  “We need to get out of here! And we need to get his body out of here too. I’m not leaving him behind!” Alex said, still frantic after what had just happened.&lt;br/&gt;
  “You’re right. Let’s go.” I said, as we grabbed Phil’s remains and carried him out the door.&lt;br/&gt;
  Alex tried desperately to call the police after this, but it was no use. There was no signal.&lt;br/&gt;
  “Fuck. Fuck!” Alex let out a cry, bursting into tears and falling to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;
  I wanted to curl into a ball and let that thing take me at that moment. None of this could be real. This couldn’t be happening.&lt;br/&gt;
  “You need to get up! We have to get out of here!” I told Alex&lt;br/&gt;
  He finally got up, and we did the only thing that we could think of. We put Phil’s remains in the trunk and tried to leave.&lt;br/&gt;
  But the car wouldn’t turn over. Had I left the lights on? No, we were only in there for a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;
  Then, in my rearview mirror, I saw her. Sitting in the back seat, reaching up to grab Alex, who is sitting next to me. I cranked the car one more time and stomped on the gas, the motor roared to life as we barreled into the house.&lt;br/&gt;
  When I came to everything was on fire. Alex was on the floor of the burning building, around 10 feet from met, next to him was my car, completely engulfed in flames.&lt;br/&gt;
  I couldn&amp;#39;t feel my legs, I tried to drag myself over to him, and as I did that thing crawled on top of him. He was thrashing and screaming but it was as though she weighed a ton, he just couldn’t move.&lt;br/&gt;
  She took her one, rotten, twisted finger and put it over his face, thick black blood was dripping all over his face. Next, she shoved the finger down his throat as he tried to scream. He flailed a twisted violently, letting out muffled screams as he was choked and suffocated on her tainted, vile blood.&lt;br/&gt;
  Next, she let out that same hellacious groan I had come to know and extracted her hand from Alex’s’ mouth. He went limp instantly, as she pulled a black, hazy mist from his body. There was one last gasp as she pulled this… the soul, out of my friend. She proceeded to open her decayed mouth wide, her jaw seeming to unhinge, and devoured the black mist that came from Alex’s body. He was dead.  I knew it.&lt;br/&gt;
  I let out a cry “God help me!” I screamed, as the building burned and the world went black. As I slipped into unconsciousness, she crawled towards me.  The last thing I remember was her gangly, rotten limbs crawling across the floor, her decaying mouth open wide, and her hand outstretched towards me.&lt;br/&gt;
  I woke up four days later, in the hospital. I was badly burned, and I’m now paralyzed from the waist down. I guess part of the ceiling fell on me as the building burned. The firefighters aren’t sure how I survived and say that I am lucky to be alive.&lt;br/&gt;
  But I’m not. I’m not lucky to be alive. She comes and goes, just standing in the corner, sometimes in broad daylight, even. She just stares at me, and smiles in the twisted, bloody grin, and points at me with her decayed, finger on her self mutilated hand. She groans, in that raspy tone I am all too familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know she will eventually kill me too, just like my friends, but for now, she just smiles and points, relishing in my misery and helplessness.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"Pain. Pain was all there was.. and is.. and will be. The pain, a hellfire inside the mind… burning a hole through the very fabric of consciousness, ripping away all the sensational senses. Pain like that of longing, for a lover, a mother, someone long left before. It strikes me, a tempered serpent, when I awaken. Starting from my spine and enveloping my head from the outside in. 

Through blurred vision, only chilled stone presents its embrace. The ground, moistened with thick liquid, seemed to go on for eternity. Darkness drained all color from life… from reality, and the feeling of dread went on, as the plain of agony I had been birthed into did. Shakily, I begin to stand, lunging forward in reply to the force it took to raise my weakened body from the murky depths.

What is this place? It was frozen, yet burning, deafening, yet quiet, endless, yet suffocating. There was no sky besides what appeared to be void. The walls were alike to this, besides the fact they felt looming, like towering gods. The pressure was that of the deepest hadopelagic depths, but it was internal pressure pushing outwards from my chest.
I limped through the abyss and swamp, searching for… I don't really know honestly… Why am I here? The pain crept down my spinal column to my legs and I stumbled, falling to my knees in front of the godlike nothingness that consumed me. A notch developed in my throat and I vomited a liquid with a paralleling consistency of that which surrounded me. That is when the screaming began.

Whether it was mine or another’s, I don't know, but it sent further chills down my being. I picked myself up again and began to wade through the infinity again, this time with urgency. The screaming only got louder, like a tone-deaf soprano choir singing a semitone difference in a requiem. What entity presents such vulgar protrusions to tempt my ear into insanity? Who damned me to this place? Is it the man in the lake or the man in sky? Or is it simply always been like this? I can’t remember. How long has it been since I’ve awakened? How long has it been since I’ve last eaten, or even breathed? 

The screams seemed to only resonate through my head. A perfect dome to drone the screeching hymn of death. Why am I here? How did I get here? What even is here?!? Who even am I?!?

Tears burned eyes as a secondary wretched scream like the sound of ripping metal ejected itself from my tongue. I fell to my knees once again, not in weakness, but in a pitiful display of humanity broken.
Where is the end to all of this… Does it even end at all… Is there even a point to continue on like this...
With the little strength and fight I could muster I bashed my head against the cobbled floor. Thump. Thump. Thump. Crack. Crack. The sound now echoed louder than the screams of before. The sweet release of continuous consciousness did not follow, only the splitting pain from the crevice which lined my forehead.
 
In desperation I scratched vigorously at the veins that flowed up my arms until that thick substance protruded from my flesh, warm unlike that which was on the stone. Again I waited for my thoughts and vision to die off and again they did not and with all the logical possibilities of release aside, I buried my face in the liquid in the ground.

It smelled of what I could make out to be iron and was identical to the texture of that which continues to flow from my arms. I took a swift inhalation of the substance and fire erupted from inside of me. It was as though I was confined from the inside. Trapped and unable to be let free… to simply breathe. Breathing, that which is so simple and life sustaining had been stripped from me. But again I did not lose my consciousness.

With what felt like a multiple of the eternity that had come to pass, I expelled the metallic tasting substance from my lungs and was able to withdraw air again. Again I spoke, but this time a whisper, simply one word… “Please”. I begged to anything that would listen, to those god-like walls of void that loomed over, to the infinity that burdened me, to the screaming creatures beyond my existence which never ceased, to time if it would just have regularity again, to myself or to god who as far as I know are one in the same.

,nosleep,"My name is Project #124

I don’t really remember much of anything before the lab. I don’t think I want to though. Every time I try to think of life before here I start to feel intense pain in my head. Papa says it’s better to not try and think of the past anyways. Papa gave me a journal to wright in. He said something about  learning my thought process but I personally think it’s just another means of control. Anyways today they preformed another test on me. I’ll tell you about it the best I can journal.

I live in a big bright white room. All my clothes are white and grey. I’m a male in my teens I think. Well I know I’m a male but I’m not sure how old I am. I’ve never seen another human around my age so I don’t have anyone to really compare myself too. The day started off normal enough. Papa took some of my blood to test again. He always talks to me when he draws my blood. It distracts me from the pain. “So, Project #124, how are you feeling sense your last test.” Papa asked. I love papa a lot. He isn’t super scary all the time and his voice is calming. It’s soft like my teddy bear he gave me. 

I told him the usual. I was dizzy from the blood loss and sleepy from all the pain. I even begged him not to make me take another test but then he said. “If you’re a good boy I’ll let you out
Your room longer.” So I instantly agreed for another test even though I don’t like them. I cry every test and I always pass out. I look forward to passing out but they inject me with something that wakes me up but it makes me more pain sensitive. Sometimes I puke too... it makes me sad.... but papa says it’s for the great or good and papas always right! Even if it hurts...

Papa fed me some food after the blood got extracted. I love the food. It’s see through squares that come in different colors. They don’t taste like anything but they are very filling and make me feel stronger. My favorite color squares are the orange ones. The way the light shines through it is pretty. That’s what I imagine the sun looks like during its sunset. I’ve never seen one. Papa says if everything goes right I’ll see one. While I was eating the bad men came in. Papa says it’s rude to call them that but they are so mean! They are extremely large and were these suits so that I don’t hurt them. 

One of them grabbed my arm really hard. “Be gentle. We don’t need to excite him before his testing.” Papa said sternly. I love papa! He always makes sure that the bad men don’t hurt me too bad before testing. Once I was out of my room the men surrounded me in a kind of... strategic manner? Am I using the word strategic correctly? I’ll ask papa later. One of the men pushed me really hard so I fell. When I fell to the floor the bad men stiffened and pointed there stunners at me. “Get off the floor, #124! Now!” The leader yelled.

 I know he’s the leader because he has a silver crest on his chest while the other men have bronze crest. I slowly got off the floor. I don’t want them to think of me as a threat. Whenever I move to fast they use stunners on me then restrain me. It hurts when they do that. When we finally got to the... hurt room I felt twitchy. This place always makes me hurt! I hate hurting but papa says that it’s necessary and papa is always right! 

Papa gave me a pat on the back before he told me to lay down. I started to get cold feet so I begged him not to make me. “Please don’t make me papa! I don’t want the extra outside time, this hurts to much! I don’t wanna anymore!” When papa looked at me I felt shame. “Project 124, don’t be selfish now! You know how important this is to me and this entire facility.” Papa sounded upset so I apologized for being selfish. Then I laid on the table. A strange looking person came into the room. 

He looked nothing like papa or the bad men. His chest was weird. It bounced and it was soft looking and his face was also weird as well. His face looked more delicate and his hair was longer than mine and I have really long hair! The strange man helped papa strap me to the table. I really wanted to ask what that was on his chest but my mouth was gagged. Papa says they do that so that my screams won’t cause anyone pain. The strange man then spoke.

 “Recording 3,463. Project, 124. The specimen is male. Is of African decent.” His voice was high like mine which is also weird. Before I could prepare myself the stabbed into my chest forcing out my screams. It hurt so bad but I couldn’t do anything about it. As I sobbed into the gag papa kissed me on the forehead then whispered, “You’re doing good champ!” I died after the first few stabs to my chest and stomach then Sprang back to life with great vigor as my body healed before there eyes.  I prepared myself for what came next. They cut off my finger one by one and started writing stuff down. 

I sobbed until they cut my vocal cords. Soon all I could do was let out a strange gargle as blood seeped from my mouth through the gag. Once my fingers grew back they continued the process again. This time it was different then the usual test because they brought out an mechanical saw. Then they started to go for my leg. I thrashed against the binds fearing for what was to come. I heard the heart monitor next to me beep fast and desperate as the fear consumed me. I looked over at papa with pleading eyes hoping that he’d let me go but papa seemed to avoid my eyes intentionally. I let out a blood curdling scream into the 

gag when they started hacking away at my leg. I managed to look up to see that from the knee down... my femur was gone. I shrieked and thrashed as I felt the Bone regrow. During that process they stopped to watch in fascination as the nerves and muscles started to grow slowly. I blacked out but was quickly awakened by an injection. If I remember correctly the strange man said that my leg regrowing took around an hour and thirty minutes. 

It’s a record time for me! Isn’t that amazing! Papa was so happy too!  After my leg was completely regrown they went back to cutting out my organs and watching them regrown. I looked over at the heart table. All those hearts there are mine. The my very first heart I got removed is really tiny compared to my most recent one! I wonder what they do with my hearts. They also drained my body of its blood. Freakiest feeling ever. Actually second freakiest. Watching your heart be removed while conscious is defiantly #1!

After that the bad men came back and threw me into my room. Papa yelled at them of course. After that papa read me a book and braided my hair. My hair has two braids that go straight back. I like it like that. But that wasn’t even the coolest part! He gave me this thing called a mirror and now I know what I look like. I think I look nice. I look similar to that strange human though.  I then played with my teddy bear. His name is project omega. He’s my best friend. Well second to papa! Goodness its lights out! Papa will not like it if I stay up past my bedtime.

During that process they stopped to watch in fascination as the nerves and muscles started to grow slowly. I blacked out but was quickly awakened by an injection. If I remember correctly the strange man said that my leg regrowing took around an hour and thirty minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a record time for me! Isn’t that amazing! Papa was so happy too!  After my leg was completely regrown they went back to cutting out my organs and watching them regrown. I looked over at the heart table. All those hearts there are mine. The my very first heart I got removed is really tiny compared to my most recent one! I wonder what they do with my hearts. They also drained my body of its blood. Freakiest feeling ever. Actually second freakiest. Watching your heart be removed while conscious is defiantly #1!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that the bad men came back and threw me into my room. Papa yelled at them of course. After that papa read me a book and braided my hair. My hair has two braids that go straight back. I like it like that. But that wasn’t even the coolest part! He gave me this thing called a mirror and now I know what I look like. I think I look nice. I look similar to that strange human though.  I then played with my teddy bear. His name is project omega. He’s my best friend. Well second to papa! Goodness its lights out! Papa will not like it if I stay up past my bedtime. Goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;

The new Corona Virus was spreading all around the world, and it was threatening the week of graduation. Apparently, the disease was spreading much quicker than anticipated, and it was barely delayed by the Government, but the disease got the better of the situation and spread everywhere. I just shrugged off all these scares and threats, knowing that it sure as hell is not gonna reach us, or so that's what I thought.

The loud principal got over the intercom, sounding panicked, and said; ""All students, please proceed to your respective classrooms immediately. Please prepare your emergency kits and safety masks, reported cases of a new deadly virus has been apparently spreading under the scares of the Corona Virus. I repeat, proceed to your respective classrooms, prepare your emergency kits immediately, lock all doors in the classroom, make sure every window and crack is sealed, and all is wearing safety masks. The school is now declared on lockdown.""

Panic got the better of us students, all hurriedly running to our rooms, some we're left behind. People in hazmat suits kept roaming around the school, and suddenly the atmosphere of the situation got dark. I was in section 1-B, we followed all the instructions properly, and our homeroom adviser guided us into what to do during the situation. We covered the windows with paper and tape, and sealed the door cracks with towels and cloths. And we waited, we waited until the next intercom announcement, almost an hour later.

The principal, now in a much calmer but slightly odd tone, spoke in a different voice and said ""We now advise all the homeroom advisers, please take off your masks and head outside and leave one student of the class as in charge. We encourage our advisers and coordinators to participate in the cleaning of the school grounds. You will be provided with all the necessary equipment needed. For all the students, please remain in your classrooms and stay calm, we will get back to you immediately."" Something about what the principal said was off, it sounded like he was different, inhuman, or more likely, insane.

Our homeroom adviser followed as instructed and went outside, but left one of his associated co-worker to take care of us while they handle the situation, the police had apparently been already called and is on the way. We received no more calls from the intercom for the next 2 hours and decided to turn off the lights to avoid attracting attention from the teachers operation, or something. 

And then we heard it. We heard something sharp, constantly hitting the tiles of the hallway right outside our room.

""Tick, tick, tick, tick...""

It constantly got louder and louder, and soon we we're able to make out the silhouette of what it was through the paper on the windows. 
One of my classmates blurted out ""Mr. McWright!"", which turned out to be a horrible idea. The silhouette slowly turned its head a complete ninety degrees, in a perfect motion. It's body followed right after, and then it clicked, lifted its arm, and ripped some sort of mask on, and revealing the shadow of what looks like, tentacles.

It dashed at our window and slammed its arm against the window, but without enough force to break it. It kept gnawing and grabbing at the door, until it broke.
""It broke.."" was the only thing I could say and say as a whisper. All of us panicked, running at every hiding spot we knew of the room. I managed to get in one of my classmates lockers and had a perfect view through the locker door's openings. I peeked out and got relieved, to find that everyone has found a spot in the room. I couldn't make out a view of the area near the window, but I was sure it was coming.

I've successfully hid in this locker for an hour now, that ""thing"" has been just roaming around the room, breaking our seats and scratching at metal surfaces. I don't know how I can survive like this, with the fact that, Larry, apparently got out of his spot and thought it was gone.

It wasn't, but Larry's still alive. He hid in the locker right next to mine, and loudly took a deep breath. We assumed the ""thing"" heard it. I can hear the shuffling sounds of ticking, nearing my locker door. I kept peeking through my opening, trying to get a sense of where it was. On my 14th peek, I saw it and will never think that I would be able to pass it off.

It had Mr. McWright's body, but its head was an amalgamation of tentacles, 4 sunken eyes, and a circular shaped mouth with sharp teeth. This isn't true, I thought to myself, it's just a hallucination, this isn't real.

And then it spoke. The words that I didn't want to hear and will never want to hear again.

""Hello young man, open the door already.""

I don't know what popped in my mind, but I went blank, I couldn't feel anything, my body started moving on its own, my arms shuffling like crazy, and it hit me.

This is what happened to Mr. McWright. My hand jolted out from my side and, hastily, opened the door. I didn't tell it to do that, but it did.

,nosleep,"&amp;#x200B;

As far back as I can remember, my father insisted that I had a special destiny: I was to follow in his footsteps and become a Walmart greeter. 

I remember one Friday evening, back when I was in kindergarten, when my father came home from a staff meeting. I ran up to him and asked, “How was work, Daddy?” 

His eyes lit up and he said, “I had the most amazing day at the most amazing job on the planet!” Holding his blue Walmart vest in the crook of his arm, he gave me one of those effortless, one-armed, wrap around hugs that made me feel both warm and loved.

In my mind, being a Walmart greeter was situated somewhere between F-14 fighter pilot and Ninja Turtle: it was a career steeped in mystery that promised untold adventure. My father never attempted to dispel this illusion, never said the job was demeaning, and never suggested that maybe better occupations existed.    

I had no reason to doubt him. I adored him with all my heart. The notion that my father would lie to me was an alien thought outside of the realm of possibility. 

A couple years later in Grade Two, our teacher sent home a newsletter inviting parents to come visit our classroom and tell us all about their careers. We heard from a nurse, a mechanic, and a plumber. 

After work one evening, I asked my Dad if he wanted to speak to my class and tell them all about his career as a Walmart greeter. 

“Oh no,” he said, shaking his head, “It is an immense responsibility that few can handle. Besides, if everyone had their dreams come true, it would no longer be special, right?”  

I was disappointed but I understood. 

“Cheer up my little raptor,” he said, revealing a bag of assorted plastic dinosaurs. “Look what I picked up from work!” 

Elated I jumped up and poured the contents onto the kitchen table. I selected a jet black T-rex and passed it to my father. “This is for you!” 

“Thanks!” he said. His broad smile was almost too large for his face. “I’ll cherish this always.” 

In Grade Three, a new kid moved in down the street, a hellion named Colin. As soon as we met, he took a special interest in making my life a living hell. 

I remember it was recess and I was sitting alone eating a fruit rollup in the cafeteria. Colin sat across from me and said, “Hey, I saw your Dad working down at Walmart.” 

My eyes lit up; I was so proud of my father. “Cool!” I said, “Isn’t he awesome? That’s what I’m going to do when I grow up!” 

Colin threw his head back laughing. “You dumbass! You’re going to work at Walmart too? I guess retard runs in the family.” He said it loud enough for the other kids to hear, and a couple of goons sidled up alongside Colin, smelling blood. 

I was mortified. This was the first time I had ever heard anyone criticise my Dad’s job. I had never questioned it before. Why would I? My father always assured me that he had the best job in the world. 

The bell rang before I could muster a reply. As I walked away, I heard Colin say, “Can you believe that retard wants to work at Walmart?” 

After school, I sauntered home and cried in my room. My Dad knocked softly on the door and asked, “What’s up kiddo?” 

I dried my eyes and tried to explain between sobs: “The kids at school teased me because you are a Walmart greeter.” 

He sat down on the bed beside me and gently rubbed my back. “They make fun of what they don’t understand. They cannot comprehend how special my job is, how it has the power to make all our dreams come true. Trust me.”  

I choked on spit, and sputtered, “Okay, I’ll trust you.” I gave him a big hug and said, “I love you Dad.” 

He squeezed back and said, “I love you too, son.” 

Afterwards we watched *Jurassic Park* and pretended we were dinosaurs. I was a velociraptor and he was the mighty T-Rex. 

The encounter with Colin at recess was a preview for the downhill slide my life would take. From that point forward, nonstop, inescapable bullying soon came to define my existence. Colin had an amazing talent for harassment. He skillfully turned my classmates against me, even kids I thought were friends. He came up with the hateful nickname ‘Wally Walmart.’ Every time someone said that name it felt like a mason jar of acid was tossed onto my face. I couldn’t go out for lunch or walk the hallways without hearing that hateful moniker. 

I endured years of insults and harassment. Eventually the constant degradation ate away at my self-esteem, and soon I began to seriously question my father’s plan.

I was in Grade Five when I finally built up the nerve to confront my father: “Hey Dad,” I said, “What if I don’t want to become a Walmart greeter?” 

Initially he looked shocked, but then he sighed and his features relaxed. He sat down beside me and said, “I knew this question would come up one day. I can’t say I haven’t been dreading it. Never lose sight of our goal. You have to trust me on this; it will all make sense one day.” 

“But. . . what if I want to do something else? Like, become a doctor or a fireman,” I said. 

He shook his head. “No, you must push those thoughts out of your head. You must stay focused, and stick to the plan. You have a great responsibility. When you turn eighteen, you are going to become a Walmart greeter and work alongside me. And that is final.” 

“But . . !” I said. 

“No buts! Trust me.” 

He never lost his temper, but I could tell I had hit a nerve. I let it drop then, but the thought continued to linger and fester in my mind.  

In Grade Six, my Dad started seeing this nice lady named Lois. She always came by on Friday nights, just before the weekly staff meetings. Without fail she greeted me with a bag of assorted candies; she guessed correctly that sugar was a golden ticket to secure my approval. 

Then one day she stopped coming by. I recall my Dad was really upset. This was extraordinarily out of character: he was always in high spirits, even after a long day at work. 

I finally understood my father’s mood when we went to Lois's Funeral. I asked what happened and was told that she had a stroke. 

I remember I was filling a plate with sweets at her memorial service when I heard from an adjoining room my Dad arguing with a bearded man. 

“Maury, you got to understand. The rock needs to be fed, we had no choice.” I’d seen him before; he was one of my father’s coworkers.   

“I know,” my father replied, “I just wish it didn’t have to be her.” 

“Who else then? You? Your son?” The man placed his hand on my father’s shoulder, but he brushed it aside and stormed off. It was one of the few times I’ve ever seen my father upset.

I wanted to follow him, tell him everything was going to be OK, and comfort him like he always comforted me.

I had so many questions: I wanted to know what my father and the bearded man were arguing about; I wanted to know why Lois’s casket was closed when she had a stroke; and I wanted to know why everything smelled so strongly of ozone. I never asked any of these questions, figuring it was not a good time; instead, I went back to my plate of sweets. 

As I grew into adolescence, I took to routinely defying my father’s wishes. The constant refrain of ‘trust me’ was growing thinner and the elaborate fantasy he had spent my life building was crumbling. 

Soon I came to absolutely loathe the idea of becoming a Walmart greeter. Every time I thought about it, my mind was thrust into the nightmare gauntlet of jeers and insults hurled at me by my peers. And since my father was responsible for this, by extension I began to hate him as well. If not for him, I would not be ‘Wally Walmart’.    

“There is no goddamn way I am going to become a Walmart greeter!” I shouted at my thirteenth birthday. Since I was a social pariah, it was just the two of us.

“Please, you are still young,” he said, “You’ll understand when you are older. *Trust me*.” 

“No!” I shouted. “I know I can do better than that! Why won’t you tell me what is so special about that stupid job?” 

He paused and for a moment it almost looked like he was going to explain everything and finally reveal the arcane truths of his so-called wonderful job. 

“Look,” he said, “I cannot tell you much. You know that. But understand that standing at the front of the store is just a small part.”

“I know what you do!” I shouted. “You smile and nod at people! That’s it!” I was screaming myself hoarse; all the resentment was pouring out. 

As I escalated, so did my father. “No!” he hollered back. “You cannot comprehend the feeling of freedom that is both primal and ancient; if you just stick to the plan, touch the rock of dreams, you will experience a life that few before you have ever contemplated.”

“Rock of dreams? What does that even mean!” I demanded.

He looked me right in the eyes, pursed his lips and said “I’ve already said too much. When you were younger it was so much easier. Remember? We’d play dinosaurs and you believed everything I said. I need you to remember what that was like.  I need you to trust me.” 

I’d heard that a million times.  I stormed away and slammed my bedroom door behind me. 

The bullying followed me into high school. Now I was ‘Wally Walmart’ to an even larger, more intimidating group of teenagers. And Colin was always there, like a tumor.

Colin was an innovative bully. He managed to turn ‘Wally Walmart’ into a song that all my classmates somehow managed to memorize. Even my math teacher accidentally referred to me once as ‘Wally.’ 

My mind went in directions so morbid that I surprised myself. Sitting in class, I daydreamed about all the unspeakably horrible things I wanted to do to Colin. In Biology I imagined giving Colin a case of Ebola and watching as he bled out from every orifice. In Math class I fantasized stabbing him in the eye with the pointy end of a compass, then slitting his throat with a sharpened protractor. In gym class I envisioned Colin being pummeled with dodgeballs, pleading for mercy as all my tormentors turned on him. 

My favorite murder fantasy, one that I kept revisiting, involved me turning into a velociraptor and ripping Colin into tattered, bloody shreds. Imagining his agonised screams brought me a degree of peace that was wholly lacking in my life. 

I was in the middle of a fantastic death scenario when Colin brought me tumbling back to reality. “Hey shitstain,” he said, “I saw your Dad at Walmart again. He waved at me and I popped him the bird. What do you think about that?” 

I tried to ignore him; I hated Colin so much, but I hated my father more for providing Colin with all his degrading ammunition. 

I was on the cusp of finishing high school when my father passed away. In the weeks prior to his death, I was so overcome with resentment that we barely spoke. Despite sharing a house with him, I would avoid eye contact and pretend he was a piece of furniture; and on the few occasions we did speak, he would do his best to insinuate into the conversation my future as a Walmart greeter. Invariably this would piss me off and I would return to mentally erasing him from my reality.   

Then came the heart attack and the time we had left together was counted in days. When I came to the hospital to visit him, I knew that it might be the last time we would ever speak. I was afraid he was going to bring up the job again and that I would overreact. I did not want our last words together to be an argument.

I trembled as I entered his hospital room. I saw that he was awake and he tried sitting up, but the effort was too great. He settled back down heavily. 

I came closer and sat down beside him. He wheezed as he struggled to speak: “I’m sorry son. I know your life hasn’t been easy and I know a lot of that blame falls on my shoulders.” 

He started coughing and his whole body convulsed. He continued: “I have held back on telling you the secrets of my job. I know you feel like I have been deceiving you, that for your whole life I have been defending a deadend garbage job.”

I felt my blood rush and I pursed my lips. He saw that I was becoming furious, and with the last bit of his energy, raised his hand. 

“I understand your rage, your fury. I just want you to know that, despite withholding information, I have never deceived you. The job is truly the key to unlocking your dreams.” 

That was too much; I couldn’t stand it anymore. Even now on his deathbed he continued to reiterate the same bullshit. 

Without another word I stormed out of the room. 

That was the last time I spoke with him. Later that day he was struck by a second heart attack, the one that ended his life. 

Now, without my father, I was alone. 

When I turned eighteen a few months later, I felt lost. I had long taken for granted all the wonderful things my father did for me: he bought and prepared all our meals and provided a roof over my head. Most of all, he loved me and, despite my adolescent belligerence, I loved him too. I missed him dearly, and I regretted being such an unrepentant shithead.

With my father gone, I was on my own without a life preserver. It was time to enter the workforce, but all I had was my high school diploma. There aren’t a lot of options out there for people without a degree.  Even dishwashing and landscaping required references and two years minimum experience. I handed out my resume to dozens of businesses without a single call back.

After my father’s death I had time to reflect on his life and soon I developed a degree of empathy that was absent while he was alive. I realized in hindsight how rough his life truly was: he was a single parent raising a kid with a minimum wage job. He was trapped in a less than ideal career that he kept for my sake, to keep me fed with a roof over my head. And I was less than ungrateful; I shunned him for his sacrifice. 

It wasn’t his fault I was teased in school. It was Colin’s. Maybe I should have stood up to the bullies instead of passively enduring their blows. I was a coward and always ready to blame my father for my failings. 

I was pondering my situation when I got a phone call. “Hey, is this Maury’s kid? Want a job?” It was one of my Dad’s coworkers. I recognized his voice as the bearded man from the funeral. 

I’d spent much of my life digging in my heels and actively rejecting the idea. And yet, I was desperate. I needed a job or soon I would be homeless. 

A part of me thought that maybe if I took this job, I could make amends to my father for the way I treated him.

So I put aside years of pent up loathing to become a Walmart greeter. 

On my first day, they gave me a name tag and a used uniform that smelled like new sweat and old milk. I was brought into a claustrophobic office and was forced to watch a dull training video. I felt like the narrator was talking down to me: be polite to the customers, always smile, and try to make a non-hostile amount of eye contact. 

My new supervisor brought me to the staff room. He said he was giving me my father’s old locker. I saw the name ‘Maury’ still taped next to an old combination lock. Inside it was empty except for a jet-black plastic tyrannosaurus rex. I didn't cry, but I wanted to. 

Then I was ushered towards the front automatic doors to finally commence my career as a Walmart greeter. 

And you know what?  It was exactly how I thought it would be: I smiled and nodded at hundreds of disinterested people. There were no surprises. “This is it?” I wondered to myself. It was easy money, albeit extremely boring. 

Initially I thought it wasn’t so bad. 

But then Colin came in. 

“Hey look who it is! It’s fucking Wally Walmart! Like father, like son! Man, you’re as pathetic as your old man.” 

I have never been so instantly furious in my entire life. I wanted to strike him down with a volley of blows and stab him in the face with a dull steak knife. Instead, I did what the training video said: I smiled and nodded. 

He laughed and said, “Hang in there numbnuts! You got a lifetime of smiling and nodding ahead of you! Ah man, this is fantastic! I was worried that after graduation I’d never see you again. Now, I can visit you everyday! I’ll tell everyone that Wally Walmart has a job at Walmart!”

He grabbed a handcart and I heard him cackling as he disappeared into the bowels of the store. 

By the end of the day I was a wreck. All my suspicions were confirmed: the job sucked. There was nothing magical about it. My dreams were not coming true. Part of me still hoped that maybe my Dad was right, maybe there was some aspect to this job that was extraordinary. But then Colin’s shiteating grin intruded, and I felt nothing but shame. 

I was about to head home when one of the other greeters stopped me. “Hey, where are you going? You’re gonna miss the staff meeting.” It was the bearded man.  

“What? Okay, yeah, sure,” I said. I was seriously contemplating not showing up the next day, but I was too fatigued to offer any resistance when he gave me a nudge outside.  

In the parking lot we found a lineup of a dozen people in Walmart vests climbing onto an old school bus. 

The bearded man hollered, “Hey everyone! This is Maury’s kid!” 

Everyone’s eyes lit up. One of the greeters said, “You’re in for a hell of a night, son!” and another said, “We sure miss your father, but don’t worry, you’ll see him again soon!” 

I didn’t know what that meant; I was confused and tired and offered no resistance to being ushered onto the bus.

As the bus drove us further out of town my curiosity began to grow. I wondered where we were going and why everyone was so excited. Moreover, why wasn’t the staff meeting  back at Walmart in the clearly marked ‘Staff Room’. 

Soon the bus turned on to a winding dirt road that skirted around a dense forest.

I asked the person sitting beside me, “What are we doing here?” 

They laughed and said, “We are going to make our dreams come true!” 

I didn’t push further. I felt nervousness flutter inside my chest.

Soon we neared a large gate that swung open, allowing the bus to enter. We traveled through a dense corridor of foliage. Finally, the bus stopped and everyone poured out.  

I hesitantly stepped out of the bus and scanned my surroundings. I was surprised to find that we were in the middle of an open meadow with no buildings to be seen, just an impenetrable wall of trees. About a hundred feet away from the bus, at the centermost point of the meadow, was a minivan-sized hunk of volcanic rock. Everyone walked towards it and, not wanting to be left behind, I followed. As I drew closer, the stone seemed to emit, ever so slightly, a dull neon-green glow. The distinct smell of ozone filled the air. 

The bearded man saw my confusion and broke off from the group. “What are we doing here?” I asked. 

He gave me a hearty pat on the back and said, “Your Dad would be so proud to see you here. Watch this.” He pointed towards an older gentleman who I recognized as one of the other greeters. His eyes were tightly closed and he wore a huge grin on his face as he approached the rock.  

Suddenly, I heard a loud *snap*, and the old man stumbled backwards. He stood back up and brushed himself off. He opened his eyes and shouted “Supper time!”

The bearded man tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Look behind you!” 

I turned around and I felt my grip on reality unhinge for a moment. Where before there was nothing but grass, was a spectacular dining room table decked out with the finest spread of food I have ever seen. There were half a dozen sumptuous, multi-tiered cakes, a steaming plate of duck *a l'orange*, and enough lobster to feed a platoon.

“How the hell did that happen?” I gasped. Once again, the bearded man pointed at another coworker. This time it was a woman; she wore the same overjoyed look on her face with her eyes squeezed shut. The same procedure repeated: when she touched the rock there was a loud *snap* and she fell backwards. 

Then, seemingly out of nowhere, an older gentleman appeared. I didn’t recognize him as a coworker and he was not with the original group. When she saw him her eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. “Oh Stanley, it is so good to see you!” They rushed towards each other and held each other in a long embrace. Then, from an unseen speaker, music began to play. The pair immediately took this a cue to start ballroom dancing.

The bearded man turned to me and said, “Your turn!” 

“My turn?” I stammered. “What do I do?”  

“Just close your eyes and approach the rock,” the bearded man said, “And your dreams will come true.” 

My mind did not want to process what was occurring around me; the logical part of my brain kept shouting that this was all some elaborate ruse, or maybe some misguided hazing ritual enacted to put the new guy in his place; but then the irrational part reminded me that my father repeated, over and over again, that the job would make my dreams would come true. 

Curiosity got the better of me, so I walked up to the rock and cautiously reached out my hand. I felt all the hairs on the back of my arm suddenly go erect, and a disorienting feeling of vertigo washed over me. The smell of ozone became overwhelming, almost choking.  When my fingertips finally made contact with the rock, I felt a sudden static shock and I stumbled backwards.  

“What happened?” I tried to say, but my mouth couldn’t properly form the words; instead, I delivered a strange, bestial *honk*. My entire body felt wrong, like all the proportions I’d grown used to had at once shifted out of place.  

The bearded man grinned at me and said, “Turn around.” I obeyed, and behind me was a large mirror. I looked at my reflection and gasped. 

I transformed into a velociraptor: I had to be at least two meters long from snout to tail, and two meters tall. I held up my hands and found that my fingers had been replaced by terrifying, three inch long claws. I did not resemble the tiny, real life feathered velociraptors known to paleontology; instead, I was the artificial beast that existed solely in the movie *Jurassic Park*.  

“What the hell is happening to me?!” I shouted. Surrounding me was a ring of Walmart greeters, all beaming with joy. 

I panicked. I needed to get out of there *now*. I broke away from the crowd and took off down the same road the bus came in on. Beside me the trees rushed by in a dark green blur. I couldn’t believe the speed as I rushed towards the front gate.  My path was blocked and there was no way around, so I backpedaled, increased my speed and jumped right over the gate. Once more I was back on the road. 

I didn’t know where else to go but back home, so I headed in that direction. Even though it was getting darker, I was confident I knew the way.  

Now on the open road I sprinted as fast as a car. I was terrified and I felt my heart machine-gun in my chest; however,  the more I ran, the more amazing I felt. This experience was really something else, something extraordinary, something I could only dream about. 

Then, like a flashbang, a message thrust itself into my brain: “FEED ME”. 

I stopped and skidded to a halt. What the hell was that? I wondered. I began running forward when, once again, the intrusive thought struck me like a seizure: “FEED ME”. 

I continued running but now I no longer felt the urge to go home. Instead, overwhelmingly, some internal drive compelled me to make a detour to Colin’s house.  

Soon I was in the alley that ran adjacent to Colin’s home. I hid myself in a row of hedges and peered into his backyard. I heard barking and found him playing with his dog. I stuck my long scaly snout out of the bushes. Suddenly, the dog looked in my direction and froze. An angry snarl followed.  

Colin bent over to pat his dog. “What is it bud?” 

Slowly the remainder of my massive bulk emerged from the bushes. “What the fuck?!” Colin shouted as he jumped into the air, falling hard onto his ass. 

I inched closer and closer to his prone and panicked form. I was going to enjoy this. I raised my weaponized claws and saw terror blanket Colin’s face. It was the most beautiful thing I’d seen in my life.

Then I tore him to shreds as his dog barked helplessly. 

I realized I was covered in head to claw in Colin’s blood. Bringing all this gore home would be a terrible idea, so I ran back to the woods. I found the gate and once more leapt over it and made my way towards the rock.  

For years I’d dreamed of all the horrible things I would do to Colin. I should have felt ashamed of what I had done. But I didn’t. The intrusive message of “FEED ME” was gone; now, I felt an overwhelming sensation of pleasure and satiety. 

As I approached the rock, I was greeted by a round of applause. 

“You did it!” the bearded man shouted. “The rock is satisfied and will not need to feed for a few more years.” He patted me on my long lizard back. “You have got a promising career as a Walmart greeter.” 

Previously that thought would have sent me into a apoplectic rage, but now everything was different. Now I felt pride. 

The bearded man had one more thing to say: “There is someone here to see you.” I looked behind him and saw towering over us a life-sized, jet black Tyrannosaurus Rex wearing a gigantic, blue Walmart vest. 

“Dad? Is that you?”",t2_3cznj,False,,1,False,My father’s lifelong wish was that I follow in his footsteps and become a Walmart greeter,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgenzg,False,dark,,public,849,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,849,,True,,False,,[],{'gid_2': 1},['writing'],True,,1583879368.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far back as I can remember, my father insisted that I had a special destiny: I was to follow in his footsteps and become a Walmart greeter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember one Friday evening, back when I was in kindergarten, when my father came home from a staff meeting. I ran up to him and asked, “How was work, Daddy?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His eyes lit up and he said, “I had the most amazing day at the most amazing job on the planet!” Holding his blue Walmart vest in the crook of his arm, he gave me one of those effortless, one-armed, wrap around hugs that made me feel both warm and loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, being a Walmart greeter was situated somewhere between F-14 fighter pilot and Ninja Turtle: it was a career steeped in mystery that promised untold adventure. My father never attempted to dispel this illusion, never said the job was demeaning, and never suggested that maybe better occupations existed.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no reason to doubt him. I adored him with all my heart. The notion that my father would lie to me was an alien thought outside of the realm of possibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple years later in Grade Two, our teacher sent home a newsletter inviting parents to come visit our classroom and tell us all about their careers. We heard from a nurse, a mechanic, and a plumber. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After work one evening, I asked my Dad if he wanted to speak to my class and tell them all about his career as a Walmart greeter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh no,” he said, shaking his head, “It is an immense responsibility that few can handle. Besides, if everyone had their dreams come true, it would no longer be special, right?”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed but I understood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cheer up my little raptor,” he said, revealing a bag of assorted plastic dinosaurs. “Look what I picked up from work!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elated I jumped up and poured the contents onto the kitchen table. I selected a jet black T-rex and passed it to my father. “This is for you!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thanks!” he said. His broad smile was almost too large for his face. “I’ll cherish this always.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Grade Three, a new kid moved in down the street, a hellion named Colin. As soon as we met, he took a special interest in making my life a living hell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember it was recess and I was sitting alone eating a fruit rollup in the cafeteria. Colin sat across from me and said, “Hey, I saw your Dad working down at Walmart.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes lit up; I was so proud of my father. “Cool!” I said, “Isn’t he awesome? That’s what I’m going to do when I grow up!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin threw his head back laughing. “You dumbass! You’re going to work at Walmart too? I guess retard runs in the family.” He said it loud enough for the other kids to hear, and a couple of goons sidled up alongside Colin, smelling blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mortified. This was the first time I had ever heard anyone criticise my Dad’s job. I had never questioned it before. Why would I? My father always assured me that he had the best job in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bell rang before I could muster a reply. As I walked away, I heard Colin say, “Can you believe that retard wants to work at Walmart?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After school, I sauntered home and cried in my room. My Dad knocked softly on the door and asked, “What’s up kiddo?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dried my eyes and tried to explain between sobs: “The kids at school teased me because you are a Walmart greeter.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sat down on the bed beside me and gently rubbed my back. “They make fun of what they don’t understand. They cannot comprehend how special my job is, how it has the power to make all our dreams come true. Trust me.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choked on spit, and sputtered, “Okay, I’ll trust you.” I gave him a big hug and said, “I love you Dad.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He squeezed back and said, “I love you too, son.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we watched &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; and pretended we were dinosaurs. I was a velociraptor and he was the mighty T-Rex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter with Colin at recess was a preview for the downhill slide my life would take. From that point forward, nonstop, inescapable bullying soon came to define my existence. Colin had an amazing talent for harassment. He skillfully turned my classmates against me, even kids I thought were friends. He came up with the hateful nickname ‘Wally Walmart.’ Every time someone said that name it felt like a mason jar of acid was tossed onto my face. I couldn’t go out for lunch or walk the hallways without hearing that hateful moniker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I endured years of insults and harassment. Eventually the constant degradation ate away at my self-esteem, and soon I began to seriously question my father’s plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Grade Five when I finally built up the nerve to confront my father: “Hey Dad,” I said, “What if I don’t want to become a Walmart greeter?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially he looked shocked, but then he sighed and his features relaxed. He sat down beside me and said, “I knew this question would come up one day. I can’t say I haven’t been dreading it. Never lose sight of our goal. You have to trust me on this; it will all make sense one day.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But. . . what if I want to do something else? Like, become a doctor or a fireman,” I said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head. “No, you must push those thoughts out of your head. You must stay focused, and stick to the plan. You have a great responsibility. When you turn eighteen, you are going to become a Walmart greeter and work alongside me. And that is final.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But . . !” I said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No buts! Trust me.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He never lost his temper, but I could tell I had hit a nerve. I let it drop then, but the thought continued to linger and fester in my mind.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Grade Six, my Dad started seeing this nice lady named Lois. She always came by on Friday nights, just before the weekly staff meetings. Without fail she greeted me with a bag of assorted candies; she guessed correctly that sugar was a golden ticket to secure my approval. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day she stopped coming by. I recall my Dad was really upset. This was extraordinarily out of character: he was always in high spirits, even after a long day at work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally understood my father’s mood when we went to Lois&amp;#39;s Funeral. I asked what happened and was told that she had a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember I was filling a plate with sweets at her memorial service when I heard from an adjoining room my Dad arguing with a bearded man. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maury, you got to understand. The rock needs to be fed, we had no choice.” I’d seen him before; he was one of my father’s coworkers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know,” my father replied, “I just wish it didn’t have to be her.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who else then? You? Your son?” The man placed his hand on my father’s shoulder, but he brushed it aside and stormed off. It was one of the few times I’ve ever seen my father upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to follow him, tell him everything was going to be OK, and comfort him like he always comforted me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had so many questions: I wanted to know what my father and the bearded man were arguing about; I wanted to know why Lois’s casket was closed when she had a stroke; and I wanted to know why everything smelled so strongly of ozone. I never asked any of these questions, figuring it was not a good time; instead, I went back to my plate of sweets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I grew into adolescence, I took to routinely defying my father’s wishes. The constant refrain of ‘trust me’ was growing thinner and the elaborate fantasy he had spent my life building was crumbling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I came to absolutely loathe the idea of becoming a Walmart greeter. Every time I thought about it, my mind was thrust into the nightmare gauntlet of jeers and insults hurled at me by my peers. And since my father was responsible for this, by extension I began to hate him as well. If not for him, I would not be ‘Wally Walmart’.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no goddamn way I am going to become a Walmart greeter!” I shouted at my thirteenth birthday. Since I was a social pariah, it was just the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please, you are still young,” he said, “You’ll understand when you are older. &lt;em&gt;Trust me&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No!” I shouted. “I know I can do better than that! Why won’t you tell me what is so special about that stupid job?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He paused and for a moment it almost looked like he was going to explain everything and finally reveal the arcane truths of his so-called wonderful job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look,” he said, “I cannot tell you much. You know that. But understand that standing at the front of the store is just a small part.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know what you do!” I shouted. “You smile and nod at people! That’s it!” I was screaming myself hoarse; all the resentment was pouring out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I escalated, so did my father. “No!” he hollered back. “You cannot comprehend the feeling of freedom that is both primal and ancient; if you just stick to the plan, touch the rock of dreams, you will experience a life that few before you have ever contemplated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rock of dreams? What does that even mean!” I demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked me right in the eyes, pursed his lips and said “I’ve already said too much. When you were younger it was so much easier. Remember? We’d play dinosaurs and you believed everything I said. I need you to remember what that was like.  I need you to trust me.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d heard that a million times.  I stormed away and slammed my bedroom door behind me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bullying followed me into high school. Now I was ‘Wally Walmart’ to an even larger, more intimidating group of teenagers. And Colin was always there, like a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin was an innovative bully. He managed to turn ‘Wally Walmart’ into a song that all my classmates somehow managed to memorize. Even my math teacher accidentally referred to me once as ‘Wally.’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind went in directions so morbid that I surprised myself. Sitting in class, I daydreamed about all the unspeakably horrible things I wanted to do to Colin. In Biology I imagined giving Colin a case of Ebola and watching as he bled out from every orifice. In Math class I fantasized stabbing him in the eye with the pointy end of a compass, then slitting his throat with a sharpened protractor. In gym class I envisioned Colin being pummeled with dodgeballs, pleading for mercy as all my tormentors turned on him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite murder fantasy, one that I kept revisiting, involved me turning into a velociraptor and ripping Colin into tattered, bloody shreds. Imagining his agonised screams brought me a degree of peace that was wholly lacking in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in the middle of a fantastic death scenario when Colin brought me tumbling back to reality. “Hey shitstain,” he said, “I saw your Dad at Walmart again. He waved at me and I popped him the bird. What do you think about that?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to ignore him; I hated Colin so much, but I hated my father more for providing Colin with all his degrading ammunition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the cusp of finishing high school when my father passed away. In the weeks prior to his death, I was so overcome with resentment that we barely spoke. Despite sharing a house with him, I would avoid eye contact and pretend he was a piece of furniture; and on the few occasions we did speak, he would do his best to insinuate into the conversation my future as a Walmart greeter. Invariably this would piss me off and I would return to mentally erasing him from my reality.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the heart attack and the time we had left together was counted in days. When I came to the hospital to visit him, I knew that it might be the last time we would ever speak. I was afraid he was going to bring up the job again and that I would overreact. I did not want our last words together to be an argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trembled as I entered his hospital room. I saw that he was awake and he tried sitting up, but the effort was too great. He settled back down heavily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came closer and sat down beside him. He wheezed as he struggled to speak: “I’m sorry son. I know your life hasn’t been easy and I know a lot of that blame falls on my shoulders.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started coughing and his whole body convulsed. He continued: “I have held back on telling you the secrets of my job. I know you feel like I have been deceiving you, that for your whole life I have been defending a deadend garbage job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt my blood rush and I pursed my lips. He saw that I was becoming furious, and with the last bit of his energy, raised his hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I understand your rage, your fury. I just want you to know that, despite withholding information, I have never deceived you. The job is truly the key to unlocking your dreams.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was too much; I couldn’t stand it anymore. Even now on his deathbed he continued to reiterate the same bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without another word I stormed out of the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the last time I spoke with him. Later that day he was struck by a second heart attack, the one that ended his life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, without my father, I was alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned eighteen a few months later, I felt lost. I had long taken for granted all the wonderful things my father did for me: he bought and prepared all our meals and provided a roof over my head. Most of all, he loved me and, despite my adolescent belligerence, I loved him too. I missed him dearly, and I regretted being such an unrepentant shithead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my father gone, I was on my own without a life preserver. It was time to enter the workforce, but all I had was my high school diploma. There aren’t a lot of options out there for people without a degree.  Even dishwashing and landscaping required references and two years minimum experience. I handed out my resume to dozens of businesses without a single call back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my father’s death I had time to reflect on his life and soon I developed a degree of empathy that was absent while he was alive. I realized in hindsight how rough his life truly was: he was a single parent raising a kid with a minimum wage job. He was trapped in a less than ideal career that he kept for my sake, to keep me fed with a roof over my head. And I was less than ungrateful; I shunned him for his sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t his fault I was teased in school. It was Colin’s. Maybe I should have stood up to the bullies instead of passively enduring their blows. I was a coward and always ready to blame my father for my failings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pondering my situation when I got a phone call. “Hey, is this Maury’s kid? Want a job?” It was one of my Dad’s coworkers. I recognized his voice as the bearded man from the funeral. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d spent much of my life digging in my heels and actively rejecting the idea. And yet, I was desperate. I needed a job or soon I would be homeless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of me thought that maybe if I took this job, I could make amends to my father for the way I treated him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I put aside years of pent up loathing to become a Walmart greeter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first day, they gave me a name tag and a used uniform that smelled like new sweat and old milk. I was brought into a claustrophobic office and was forced to watch a dull training video. I felt like the narrator was talking down to me: be polite to the customers, always smile, and try to make a non-hostile amount of eye contact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new supervisor brought me to the staff room. He said he was giving me my father’s old locker. I saw the name ‘Maury’ still taped next to an old combination lock. Inside it was empty except for a jet-black plastic tyrannosaurus rex. I didn&amp;#39;t cry, but I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I was ushered towards the front automatic doors to finally commence my career as a Walmart greeter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know what?  It was exactly how I thought it would be: I smiled and nodded at hundreds of disinterested people. There were no surprises. “This is it?” I wondered to myself. It was easy money, albeit extremely boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought it wasn’t so bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then Colin came in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey look who it is! It’s fucking Wally Walmart! Like father, like son! Man, you’re as pathetic as your old man.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never been so instantly furious in my entire life. I wanted to strike him down with a volley of blows and stab him in the face with a dull steak knife. Instead, I did what the training video said: I smiled and nodded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laughed and said, “Hang in there numbnuts! You got a lifetime of smiling and nodding ahead of you! Ah man, this is fantastic! I was worried that after graduation I’d never see you again. Now, I can visit you everyday! I’ll tell everyone that Wally Walmart has a job at Walmart!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He grabbed a handcart and I heard him cackling as he disappeared into the bowels of the store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day I was a wreck. All my suspicions were confirmed: the job sucked. There was nothing magical about it. My dreams were not coming true. Part of me still hoped that maybe my Dad was right, maybe there was some aspect to this job that was extraordinary. But then Colin’s shiteating grin intruded, and I felt nothing but shame. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about to head home when one of the other greeters stopped me. “Hey, where are you going? You’re gonna miss the staff meeting.” It was the bearded man.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? Okay, yeah, sure,” I said. I was seriously contemplating not showing up the next day, but I was too fatigued to offer any resistance when he gave me a nudge outside.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the parking lot we found a lineup of a dozen people in Walmart vests climbing onto an old school bus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearded man hollered, “Hey everyone! This is Maury’s kid!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s eyes lit up. One of the greeters said, “You’re in for a hell of a night, son!” and another said, “We sure miss your father, but don’t worry, you’ll see him again soon!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what that meant; I was confused and tired and offered no resistance to being ushered onto the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the bus drove us further out of town my curiosity began to grow. I wondered where we were going and why everyone was so excited. Moreover, why wasn’t the staff meeting  back at Walmart in the clearly marked ‘Staff Room’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the bus turned on to a winding dirt road that skirted around a dense forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked the person sitting beside me, “What are we doing here?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They laughed and said, “We are going to make our dreams come true!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t push further. I felt nervousness flutter inside my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon we neared a large gate that swung open, allowing the bus to enter. We traveled through a dense corridor of foliage. Finally, the bus stopped and everyone poured out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hesitantly stepped out of the bus and scanned my surroundings. I was surprised to find that we were in the middle of an open meadow with no buildings to be seen, just an impenetrable wall of trees. About a hundred feet away from the bus, at the centermost point of the meadow, was a minivan-sized hunk of volcanic rock. Everyone walked towards it and, not wanting to be left behind, I followed. As I drew closer, the stone seemed to emit, ever so slightly, a dull neon-green glow. The distinct smell of ozone filled the air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearded man saw my confusion and broke off from the group. “What are we doing here?” I asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave me a hearty pat on the back and said, “Your Dad would be so proud to see you here. Watch this.” He pointed towards an older gentleman who I recognized as one of the other greeters. His eyes were tightly closed and he wore a huge grin on his face as he approached the rock.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I heard a loud &lt;em&gt;snap&lt;/em&gt;, and the old man stumbled backwards. He stood back up and brushed himself off. He opened his eyes and shouted “Supper time!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearded man tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Look behind you!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned around and I felt my grip on reality unhinge for a moment. Where before there was nothing but grass, was a spectacular dining room table decked out with the finest spread of food I have ever seen. There were half a dozen sumptuous, multi-tiered cakes, a steaming plate of duck &lt;em&gt;a l&amp;#39;orange&lt;/em&gt;, and enough lobster to feed a platoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How the hell did that happen?” I gasped. Once again, the bearded man pointed at another coworker. This time it was a woman; she wore the same overjoyed look on her face with her eyes squeezed shut. The same procedure repeated: when she touched the rock there was a loud &lt;em&gt;snap&lt;/em&gt; and she fell backwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, seemingly out of nowhere, an older gentleman appeared. I didn’t recognize him as a coworker and he was not with the original group. When she saw him her eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. “Oh Stanley, it is so good to see you!” They rushed towards each other and held each other in a long embrace. Then, from an unseen speaker, music began to play. The pair immediately took this a cue to start ballroom dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearded man turned to me and said, “Your turn!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My turn?” I stammered. “What do I do?”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just close your eyes and approach the rock,” the bearded man said, “And your dreams will come true.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind did not want to process what was occurring around me; the logical part of my brain kept shouting that this was all some elaborate ruse, or maybe some misguided hazing ritual enacted to put the new guy in his place; but then the irrational part reminded me that my father repeated, over and over again, that the job would make my dreams would come true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiosity got the better of me, so I walked up to the rock and cautiously reached out my hand. I felt all the hairs on the back of my arm suddenly go erect, and a disorienting feeling of vertigo washed over me. The smell of ozone became overwhelming, almost choking.  When my fingertips finally made contact with the rock, I felt a sudden static shock and I stumbled backwards.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What happened?” I tried to say, but my mouth couldn’t properly form the words; instead, I delivered a strange, bestial &lt;em&gt;honk&lt;/em&gt;. My entire body felt wrong, like all the proportions I’d grown used to had at once shifted out of place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearded man grinned at me and said, “Turn around.” I obeyed, and behind me was a large mirror. I looked at my reflection and gasped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I transformed into a velociraptor: I had to be at least two meters long from snout to tail, and two meters tall. I held up my hands and found that my fingers had been replaced by terrifying, three inch long claws. I did not resemble the tiny, real life feathered velociraptors known to paleontology; instead, I was the artificial beast that existed solely in the movie &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell is happening to me?!” I shouted. Surrounding me was a ring of Walmart greeters, all beaming with joy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I panicked. I needed to get out of there &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. I broke away from the crowd and took off down the same road the bus came in on. Beside me the trees rushed by in a dark green blur. I couldn’t believe the speed as I rushed towards the front gate.  My path was blocked and there was no way around, so I backpedaled, increased my speed and jumped right over the gate. Once more I was back on the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know where else to go but back home, so I headed in that direction. Even though it was getting darker, I was confident I knew the way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on the open road I sprinted as fast as a car. I was terrified and I felt my heart machine-gun in my chest; however,  the more I ran, the more amazing I felt. This experience was really something else, something extraordinary, something I could only dream about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, like a flashbang, a message thrust itself into my brain: “FEED ME”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped and skidded to a halt. What the hell was that? I wondered. I began running forward when, once again, the intrusive thought struck me like a seizure: “FEED ME”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued running but now I no longer felt the urge to go home. Instead, overwhelmingly, some internal drive compelled me to make a detour to Colin’s house.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I was in the alley that ran adjacent to Colin’s home. I hid myself in a row of hedges and peered into his backyard. I heard barking and found him playing with his dog. I stuck my long scaly snout out of the bushes. Suddenly, the dog looked in my direction and froze. An angry snarl followed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin bent over to pat his dog. “What is it bud?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly the remainder of my massive bulk emerged from the bushes. “What the fuck?!” Colin shouted as he jumped into the air, falling hard onto his ass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I inched closer and closer to his prone and panicked form. I was going to enjoy this. I raised my weaponized claws and saw terror blanket Colin’s face. It was the most beautiful thing I’d seen in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I tore him to shreds as his dog barked helplessly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized I was covered in head to claw in Colin’s blood. Bringing all this gore home would be a terrible idea, so I ran back to the woods. I found the gate and once more leapt over it and made my way towards the rock.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I’d dreamed of all the horrible things I would do to Colin. I should have felt ashamed of what I had done. But I didn’t. The intrusive message of “FEED ME” was gone; now, I felt an overwhelming sensation of pleasure and satiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I approached the rock, I was greeted by a round of applause. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You did it!” the bearded man shouted. “The rock is satisfied and will not need to feed for a few more years.” He patted me on my long lizard back. “You have got a promising career as a Walmart greeter.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously that thought would have sent me into a apoplectic rage, but now everything was different. Now I felt pride. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearded man had one more thing to say: “There is someone here to see you.” I looked behind him and saw towering over us a life-sized, jet black Tyrannosaurus Rex wearing a gigantic, blue Walmart vest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dad? Is that you?”&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I get off my bus at the depot here in Greenville to connect with another that'll get me to my destination, which is Saint Louis. I'm not sure why I'm heading there, but I just have this drive to go. While sitting next to this man on my way in, he noticed I was rolling my own cigarettes and struck up a conversation. We got to talking and the man eventually opened up telling me he was on a serious drug run from Mexico to New York transporting cannabis, heroin and some unknown drug he had limited information on. The man told me he'd give me some of it if I kept my mouth shut and promised to wait until he was off the bus to take it. I of course nodded and said yes. I don't turn anything down. He handed me a tiny zip lock baggie with smiley faces and cherubs on it....

""This man's sick"", I thought to myself.

The man gets off two cities before Greenville and I decided now was the best time to try this mysterious drug he had given me. He told me to simply sprinkle it in my tobacco while rolling my next cigarette and I'll feel it immediately. I open the bag and see a light brown powdery substance that smelled like the bathroom of a French brothel; as if I was expecting something else. I was a tad apprehensive at first because I didn't know what to expect, or what to feel. It couldn't be any heavier than most things I've taken before and I have another 2 hours ahead of me on this giant soda can they call a bus.

As the bus pulls up to the stop, I run out to the smoker's section like a mad man. The anxiety involved with trying this has built up tremendously and it is time to release. I spark up my secret smoke and take a deep inhale in. The cigarette tastes like tobacco and what I imagine rat poison would taste like. I inhale again and again but feel nothing. I was beginning to feel upset that I was ripped off by some low-life drug-runner when I realized it was given to me for free. I relaxed a bit, took another inhale and that's when it hit me...

I started feeling like my feet were slowly being glued to the ground. Every step felt like the concrete was pulling me closer and closer to it with no letting go in sight. The world became very bright and loud. I felt that my senses were heightened tenfold, but I was stuck with this binding paralysis. The cigarette fell from my fingers as I slowly attempted a crawl back to my bus seat. That's all I could think of... Sitting down.

I make it to the bus 30 seconds after the last call and 4 seconds before the bus took off. The driver let me on again only because he saw me get off, but cursed me under his breath for being so late to get back. I start the slow walk down the crowded aisle to my seat and see a morbidly obese man sitting where my mysterious friend was. ""Thank God I chose the window seat"" I thought to myself. ""I'll never be able to get around this fat f\*\*k in my current state.""

I finagle my way round Mr. Plump, and reach into my traveler's bag. I pull out my sunglasses to calm these brights down, a set of headphones to relax all these intense sounds and a small bottle of whiskey for my soul. I put on some old Michael Jackson tunes and try to enjoy this feeling, but every time I close my eyes I see nothing but large bubbles bouncing off and on the inside of my brain and begin to feel that I've completely lost it....

The next stop was Greenville and after looking at my watch, I realize I had roughly an hour until we were there. The blob next to me falls asleep and it was then that I noticed he reeked of ham and raw sewage. I think to myself, ""We can do this, just try to relax and enjoy the ride. ENJOY THE RIDE!"" My mind starts racing. Thinking of all the crazy things that I've been through in life, thinking about this strange man and the mystery drug I've ingested. Perhaps this was the one to say no to. Maybe I shouldn't have gone face up in this dirty mess. Now, I'm stuck here with the Stay Puffed Marshmallow wanting to dig my brains out with a spoon.

After an hour straight of running through every good and bad thing that's happened in my 28 years of existence I realize that the bus has stopped. The Prius sized beast next to me woke up and started coughing and wheezing. While choking on his own spit and gasping for breath I sit there staring. This man completely lost control of his life and let himself practically explode from over eating and little to no exercise for the past 40 or 50 years. His life span was probably cut down by a third and he will always remain unhappy. After a good three or four minutes of gawking, I push the lard out of my way to get off the bus. I tried to be patient and let him catch his breath, but with this fuel in my brain and his strong stench, I just couldn't wait any longer. I dart towards the door and dodge the angry bus driver. He said something to me, but I couldn't hear him and just kept walking.

After getting off the tin can, I realized I forgot my traveler's bag and I had to go back. I turn around to head towards the bus and just then the door morphs into a giant lion's mouth. I gasp in terror and speed walk the opposite direction towards the baggage claim area. I start sweating and panting. My heart starts beating faster and faster and I begin to feel like the Plump Bambino I was sitting with earlier. I take a seat on the concrete and place my head between my knees hoping to channel this excess energy and fear. I sit there until the lion departs again for places unknown. I knew I lost my bag, lost my phone, my money and laptop but at that point, I didn't care. I didn't want anything to do with that bus, that driver or that blimp of a man any longer.

I feel that the mystery drug might be starting to wear off and my mind begins to remold itself. I looked at my watch and I had been sitting there for over an hour. I had no luggage, no clothes and no money. It started to really set in how f\*cked I was and that I'd most likely never make it to Saint Louis. I started thinking about how I was going to make it back to my home in Spokane. I began questioning why I even left in the first place. I had a great job, a girlfriend and a home. My life was set, but I couldn't bear to live the monotonous life that I was surely doomed to lead. So one day I just got up and left. Leaving everything behind but my phone, wallet, laptop and traveler's bag, which were now on their way to some far off city in the complete opposite direction in which I'm heading, sitting next to the obese ham-man.

I start to head away from the station when I notice two men in all black staring at me. I thought I saw them out of the corner of my eye while escaping the lion's clutches but I figured they were just figments of my imagination. I have no protection and no way of letting someone know that I could potentially be in danger. I decide to stay near the station in case something happens. After walking out to the main road, I realize there's nothing in sight for miles either way. I look behind me as I walk back to the station door and the men were still standing and staring. I go in to speak to the ticket clerk to see if they'd perhaps let me use their phone to call my girlfriend. I walk up to the woman at the desk and that's when round two of this mystery drug kicks in. I see the woman staring back at me, her hair white and thin, her teeth chipped and green. I can smell her perfume and it begins to resonate in my nostrils getting stronger and stronger.

I mumble to her without being able to control the volume of my voice, ""Phone...call!... PLEASE""

She yells back ""PAYING CUSTOMERS ONLY!""

In shock, I turn around and feel the whole world collapse bellow me. Just three words turned me into a crying, sniffling, babbling waste of a human being. I begin to crawl to the outside chairs to maybe find a cigarette butt to puff on or maybe a drinking fountain to lean on. I just need something to bring me back to reality!

After what seemed like three and a half days, I make it to a chair on the outside of the station to collect my thoughts and smoke on cigarette butts. I smoke four or five ends of cigarettes until I feel like I can come to grips with everything. I have a deep internal battle as to what to do, but agreed with myself that I'll be useless until the following day. What this means now is that I'll be sleeping somewhere near this god forsaken station and I'll need to make friends with the land and its surroundings.

Out of the corner of my eye, I see the two men again. I figured they got bored waiting for me to drag my lifeless body out of the station and away from the green-toothed monster behind the desk, but they were still there! Both not moving a muscle, just staring. I can't recognize any distinguishable traits or physical characteristics about them. Just two men in all black, standing from a distance with their eyes on me. My heart begins to pound again and at this point, I feel like I WILL be having a heart attack and dying before these men get to have their way with me. Whatever way that was, I wanted no part of it.

I see one man reach behind his back, look over to his partner and show him what looked to be a very large knife with an even larger jagged edge. A fine piece of cutlery that looked like it would slash through my bones like a knife through butter. Tears started swelling up in my eyes blurring my vision. I start shaking uncontrollably and breathing even heavier than before. My head begins to pound as I realize that I'm going to die a very slow and painful death at the hands of two anonymous men in all black.

Who the f\*ck are these people?! Why are they staring at ME? What did I do to them?! I came in minding my own business, meaning no harm to anyone but myself. Why can't they accept that and leave me alone? I don't want any problems. They don't understand? Oh god they're walking closer...

I look around for something to protect myself with. A rock, a stick, anything that'll prevent me from me from the nice long cutting they're going to give me and then suddenly I see it... Like a gift from God herself, a payphone! I stumble over to it as calmly as possible which probably looked like a paraplegic learning how to breakdance to these two men, but I had to make moves and get there.

It took what seemed like another 7 or 8 hours to get to the phone booth, but once there I knew exactly who to call.

""Thank you for calling 911 sir, what is your emergency?""

I scream ""HELP ME!!! My name is Frank, my social security number is 658-89-4579 and I am going to die soon! There are these men here man.... They're going to get me""

""Ok sir can you tell me a little more about these men?""

""I'm at the train station! Come quick!""

""Sir I know where you are. Why are these men going to injure you?

""Lord Jesus I don't know! They gave me these looks then brandished a knife! It's cause of the fat man, I swear it is""

""The fat man sir?""

""The FAT MAN IN THE TIN CAN WOMAN! Do you not speak English?!? Send some of your finest officers over RIGHT AWAY!.... These men mean business""

""Ok sir, please stay on the phone with me while I dispatch a police officer""

""God damn it OK!""

I hear her clickety clacking on her keyboard while the men move closer and closer at a snail's pace. I wish something would just HAPPEN already! I want to die or be saved, either way, I don't care at this point. My mind is going to explode with anxiety, frustration and general fear. I need something to happen now. I start wishing for my death to be over with.

""Please... please...please just kill me already"" I think to myself ""Put me out of my misery!""

The woman on the pay phone chimes in, ""Sir?..... Sir are you there?... Sir someone should be out there in less than 5 minutes... SIR?!""

""WHAT WOMAN?! WHAT DO YOU WANT?!""

""Sir I've dispatched a cruiser, they should be there shortly.""

""Well it's about time! Thank YOU!""

I slam the phone down and immediately see the pigs she dispatched... At this point in time I think about the situation I'm in and how odd it's going to sound to these sober law enforcers. All the questions they're going to ask about myself, where I'm from, where I'm going and why I'm holding on to a phone booth tighter than Rose and the door at the end of Titanic. I thought and I thought and I thought some more and I decided it was time to go back in a face the green toothed, silver-headed monster at the ticket counter.

I walk in with haste this time to avoid the cops seeing me. I stand near the door, away from the woman but still able to see the two men and the police cruiser. The two officers park behind the two men still walking towards the station and pull out their service revolvers.

I hear them yell to the men, ""GET DOWN ON THE GROUND!""

No response

They repeat ""WE SAID GET DOWN ON THE GRAND AND REVEIL THE WEAPON YOU HAVE ON YOUR PERSON!!!""

At this point, they run in and tackle the two men down to the ground. I witness all this from inside of the station, curled up and around the doors and windows.

""Christ Almighty!"" I think to myself ""We've gotten ourselves into some deep deep sh!t this time!""

I run to the bathroom, avoiding the evil bag of bones at the desk. I had to clean myself up and look respectable before these pigs come in here and ask me 21 f\*\*\*king questions. I look in the mirror and actually SEE myself for the first time that day... I see myself for who I am, I see myself as others see me and I see myself as how I'd like to be. I'm a mess. I have dirt and dust all over my clothes. Spit and snot running all over the collar of my shirt. I feel just as gross as the fat man and the ticket woman combined..... I started thinking harder and harder about my situation realizing what really is happening here. All of these people were myself. The ham man that showed up on the bus was showing me how unhappy I was with my life. Gluttonous and fat, consuming as much as I could. Drinking, eating, drinking and eating some more.... The woman behind the ticket desk, mean and evil showing myself how I really thought about other people in disgust without knowing them. The prejudgment, the ignorance. I was she and she was I, and the two men.... The two men were me realizing how much of a waste I have become. Proving that I didn't care if I lived or died. I didn't care who would be affected by my actions. I just wanted what I wanted when I wanted it.

The police officers came in to the bathroom after the nice old lady at the ticket desk let them know that there was a screaming belligerent fool at her station for hours on end.

The cigarette fell from my fingers as I slowly attempted a crawl back to my bus seat. That&amp;#39;s all I could think of... Sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make it to the bus 30 seconds after the last call and 4 seconds before the bus took off. The driver let me on again only because he saw me get off, but cursed me under his breath for being so late to get back. I start the slow walk down the crowded aisle to my seat and see a morbidly obese man sitting where my mysterious friend was. &amp;quot;Thank God I chose the window seat&amp;quot; I thought to myself. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll never be able to get around this fat f**k in my current state.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finagle my way round Mr. Plump, and reach into my traveler&amp;#39;s bag. I pull out my sunglasses to calm these brights down, a set of headphones to relax all these intense sounds and a small bottle of whiskey for my soul. I put on some old Michael Jackson tunes and try to enjoy this feeling, but every time I close my eyes I see nothing but large bubbles bouncing off and on the inside of my brain and begin to feel that I&amp;#39;ve completely lost it....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was Greenville and after looking at my watch, I realize I had roughly an hour until we were there. The blob next to me falls asleep and it was then that I noticed he reeked of ham and raw sewage. I think to myself, &amp;quot;We can do this, just try to relax and enjoy the ride. ENJOY THE RIDE!&amp;quot; My mind starts racing. Thinking of all the crazy things that I&amp;#39;ve been through in life, thinking about this strange man and the mystery drug I&amp;#39;ve ingested. Perhaps this was the one to say no to. Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t have gone face up in this dirty mess. Now, I&amp;#39;m stuck here with the Stay Puffed Marshmallow wanting to dig my brains out with a spoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour straight of running through every good and bad thing that&amp;#39;s happened in my 28 years of existence I realize that the bus has stopped. The Prius sized beast next to me woke up and started coughing and wheezing. While choking on his own spit and gasping for breath I sit there staring. This man completely lost control of his life and let himself practically explode from over eating and little to no exercise for the past 40 or 50 years. His life span was probably cut down by a third and he will always remain unhappy. After a good three or four minutes of gawking, I push the lard out of my way to get off the bus. I tried to be patient and let him catch his breath, but with this fuel in my brain and his strong stench, I just couldn&amp;#39;t wait any longer. I dart towards the door and dodge the angry bus driver. He said something to me, but I couldn&amp;#39;t hear him and just kept walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting off the tin can, I realized I forgot my traveler&amp;#39;s bag and I had to go back. I turn around to head towards the bus and just then the door morphs into a giant lion&amp;#39;s mouth. I gasp in terror and speed walk the opposite direction towards the baggage claim area. I start sweating and panting. My heart starts beating faster and faster and I begin to feel like the Plump Bambino I was sitting with earlier. I take a seat on the concrete and place my head between my knees hoping to channel this excess energy and fear. I sit there until the lion departs again for places unknown. I knew I lost my bag, lost my phone, my money and laptop but at that point, I didn&amp;#39;t care. I didn&amp;#39;t want anything to do with that bus, that driver or that blimp of a man any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that the mystery drug might be starting to wear off and my mind begins to remold itself. I looked at my watch and I had been sitting there for over an hour. I had no luggage, no clothes and no money. It started to really set in how f*cked I was and that I&amp;#39;d most likely never make it to Saint Louis. I started thinking about how I was going to make it back to my home in Spokane. I began questioning why I even left in the first place. I had a great job, a girlfriend and a home. My life was set, but I couldn&amp;#39;t bear to live the monotonous life that I was surely doomed to lead. So one day I just got up and left. Leaving everything behind but my phone, wallet, laptop and traveler&amp;#39;s bag, which were now on their way to some far off city in the complete opposite direction in which I&amp;#39;m heading, sitting next to the obese ham-man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to head away from the station when I notice two men in all black staring at me. I thought I saw them out of the corner of my eye while escaping the lion&amp;#39;s clutches but I figured they were just figments of my imagination. I have no protection and no way of letting someone know that I could potentially be in danger. I decide to stay near the station in case something happens. After walking out to the main road, I realize there&amp;#39;s nothing in sight for miles either way. I look behind me as I walk back to the station door and the men were still standing and staring. I go in to speak to the ticket clerk to see if they&amp;#39;d perhaps let me use their phone to call my girlfriend. I walk up to the woman at the desk and that&amp;#39;s when round two of this mystery drug kicks in. I see the woman staring back at me, her hair white and thin, her teeth chipped and green. I can smell her perfume and it begins to resonate in my nostrils getting stronger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mumble to her without being able to control the volume of my voice, &amp;quot;Phone...call!... PLEASE&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She yells back &amp;quot;PAYING CUSTOMERS ONLY!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In shock, I turn around and feel the whole world collapse bellow me. Just three words turned me into a crying, sniffling, babbling waste of a human being. I begin to crawl to the outside chairs to maybe find a cigarette butt to puff on or maybe a drinking fountain to lean on. I just need something to bring me back to reality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like three and a half days, I make it to a chair on the outside of the station to collect my thoughts and smoke on cigarette butts. I smoke four or five ends of cigarettes until I feel like I can come to grips with everything. I have a deep internal battle as to what to do, but agreed with myself that I&amp;#39;ll be useless until the following day. What this means now is that I&amp;#39;ll be sleeping somewhere near this god forsaken station and I&amp;#39;ll need to make friends with the land and its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the corner of my eye, I see the two men again. I figured they got bored waiting for me to drag my lifeless body out of the station and away from the green-toothed monster behind the desk, but they were still there! Both not moving a muscle, just staring. I can&amp;#39;t recognize any distinguishable traits or physical characteristics about them. Just two men in all black, standing from a distance with their eyes on me. My heart begins to pound again and at this point, I feel like I WILL be having a heart attack and dying before these men get to have their way with me. Whatever way that was, I wanted no part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see one man reach behind his back, look over to his partner and show him what looked to be a very large knife with an even larger jagged edge. A fine piece of cutlery that looked like it would slash through my bones like a knife through butter. Tears started swelling up in my eyes blurring my vision. I start shaking uncontrollably and breathing even heavier than before. My head begins to pound as I realize that I&amp;#39;m going to die a very slow and painful death at the hands of two anonymous men in all black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who the f*ck are these people?! Why are they staring at ME? What did I do to them?! I came in minding my own business, meaning no harm to anyone but myself. Why can&amp;#39;t they accept that and leave me alone? I don&amp;#39;t want any problems. They don&amp;#39;t understand? Oh god they&amp;#39;re walking closer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look around for something to protect myself with. A rock, a stick, anything that&amp;#39;ll prevent me from me from the nice long cutting they&amp;#39;re going to give me and then suddenly I see it... Like a gift from God herself, a payphone! I stumble over to it as calmly as possible which probably looked like a paraplegic learning how to breakdance to these two men, but I had to make moves and get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took what seemed like another 7 or 8 hours to get to the phone booth, but once there I knew exactly who to call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you for calling 911 sir, what is your emergency?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scream &amp;quot;HELP ME!!! My name is Frank, my social security number is 658-89-4579 and I am going to die soon! There are these men here man.... They&amp;#39;re going to get me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok sir can you tell me a little more about these men?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m at the train station! Come quick!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sir I know where you are. Why are these men going to injure you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lord Jesus I don&amp;#39;t know! They gave me these looks then brandished a knife! It&amp;#39;s cause of the fat man, I swear it is&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The fat man sir?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The FAT MAN IN THE TIN CAN WOMAN! Do you not speak English?!? Send some of your finest officers over RIGHT AWAY!.... These men mean business&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok sir, please stay on the phone with me while I dispatch a police officer&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God damn it OK!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear her clickety clacking on her keyboard while the men move closer and closer at a snail&amp;#39;s pace. I wish something would just HAPPEN already! I want to die or be saved, either way, I don&amp;#39;t care at this point. My mind is going to explode with anxiety, frustration and general fear. I need something to happen now. I start wishing for my death to be over with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please... please...please just kill me already&amp;quot; I think to myself &amp;quot;Put me out of my misery!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman on the pay phone chimes in, &amp;quot;Sir?..... Sir are you there?... Sir someone should be out there in less than 5 minutes... SIR?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;WHAT WOMAN?! WHAT DO YOU WANT?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sir I&amp;#39;ve dispatched a cruiser, they should be there shortly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well it&amp;#39;s about time! Thank YOU!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slam the phone down and immediately see the pigs she dispatched... At this point in time I think about the situation I&amp;#39;m in and how odd it&amp;#39;s going to sound to these sober law enforcers. All the questions they&amp;#39;re going to ask about myself, where I&amp;#39;m from, where I&amp;#39;m going and why I&amp;#39;m holding on to a phone booth tighter than Rose and the door at the end of Titanic. I thought and I thought and I thought some more and I decided it was time to go back in a face the green toothed, silver-headed monster at the ticket counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk in with haste this time to avoid the cops seeing me. I stand near the door, away from the woman but still able to see the two men and the police cruiser. The two officers park behind the two men still walking towards the station and pull out their service revolvers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear them yell to the men, &amp;quot;GET DOWN ON THE GROUND!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They repeat &amp;quot;WE SAID GET DOWN ON THE GRAND AND REVEIL THE WEAPON YOU HAVE ON YOUR PERSON!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, they run in and tackle the two men down to the ground. I witness all this from inside of the station, curled up and around the doors and windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Christ Almighty!&amp;quot; I think to myself &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve gotten ourselves into some deep deep sh!t this time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run to the bathroom, avoiding the evil bag of bones at the desk. I had to clean myself up and look respectable before these pigs come in here and ask me 21 f***king questions. I look in the mirror and actually SEE myself for the first time that day... I see myself for who I am, I see myself as others see me and I see myself as how I&amp;#39;d like to be. I&amp;#39;m a mess. I have dirt and dust all over my clothes. Spit and snot running all over the collar of my shirt. I feel just as gross as the fat man and the ticket woman combined..... I started thinking harder and harder about my situation realizing what really is happening here. All of these people were myself. The ham man that showed up on the bus was showing me how unhappy I was with my life. Gluttonous and fat, consuming as much as I could. Drinking, eating, drinking and eating some more.... The woman behind the ticket desk, mean and evil showing myself how I really thought about other people in disgust without knowing them. The prejudgment, the ignorance. I was she and she was I, and the two men.... The two men were me realizing how much of a waste I have become. Proving that I didn&amp;#39;t care if I lived or died. I didn&amp;#39;t care who would be affected by my actions. I just wanted what I wanted when I wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police officers came in to the bathroom after the nice old lady at the ticket desk let them know that there was a screaming belligerent fool at her station for hours on end. I was the one she called the cops on.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"This story took place one winter during my final year on patrol in the Arctic Ocean. There were around sixty of us on that ship that night, mostly military personnel. 

A cold wind blew in as the sun sank beneath the horizon. It illuminated one side of our ship for some time until at last, it was completely gone. The night air was frigid, so I was grateful to be inside. Faint chatter could be heard from above in the bridge, but I mostly ignored it. My quarters were down below. I was thankful to have one small porthole window on the side of my room, but that was about it. 

My room wasn't the most decorated, but it was comfortable. I had my old laptop sitting on the wooden desk. The carpet was a moldy green color. And a springy, but somewhat comfortable bed. I glanced at my watch, it was nearly time for my shift. I sighed and groggily climbed the steel ladder onto the bridge. ""Captain Grant,"" I said with a salute. 

""A fine night, isn't it?"" he replied.

""Cold, Sir.""

""Yes, I suppose it is,"" he said with a chuckle, extinguishing his cigarette into a nearby ashtray. ""I think I'm going to be heading off now. It's been a long day. We should be at the harbor in a few days. 

""I like the sound of that,"" I said with a smile. To be quite honest, I was tired of being out at sea and longing for home. Though, I'm sure everyone was. A few of the staff remained on the lower decks, but I sat in the bridge staring at my watch. Time seemed to move slower whenever I did that, so I tried to avoid that. The entire ocean was dark, aside from the dim lights on the ship. There didn't appear to be a moon out, only a starlit sky. 

""Everyone has to do it I suppose,"" said Officer Edward, who was approaching from behind. ""Watch duty, I mean. Grant is gettin' too old for this. Is this your first time?""

""Yeah,"" I managed to stifle out.

""Ah, well, I remember mine as well. You'll be fine so long as you ignore anything you might see or hear from outside the ship.""

""What?"" I chuckled. ""We're in the middle of the ocean.""

""Musta' just been the new recruits stirring drama then. I've heard reports lately of strange sights and sounds. Maybe even seen them myself. Let's just be grateful we're going back to port in two days, assuming we are making full speed.""

""Wouldn't that be nice? I must say, I--"" An extremely loud boom interrupted my voice. Sweat dripped down my face as I felt my heart thump rapidly. ""What the fuck was that?"" Officer Edward's face went paler than a ghost as he ran out of the bridge.

""I... I don't know. Wake the Captain, NOW!"" he shouted, turning around quickly. The officers who were awake below were stirring, along with the recruits. I ran down the hall through the back of the bridge to find the captain was already awake. 

""Captain, Sir,"" I began to say, but he just walked past me, giving me no more than an estranged glance. His eyes appeared glazed over and he walked silently. Edward had no success reaching him either. Eventually, the Captain just walked down the stairs into the bowels of the ship. I ran over to Edward as fast as I could. A few other crew members were standing there. ""What's the damage?""

""I... I'm not sure... This has... Never happened before. You don't... You don't think we're... Going down, do you?""

""I hope not. Nobody is around for hundreds of miles.""

""Peterson has already sent out a signal.""

""Good.""

""Sir, the ammunition supply has exploded. D-Deck is ablaze!"" a private shouted towards us.

""Come, It's too hectic up here,"" said Edward, leading me down below. We arrived at the lounge to find it empty. ""Cards?"" he said. I nodded. At least it would be a nice distraction. ""I trust the captain will handle this.""

""Are you kidding? He seems dazed.""

""As I said, Grant's too old for this.""

""Well, I suspect the damage isn't too serious. We are already heading back.""

""Listen to me,"" Edward eyed me closely. ""Whatever you do, don't go into the water. Not only is it below freezing, but there's also...""

""Also what?""

""Just don't. I can't even explain it, but we've lost people in these waters before."" I felt my heart begin thumping again. ""I didn't mean to scare you,"" he said with a chuckle. ""A repair boat will fix us up in a few hours and we'll be back home. I swear, this year I'm gonna quit the service. I haven't seen m' wife in months.""

""Tell me about it. I just want to go back home. The service isn't for me. At least, not here. We are in a time of peace anyway, not sure why we need to be all the way up in this freezing waste.""

""Eh, it's nothing. Been out here a few years and you know everything. I've been around the block many times. Seldom do recruits every stay here, and from what you're telling me, you're no different. Don't be alarmed though, we've had fires before,"" he began to chuckle raspily when he stopped and his face went white again. He glanced down. I glanced down. There was a thin layer of water seeping in from under the door.

The lights flickered, to the point where I thought they'd go out. Miraculously, they lit back up again. The entire hallway was covered in about a foot of water. ""Damnit!"" Edward sputtered. ""You stay here, I'll go find Peterson."" Before I could argue, he was already down the hall. The water grew higher. I felt a sense of dread as I gazed down the hall. *What if he doesn't return in time?*

After waiting for a few minutes, I eventually returned to the bridge. At least there it was dry. Though, the slow panic returned as I watched the steel bow slowly dip closer and closer down into the water. Eventually, the cold seawater began flowing over the sides, pulling our cruiser deeper down into the water. 

A few of the officers fired flare guns. They lit the sky up for a brief moment and released a thunderous boom. Yet there was no reply. I glanced back down the hall, looking for any sign of Edward. I still saw nothing. C-Deck had to have completely flooded by then, so I figured he was somewhere else. 

When Captain Grant came walking back up onto the bridge, I quickly left. His eyes were still glazed over and he didn't appear to even notice me. His face was pale and all he had was a gaping look of horror strewn across his face. The bow had completely gone under, and I could feel us going down quicker than before. 

The only sound, aside from the screams and splashes of water, was the sound of the steel ship creaking and roaring. The Captain must've turned on his radio because old-timey music began to play from the bridge. Eventually, the water began pouring over the sides of the top deck and into the bridge. My heart beat faster and faster as I saw the water creep closer and closer. Most of the crew were now swimming and screaming. A lot of the recruits were there as well, trying to find anything to float on. The stern was sinking from behind as well. A few steel seams tore open, sucking whoever was unfortunate enough to be swimming above, down into the bowels of the ship, never to see the light of day again. 

A few crew members were wrestling with one of the inflatable rafts. A lot of them had sunk, but this one they had finally been able to get open. Officer Breg and a few recruits were sitting on it as well. We all began rowing away as the last of the steel cruiser disappeared beneath the waters, taking everyone still aboard down with it. I felt myself being pulled down by the cruiser. I wrestled with the current until finally, I found myself gasping on the surface, surrounded by a few dozen other people all doing the same. Everyone was swimming towards that one raft, but they were rowing away. 

I swam over to it, fortunate to be the closest. ""He'll drown us!"" one of the men aboard shouted. The water was so cold I could hardly speak, but I think I managed to let out a gaping plea. The next thing I knew, Officer Breg was pulling me overboard. I was worried that the others would swamp us, but they were still far away.

Just before the lights went out on the soon to disappear ship, I could've sworn I saw Edward. Standing in the window of one of the portholes. Smiling at me. The ship was completely submerged, but I could still see it briefly. He was gone completely when the power cut. *That's... That's not possible.* I thought to myself. ""ROW!"" shouted Officer Breg from behind. There were still a bunch of people treading in the water. That was until it started. With the ocean pitch black, it was impossible to see much. But I did see some unseen force pulling the people down. Was it the suction of the ship or something more? That I cannot say. 

It only took a few minutes before the shouting had ceased and the ocean was eerily calm. Nobody was moving or speaking anymore, and Officer Breg ordered everyone to shut their mouths. I spent the next few hours in the worst terror I could have imagined, unable to sleep at all. When the first light of dawn arose, I knew we'd made it through the night. I carefully peered down into the water for a glance at anything, but I saw nothing other than inky black shapes swimming in the dark depths below. I didn't dare allow my mind to wander on what they were. 

I glanced around the boat. We were alone in the middle of the ocean, one orange raft, aside from a few distant icebergs. There wasn't a trace of anyone in the water. Not a single person or piece of drifting material, aside from our raft. Officer Breg held his revolver all night and still clutched it the following morning. He finally loosened his grip when we all heard the sound of a helicopter in the distance. We all cried tears of relief until we felt the raft begin to be pulled down by the same unseen force. Breg's face immediately went from relief to fear. He grabbed his revolver and began shooting into the water.

The helicopter's ladder had hit the raft, which was now filling with water. A few men had already begun climbing it, while Breg aimed his revolver down at the water. ""Bastards!"" he shouted. I climbed onto the ladder and began ascending. Breg was the last one onto the ladder. The entire raft sank just as he jumped off. We couldn't climb faster. They began rolling the ladder back up. I glanced down to see a long, gnarled, black arm reach up out of the water. The skin almost looked burnt, with long nails. It came within an inch of Breg's foot before he blew it open with his revolver. The hand quickly went back down into the water. I couldn't see what it was attached to, nor did I want to.

None of us felt safe until the helicopter landed onto a carrier. Within a few days, we were able to make it back to shore. I left the service soon after and decided to return home. Nobody ever found the wreckage of our cruiser, nor was anyone ever recovered, but I do know that they no longer send patrols in that one stretch of land anymore and for good reason. I now live landlocked, and I hate the sight of water that I can't see the bottom of, even lakes.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I... I don&amp;#39;t know. Wake the Captain, NOW!&amp;quot; he shouted, turning around quickly. The officers who were awake below were stirring, along with the recruits. I ran down the hall through the back of the bridge to find the captain was already awake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Captain, Sir,&amp;quot; I began to say, but he just walked past me, giving me no more than an estranged glance. His eyes appeared glazed over and he walked silently. Edward had no success reaching him either. Eventually, the Captain just walked down the stairs into the bowels of the ship. I ran over to Edward as fast as I could. A few other crew members were standing there. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the damage?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I... I&amp;#39;m not sure... This has... Never happened before. You don&amp;#39;t... You don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re... Going down, do you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope not. Nobody is around for hundreds of miles.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Peterson has already sent out a signal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sir, the ammunition supply has exploded. D-Deck is ablaze!&amp;quot; a private shouted towards us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come, It&amp;#39;s too hectic up here,&amp;quot; said Edward, leading me down below. We arrived at the lounge to find it empty. &amp;quot;Cards?&amp;quot; he said. I nodded. At least it would be a nice distraction. &amp;quot;I trust the captain will handle this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you kidding? He seems dazed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As I said, Grant&amp;#39;s too old for this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, I suspect the damage isn&amp;#39;t too serious. We are already heading back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Listen to me,&amp;quot; Edward eyed me closely. &amp;quot;Whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t go into the water. Not only is it below freezing, but there&amp;#39;s also...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Also what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just don&amp;#39;t. I can&amp;#39;t even explain it, but we&amp;#39;ve lost people in these waters before.&amp;quot; I felt my heart begin thumping again. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t mean to scare you,&amp;quot; he said with a chuckle. &amp;quot;A repair boat will fix us up in a few hours and we&amp;#39;ll be back home. I swear, this year I&amp;#39;m gonna quit the service. I haven&amp;#39;t seen m&amp;#39; wife in months.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it. I just want to go back home. The service isn&amp;#39;t for me. At least, not here. We are in a time of peace anyway, not sure why we need to be all the way up in this freezing waste.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Eh, it&amp;#39;s nothing. Been out here a few years and you know everything. I&amp;#39;ve been around the block many times. Seldom do recruits every stay here, and from what you&amp;#39;re telling me, you&amp;#39;re no different. Don&amp;#39;t be alarmed though, we&amp;#39;ve had fires before,&amp;quot; he began to chuckle raspily when he stopped and his face went white again. He glanced down. I glanced down. There was a thin layer of water seeping in from under the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lights flickered, to the point where I thought they&amp;#39;d go out. Miraculously, they lit back up again. The entire hallway was covered in about a foot of water. &amp;quot;Damnit!&amp;quot; Edward sputtered. &amp;quot;You stay here, I&amp;#39;ll go find Peterson.&amp;quot; Before I could argue, he was already down the hall. The water grew higher. I felt a sense of dread as I gazed down the hall. &lt;em&gt;What if he doesn&amp;#39;t return in time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waiting for a few minutes, I eventually returned to the bridge. At least there it was dry. Though, the slow panic returned as I watched the steel bow slowly dip closer and closer down into the water. Eventually, the cold seawater began flowing over the sides, pulling our cruiser deeper down into the water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the officers fired flare guns. They lit the sky up for a brief moment and released a thunderous boom. Yet there was no reply. I glanced back down the hall, looking for any sign of Edward. I still saw nothing. C-Deck had to have completely flooded by then, so I figured he was somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Captain Grant came walking back up onto the bridge, I quickly left. His eyes were still glazed over and he didn&amp;#39;t appear to even notice me. His face was pale and all he had was a gaping look of horror strewn across his face. The bow had completely gone under, and I could feel us going down quicker than before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only sound, aside from the screams and splashes of water, was the sound of the steel ship creaking and roaring. The Captain must&amp;#39;ve turned on his radio because old-timey music began to play from the bridge. Eventually, the water began pouring over the sides of the top deck and into the bridge. My heart beat faster and faster as I saw the water creep closer and closer. Most of the crew were now swimming and screaming. A lot of the recruits were there as well, trying to find anything to float on. The stern was sinking from behind as well. A few steel seams tore open, sucking whoever was unfortunate enough to be swimming above, down into the bowels of the ship, never to see the light of day again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few crew members were wrestling with one of the inflatable rafts. A lot of them had sunk, but this one they had finally been able to get open. Officer Breg and a few recruits were sitting on it as well. We all began rowing away as the last of the steel cruiser disappeared beneath the waters, taking everyone still aboard down with it. I felt myself being pulled down by the cruiser. I wrestled with the current until finally, I found myself gasping on the surface, surrounded by a few dozen other people all doing the same. Everyone was swimming towards that one raft, but they were rowing away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swam over to it, fortunate to be the closest. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;ll drown us!&amp;quot; one of the men aboard shouted. The water was so cold I could hardly speak, but I think I managed to let out a gaping plea. The next thing I knew, Officer Breg was pulling me overboard. I was worried that the others would swamp us, but they were still far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before the lights went out on the soon to disappear ship, I could&amp;#39;ve sworn I saw Edward. Standing in the window of one of the portholes. Smiling at me. The ship was completely submerged, but I could still see it briefly. He was gone completely when the power cut. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;#39;s... That&amp;#39;s not possible.&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself. &amp;quot;ROW!&amp;quot; shouted Officer Breg from behind. There were still a bunch of people treading in the water. That was until it started. With the ocean pitch black, it was impossible to see much. But I did see some unseen force pulling the people down. Was it the suction of the ship or something more? That I cannot say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took a few minutes before the shouting had ceased and the ocean was eerily calm. Nobody was moving or speaking anymore, and Officer Breg ordered everyone to shut their mouths. I spent the next few hours in the worst terror I could have imagined, unable to sleep at all. When the first light of dawn arose, I knew we&amp;#39;d made it through the night. I carefully peered down into the water for a glance at anything, but I saw nothing other than inky black shapes swimming in the dark depths below. I didn&amp;#39;t dare allow my mind to wander on what they were. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glanced around the boat. We were alone in the middle of the ocean, one orange raft, aside from a few distant icebergs. There wasn&amp;#39;t a trace of anyone in the water. Not a single person or piece of drifting material, aside from our raft. Officer Breg held his revolver all night and still clutched it the following morning. He finally loosened his grip when we all heard the sound of a helicopter in the distance. We all cried tears of relief until we felt the raft begin to be pulled down by the same unseen force. Breg&amp;#39;s face immediately went from relief to fear. He grabbed his revolver and began shooting into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The helicopter&amp;#39;s ladder had hit the raft, which was now filling with water. A few men had already begun climbing it, while Breg aimed his revolver down at the water. &amp;quot;Bastards!&amp;quot; he shouted. I climbed onto the ladder and began ascending. Breg was the last one onto the ladder. The entire raft sank just as he jumped off. We couldn&amp;#39;t climb faster. They began rolling the ladder back up. I glanced down to see a long, gnarled, black arm reach up out of the water. The skin almost looked burnt, with long nails. It came within an inch of Breg&amp;#39;s foot before he blew it open with his revolver. The hand quickly went back down into the water. I couldn&amp;#39;t see what it was attached to, nor did I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us felt safe until the helicopter landed onto a carrier. Within a few days, we were able to make it back to shore. I left the service soon after and decided to return home. Nobody ever found the wreckage of our cruiser, nor was anyone ever recovered, but I do know that they no longer send patrols in that one stretch of land anymore and for good reason. I now live landlocked, and I hate the sight of water that I can&amp;#39;t see the bottom of, even lakes. Beware what lies beneath the depths unseen.&lt;/p&gt;

By the turn of the millenium, the paper industry around Kalamazoo, Michigan was a wasteland of gigantic buildings, superfund sites, and rough neighborhoods. Even a small paper mill employs a few thousand people, and the area had lost seven of them in the past few decades. Every one of the “Seven Sisters” had died with a whisper. If it wasn’t for the university, the town would have dried up entirely. As it was, most of the area, and especially the smaller towns, were hanging by a thread. The city motto should be “Kalamazoo, a great place to be from!”

The mammoth GPI paper mill was less than a quarter mile from our workshop and had been sitting abandoned for years. Thanks to some local support we got permission to “Take anything but the paint” provided we could haul it out within a two-week window before the demolition crew began their work. We literally signed our lives away on release forms, and the security guard shook his head and smiled when he gave us a key. For half a month we backed up a twenty-foot long aging box truck with a questionable transmission, and sucked the marrow from the dying bones of industry to feed our little community makerspace.

We had a blast. For a team of young nerds and engineers this was like Mardi-Gras and Christmas combined. We explored every inch of the half-mile-long building and filled our truck dozens of times over with shelving, valves, Allen Bradley switchgear, metal stock, and tooling that dated back several wars. Most of it would have been worthless to the scrap companies, but to us it was treasure that would become parts for some of our most famous projects for the next fifteen years.

Anything of real value had already been stripped out. The giant machines had all been sold at auctions years ago. The meth-heads took most of what was left, stripping the wire from the walls. Every conduit was empty, pigtails only a few inches long left hanging out. Tens of thousands of dollars in copper, all to feed someone’s addiction.

The facility was a cavernous, post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s the kind of place they use for movie sets and photography shoots. There were jagged pipes and conduits, razor sharp and jutting out at odd angles. There were holes large enough to drop a city bus through that went down three floors, where gigantic paper machines once sat. The entire place was festooned with “ankle-breakers”, sets of four bolts, sticking up from the concrete floor where some control stand or grinder or something was once bolted down, waiting for the next person who didn’t pay very close attention where they stepped.

In a world where everyone has turned into a pussy, with people making careers out of being offended on the behalf of other people, and with lawyers having worked with insurance companies to take all of the good honest fun out of getting your hands dirty and doing something dangerous, this was heaven for a twenty-something country boy. My weirdo friends and I were having the time of our lives.
We wandered,shopped, and explored for a week before we noticed it. I was fifteen feet in the air, trying to unbolt an old electric fire alarm horn from a steel beam, and just by chance  happened to glance to my left. There, nestled in between a pair of I-beams, was what looked like three large 4-inch pipes. Only the ribbed texture gave it away. I rubbed a small spot, taking fifty years of paper dust and pigeon shit off with my thumb, and showing a beautiful, faded, red jacket underneath.

It wasn't a pipe; it was a cable. It was gigantic cable! It was copper cable. I followed its path and saw that it went up to the very top of the ceiling, across the roof struts of the main gallery, down the other side and vanished through the floor. The room that I was in was forty-feet high, and it was easily two-hundred feet across the gallery.

The only reason this was still there was because it was so well hidden, tucked away in the beams and camouflaged in the grunge. The meth-head scrappers were so caught up in the half-inch and other small EMT conduits they’d never thought to look for the main power feeds that supplied whole sections of the plant.

The problem was, how in the hell were we going to get it down? This stuff weighs about fifteen-pounds to the foot. It’s thicker than my arm, and comprised of three stranded cables, each over an inch thick, entwined in padding and insulation, and all wrapped in a metallic shell with a red plastic outer jacket. It’s tough, heavy, and worth several dollars a pound...

...that is if you can move it, if you can cut it, and if you can get it out of the ceiling without killing yourself.

I got on my radio and the whole team assembled. We all had a quiet freakout when the team realized the gravity of our discovery, and also how hard it would be to get it out of there. Certainly, this was a great place to have to push, pull, lift, and haul tons of materials at once. The problem was that none of the old material-handling equipment was there anymore, and we didn’t have any kind of power to use tools as it was. The building was a long dead carcass at this point, and we were the absolute last team that would be in there before giant machines turned the whole place into tidy piles of steel, concrete, stainless, and glass.

We needed a plan, and one that would work on human power. 

We all headed back to the lab and assembled every harness, rope, comealong, and sling we could find. I pulled out my climbing bags and non-industrial harnesses as well. The next morning we all met at the lab, and then headed over to “Site-T” as we had come to call it. Now, we had a whole new mission.

This old abandoned building was about to become fundraising for our little nonprofit and help us keep the heat on all winter.

We set to work with slings and come-alongs. A come-along (pronounced without the hyphen and in three smashed together syllables while holding a Vernor’s and smoking a Camel), is a lever-actuated ratchet and pawl winch. Smaller ones have a piece of aircraft cable that winds around a drum, and larger ones use a chain and cog mechanism that can let an average man rip a tree out of the ground. They’re small, portable, don’t require electricity or gasoline, and are incredibly powerful. They’re also dangerous as hell if you don’t know what you’re doing. If an attachment slips, if you overload one, or if anything lets go they can slingshot the tail and that piece of aircraft cable moving at Mach speed will slice you to the bone before you even know you’re bleeding.

Stupid hurts and scars carry lessons.

The cables ran in a metal tray for most of their length. The tray was steel, and looked like a ladder with flat rungs. Like everything else in the whole place, it was covered in eighty-years of paper dust that formed a hard, grey shell on everything. The parts up in the main gallery had an extra layer of pigeon shit, just for flavour.

It was slow work with hacksaws and flashlights. A single piece, about three-feet-long was about as much as you wanted to carry at one time if you had to walk any real distance. In most cases, it was about a 2-city-block walk back to the truck. So we worked in teams, some cutting, and most hauling. It was filthy, grueling, exhausting work that went on for days.

After getting all of the low-hanging fruit, it was time to get the main runs down from the ceiling. We’d cut the ends back at the switchgear cabinets free as high as we could reach while standing on the cabinets. But that still left about twenty feet of cables hanging from the ceiling. From there they ran all the way across the gallery and down the other side. They went through a hole in each floor with a bunch of other pipes and conduits. At the bottom they made a bend in the lowest floor, a sub-basement about seventy feet down from the top of the run up in the roof. The bottom run was suspended in a tray along the ceiling of the basement and ran through the maze of pipes that fed the old mill.

We’d gotten everything we could easily reach, and now it was time for the hard stuff.

With a hodgepodge of slings tied to everything we could reach that was solidly bolted down, we hooked up to just one of the three cables. The plan was to pull them out, one at a time, and let them just pile up on the floor. We’d cut it, haul it, and then pull the next one down. The only thing left holding the cables in place at this point was gravity, but there was a hell of a lot of gravity in one of these cables.

There was also, we learned quickly, a lot of stretch. 

We were spread out along the length of the run. A small group was working the winches in the basement, the rest were stationed in ones and twos strung from hell to breakfast. We all had our radios and were in communication, but for the most part it was a nearly silent process that involved a lot of standing around and smoking a cigarette while watching nothing much happen.

I was up in the ceiling, sitting on a pair of old steam pipes that ran parallel to the cable tray. I was at the top level, about ten feet from the last bend where they dropped down to terminate at the switchgear cabinets. My job was simple, report when it started to move. Once the end of the cable passed by me, my job was to inch along with it and give progress reports. We knew it would take hours to pull it out of there. I got comfortable and listened to the cable tick quietly as they slowly worked the ratchet a quarter-mile away from me.

The basement team worked slowly, a synchronized team all working their levers together in time. I could hear the sound of them ratcheting their come-alongs as it echoed up from the depths of the mill across the cavernous gallery where I sat.

The quiet of the mill was awesome. Every few seconds I would hear the cable tick off in the distance ahead of me. They were pulling on the far end, and ever so slowly they were putting more and more tension on the cable. By now it was easily several thousand pounds at the far end. It was fascinating to realise that something so big, so heavy, could actually stretch. Their end had already moved by a few feet, while mine sat perfectly still.

Then suddenly…..BRRRRRT! The cable moved about six inches and I nearly pissed myself. It was loud, damn loud, and I startled out of my daydreaming when the whole tray made the sound as the ribbed surface of the cable dragged over the rungs in the tray. A dozen pigeons took flight from the rafters and either went out the smashed windows near the ceiling or did laps around the gallery before picking a new spot to sit. It sent a shower of dust and birdshit raining down on the gallery, falling into the giant holes below and settling into the darkness. 

The radio cracked to life as everyone checked in. We were all fine, but we all had a healthy dose of fear. We knew we’d awoken a sleeping Giant, and we all had a serious respect for the dangerous combination of energy, weight, and heights we were working with. This was especially true for my dumb ass perched up in the rafters sitting only a few feet from the Giant’s tail.

The dust settled and the silence was again broken by the ratcheting off in the depths of the mill and the rhythmic ticking of the cable. Every thirty seconds or so the tension would release as the cable shifted with a BRRRRRRRT and moved along another six inches.

This was going to take a while.

I got comfortable, I enjoyed the view from my perch and passed the time smoking cigarettes and keeping track of the slow climb of the end of the cable. Over the next hour the pattern of the ticks and the BRRRRTs had stayed pretty constant and while progress was slow, it was consistent.

After an hour or two, the pattern started to change, and that got my attention. The cable went BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT for a solid ten seconds, which is a lifetime in that situation, and moved about two feet. 

My asshole did a fantastic impersonation of a rabbit’s nose.

This was a lot more than the six or eight inches we had been getting. I got on the radio and asked if everything was ok and everyone said they were fine. I told them about the development on my end, and everyone along the length had seen or heard it as it happened. We took this as good progress, and continued on.

Things started moving a lot faster now. We all woke up from our cable-pulling trance and focused. The Giant was stirring.

The cable started moving a few feet at a time, a few times a minute. The basement team kept pulling, and I could see the end just over the edge from the switchgear area. We’d moved the whole run almost twenty feet.

BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth 

That was different…...the cable moved about ten feet and I saw the end flop up and over the turn at the switchgear area. It was maybe five feet from my perch. The whole cable moved, and then shifted gears and slowed down to a crawl before stopping. Before it had just stopped.

You couldn't get a pin up my ass with a jackhammer. I heard the radio say “Look alive! Shit’s moving!” and I replied to the team with “Everyone be ready to run and find a shady spot”.

A minute later, it did it again, BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth and I watched the end drag on past me. I turned in my perch and debated following it along the pipes up here, or climbing down and watching from the slightly safer vantage point of the ground. See, up here, there was no way I could get out of the way. At least on the ground I could run. 

I was just off to the side of the pipes, standing on the unistrut racks over the switchgear cabinets with my head just under the cable tray when it happened.

BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

And that’s when the world exploded.

The cable didn’t slow down, it accelerated, quickly. The forces had reached their tipping point and there was a lot more gravity pulling down on the vertical run than there was friction from the long horizontal run. We had given it a gentle nudge of a few tons and once it had reached the tipping point, gravity took over. Several tons of cable was now in motion, turning potential into kinetic energy and building inertia. The fundamental forces of the universe were thrashing to come back into balance. It was like watching entropy have a bad acid trip.

I hugged the unistrut rack I was climbing on, being very aware of the vulnerability and openness of my current position and tried very hard not to piss down my leg. I mostly succeeded.

The sound was deafening. People always describe things like this as comparing them to a freight train. Fuck your freight train. I’ve stood next to a thousand freight trains over the years and none of them sounded even remotely like this. The ribbed conduit flew over the rungs in the cabletray and sounded like a thousand chainsaws competing in the Indy500 while being shelled with naval artillery. The loose end of the cable, now moving at highway speeds whipped into mounts and pipes and hangers and destroyed anything it touched, exploding into a rain of shrapnel and dust. The entire ceiling turned into a plume of birdshit and paper dust, and the building shook to its foundations as the cable made the corner from the rafters to the drop and flew from its vertical run to just land limp on the concrete floor in a gigantic pile.

The silence was even more deafening than the armageddon I had just experienced. The echos took half a minute to die out in the bowels of the old mill.

The radio went apeshit as a dozen people all tried to see how many of us had died. God had smiled on us, though some of us would have to change our shorts, nobody had so much as a scratch. A couple members of the team didn’t stop running until they were on the other end of the building, one even ran all the way outside and it was still falling after they made it out there.

It felt like we had slayed a Giant.  We all gathered at the Giant’s pile on the floor of the main gallery. There was a smaller pile in the basement, but the cable had bent and hung up here and dropped the majority of itself in a tangle. We were thankful for that, it saved having to haul it up a few flights of stairs. We all took a minute to just breathe, have a smoke, and let the adrenaline pass. None of us were expecting such an experience, but there wasn’t a person standing there who didn’t have a smile on their face.

We headed out for a couple hours, to get a quick shower, change our clothes, and grab something to eat. But every single one of us was back at the lab, ready to go shortly after. We went back to the old mill and repeated the experience, twice, by morning.

It took us days to get the piles cut to portable pieces. We got smart though, and learned we could haul them up to the door in fifty-foot lengths by dragging them as a team. Then we’d cut them up near the truck and just load them on.

The scrap value from all that cable paid the rent, kept the lights on, and fed the team for quite a while. The experience of nearly dying in the rafters of a paper mill though, that was priceless.

There, nestled in between a pair of I-beams, was what looked like three large 4-inch pipes. Only the ribbed texture gave it away. I rubbed a small spot, taking fifty years of paper dust and pigeon shit off with my thumb, and showing a beautiful, faded, red jacket underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a pipe; it was a cable. It was gigantic cable! It was copper cable. I followed its path and saw that it went up to the very top of the ceiling, across the roof struts of the main gallery, down the other side and vanished through the floor. The room that I was in was forty-feet high, and it was easily two-hundred feet across the gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason this was still there was because it was so well hidden, tucked away in the beams and camouflaged in the grunge. The meth-head scrappers were so caught up in the half-inch and other small EMT conduits they’d never thought to look for the main power feeds that supplied whole sections of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was, how in the hell were we going to get it down? This stuff weighs about fifteen-pounds to the foot. It’s thicker than my arm, and comprised of three stranded cables, each over an inch thick, entwined in padding and insulation, and all wrapped in a metallic shell with a red plastic outer jacket. It’s tough, heavy, and worth several dollars a pound...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...that is if you can move it, if you can cut it, and if you can get it out of the ceiling without killing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got on my radio and the whole team assembled. We all had a quiet freakout when the team realized the gravity of our discovery, and also how hard it would be to get it out of there. Certainly, this was a great place to have to push, pull, lift, and haul tons of materials at once. The problem was that none of the old material-handling equipment was there anymore, and we didn’t have any kind of power to use tools as it was. The building was a long dead carcass at this point, and we were the absolute last team that would be in there before giant machines turned the whole place into tidy piles of steel, concrete, stainless, and glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed a plan, and one that would work on human power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all headed back to the lab and assembled every harness, rope, comealong, and sling we could find. I pulled out my climbing bags and non-industrial harnesses as well. The next morning we all met at the lab, and then headed over to “Site-T” as we had come to call it. Now, we had a whole new mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This old abandoned building was about to become fundraising for our little nonprofit and help us keep the heat on all winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set to work with slings and come-alongs. A come-along (pronounced without the hyphen and in three smashed together syllables while holding a Vernor’s and smoking a Camel), is a lever-actuated ratchet and pawl winch. Smaller ones have a piece of aircraft cable that winds around a drum, and larger ones use a chain and cog mechanism that can let an average man rip a tree out of the ground. They’re small, portable, don’t require electricity or gasoline, and are incredibly powerful. They’re also dangerous as hell if you don’t know what you’re doing. If an attachment slips, if you overload one, or if anything lets go they can slingshot the tail and that piece of aircraft cable moving at Mach speed will slice you to the bone before you even know you’re bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid hurts and scars carry lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cables ran in a metal tray for most of their length. The tray was steel, and looked like a ladder with flat rungs. Like everything else in the whole place, it was covered in eighty-years of paper dust that formed a hard, grey shell on everything. The parts up in the main gallery had an extra layer of pigeon shit, just for flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was slow work with hacksaws and flashlights. A single piece, about three-feet-long was about as much as you wanted to carry at one time if you had to walk any real distance. In most cases, it was about a 2-city-block walk back to the truck. So we worked in teams, some cutting, and most hauling. It was filthy, grueling, exhausting work that went on for days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting all of the low-hanging fruit, it was time to get the main runs down from the ceiling. We’d cut the ends back at the switchgear cabinets free as high as we could reach while standing on the cabinets. But that still left about twenty feet of cables hanging from the ceiling. From there they ran all the way across the gallery and down the other side. They went through a hole in each floor with a bunch of other pipes and conduits. At the bottom they made a bend in the lowest floor, a sub-basement about seventy feet down from the top of the run up in the roof. The bottom run was suspended in a tray along the ceiling of the basement and ran through the maze of pipes that fed the old mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d gotten everything we could easily reach, and now it was time for the hard stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a hodgepodge of slings tied to everything we could reach that was solidly bolted down, we hooked up to just one of the three cables. The plan was to pull them out, one at a time, and let them just pile up on the floor. We’d cut it, haul it, and then pull the next one down. The only thing left holding the cables in place at this point was gravity, but there was a hell of a lot of gravity in one of these cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also, we learned quickly, a lot of stretch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were spread out along the length of the run. A small group was working the winches in the basement, the rest were stationed in ones and twos strung from hell to breakfast. We all had our radios and were in communication, but for the most part it was a nearly silent process that involved a lot of standing around and smoking a cigarette while watching nothing much happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was up in the ceiling, sitting on a pair of old steam pipes that ran parallel to the cable tray. I was at the top level, about ten feet from the last bend where they dropped down to terminate at the switchgear cabinets. My job was simple, report when it started to move. Once the end of the cable passed by me, my job was to inch along with it and give progress reports. We knew it would take hours to pull it out of there. I got comfortable and listened to the cable tick quietly as they slowly worked the ratchet a quarter-mile away from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basement team worked slowly, a synchronized team all working their levers together in time. I could hear the sound of them ratcheting their come-alongs as it echoed up from the depths of the mill across the cavernous gallery where I sat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quiet of the mill was awesome. Every few seconds I would hear the cable tick off in the distance ahead of me. They were pulling on the far end, and ever so slowly they were putting more and more tension on the cable. By now it was easily several thousand pounds at the far end. It was fascinating to realise that something so big, so heavy, could actually stretch. Their end had already moved by a few feet, while mine sat perfectly still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly…..BRRRRRT! The cable moved about six inches and I nearly pissed myself. It was loud, damn loud, and I startled out of my daydreaming when the whole tray made the sound as the ribbed surface of the cable dragged over the rungs in the tray. A dozen pigeons took flight from the rafters and either went out the smashed windows near the ceiling or did laps around the gallery before picking a new spot to sit. It sent a shower of dust and birdshit raining down on the gallery, falling into the giant holes below and settling into the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio cracked to life as everyone checked in. We were all fine, but we all had a healthy dose of fear. We knew we’d awoken a sleeping Giant, and we all had a serious respect for the dangerous combination of energy, weight, and heights we were working with. This was especially true for my dumb ass perched up in the rafters sitting only a few feet from the Giant’s tail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dust settled and the silence was again broken by the ratcheting off in the depths of the mill and the rhythmic ticking of the cable. Every thirty seconds or so the tension would release as the cable shifted with a BRRRRRRRT and moved along another six inches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was going to take a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got comfortable, I enjoyed the view from my perch and passed the time smoking cigarettes and keeping track of the slow climb of the end of the cable. Over the next hour the pattern of the ticks and the BRRRRTs had stayed pretty constant and while progress was slow, it was consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour or two, the pattern started to change, and that got my attention. The cable went BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT for a solid ten seconds, which is a lifetime in that situation, and moved about two feet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My asshole did a fantastic impersonation of a rabbit’s nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a lot more than the six or eight inches we had been getting. I got on the radio and asked if everything was ok and everyone said they were fine. I told them about the development on my end, and everyone along the length had seen or heard it as it happened. We took this as good progress, and continued on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things started moving a lot faster now. We all woke up from our cable-pulling trance and focused. The Giant was stirring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cable started moving a few feet at a time, a few times a minute. The basement team kept pulling, and I could see the end just over the edge from the switchgear area. We’d moved the whole run almost twenty feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was different…...the cable moved about ten feet and I saw the end flop up and over the turn at the switchgear area. It was maybe five feet from my perch. The whole cable moved, and then shifted gears and slowed down to a crawl before stopping. Before it had just stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t get a pin up my ass with a jackhammer. I heard the radio say “Look alive! Shit’s moving!” and I replied to the team with “Everyone be ready to run and find a shady spot”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minute later, it did it again, BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth and I watched the end drag on past me. I turned in my perch and debated following it along the pipes up here, or climbing down and watching from the slightly safer vantage point of the ground. See, up here, there was no way I could get out of the way. At least on the ground I could run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just off to the side of the pipes, standing on the unistrut racks over the switchgear cabinets with my head just under the cable tray when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s when the world exploded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cable didn’t slow down, it accelerated, quickly. The forces had reached their tipping point and there was a lot more gravity pulling down on the vertical run than there was friction from the long horizontal run. We had given it a gentle nudge of a few tons and once it had reached the tipping point, gravity took over. Several tons of cable was now in motion, turning potential into kinetic energy and building inertia. The fundamental forces of the universe were thrashing to come back into balance. It was like watching entropy have a bad acid trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hugged the unistrut rack I was climbing on, being very aware of the vulnerability and openness of my current position and tried very hard not to piss down my leg. I mostly succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound was deafening. People always describe things like this as comparing them to a freight train. Fuck your freight train. I’ve stood next to a thousand freight trains over the years and none of them sounded even remotely like this. The ribbed conduit flew over the rungs in the cabletray and sounded like a thousand chainsaws competing in the Indy500 while being shelled with naval artillery. The loose end of the cable, now moving at highway speeds whipped into mounts and pipes and hangers and destroyed anything it touched, exploding into a rain of shrapnel and dust. The entire ceiling turned into a plume of birdshit and paper dust, and the building shook to its foundations as the cable made the corner from the rafters to the drop and flew from its vertical run to just land limp on the concrete floor in a gigantic pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silence was even more deafening than the armageddon I had just experienced. The echos took half a minute to die out in the bowels of the old mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio went apeshit as a dozen people all tried to see how many of us had died. God had smiled on us, though some of us would have to change our shorts, nobody had so much as a scratch. A couple members of the team didn’t stop running until they were on the other end of the building, one even ran all the way outside and it was still falling after they made it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt like we had slayed a Giant.  We all gathered at the Giant’s pile on the floor of the main gallery. There was a smaller pile in the basement, but the cable had bent and hung up here and dropped the majority of itself in a tangle. We were thankful for that, it saved having to haul it up a few flights of stairs. We all took a minute to just breathe, have a smoke, and let the adrenaline pass. None of us were expecting such an experience, but there wasn’t a person standing there who didn’t have a smile on their face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed out for a couple hours, to get a quick shower, change our clothes, and grab something to eat. But every single one of us was back at the lab, ready to go shortly after. We went back to the old mill and repeated the experience, twice, by morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took us days to get the piles cut to portable pieces. We got smart though, and learned we could haul them up to the door in fifty-foot lengths by dragging them as a team. Then we’d cut them up near the truck and just load them on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scrap value from all that cable paid the rent, kept the lights on, and fed the team for quite a while. The experience of nearly dying in the rafters of a paper mill though, that was priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy being happy in dangerous ways, and I can now say, I know what the end of the world sounds like.&lt;/p&gt;

I couldn't take my eyes off him for more than a moment.

I didn't understand why, he wasn't unattractive, but nothing about him could be considered striking. Yet, here I was, halfway across the bar, eyes returning to him time after time.

He was of average height, brown hair, the glimpses of his eyes suggesting hazel, and a look that said he wished the glass of amber liquid before him could soak up his sorrow. And me? I'm just an average girl, nothing special to look at. I had no illusions that I could capture his interest.

I began to mentally chide myself for foolishness, staring at a complete stranger at a bar. How cliché was I? Berating myself, I looked around, admitting there were men far more attractive present, and even a few that smiled in an encouraging, friendly way when they caught me looking. Even as those thoughts sank in, my eyes wandered back to the man at the end of the bar.

I noticed no one seemed to want to take the two stools closest to him, despite the busy night. You could almost feel the vibe from him, begging for space. I was torn between relief and annoyance when another regular approached him, drink in her hand, smile on her lips, and a bust line barely above illegally low. 

I looked down at my drink, frowning into the warm dregs of beer sitting at the bottom of my cup, telling myself to just square my tab and go home. Instead, I ordered a soda. I’d had enough to drink for the night, but wanted an excuse to stay a little longer. The server, while surprised at the deviation from my normal routine, brought my drink with her usual cheer before veering off to a table of rowdy young men ordering another round of shots. Finally, I looked back at the man, prepared to see him charmed and being wooed back to a love nest.

Instead, he was barely looking at her. He’d glance from time to time, but eyes always on her face, to her visible annoyance. She would reach out and touch him while talking, and while he didn’t shy away, he gave no reaction to her at all. I’d seen her work enough to know her side of the conversation from the movement of her bright lips.

“You just look so down, honey, are you sure you don’t want some company?”

The man just looked her in the eye, and seemed to confirm he was alright on his own.

With a touch of his bicep, “Maybe at least buy a lady a drink?”

Eyes drifting back to his own drink, his answer was invisible to me, but the effect on her was like a slap to the face. Her expression darkened, and she stood, nodding, before forcing the smile back to her lips. “Well, honey, if you change your mind, you may have to fight for what you turned down, I have no inclination to wait on a man.” She sashayed off, hips rolling, assets moving in ways I could only envy.

Relief coursing through me, I downed half my soda in one go, realizing suddenly I had been almost desperate to see her fail with this man. Suddenly embarrassed, I determined to finish my drink, pay my tab, and go home. I was apparently feeling lonelier than I thought, fixating on this poor man that appeared to want nothing to do with anyone.

When I raised my eyes once more, he was turned, looking at me, a faint smile on his lips. I felt the breath freeze in my chest, every inch of my body wanting to move closer to him, chiding myself all the while that I was a fool, and he likely was just amused by my strange antics, staring, chugging soda like a child, and probably smirking at the failure of the blonde bombshell.

I quickly finished my drink, looking desperately for my waitress, avoiding looking towards the man again. I created such a blind spot in my deliberation, I nearly jumped out of my chair when I heard him speak only feet away, “May I join you for a moment?”

I felt my head turn, as though drawn to look, independent of my brain’s desires. I felt myself nodding, although I had intended to tell him I was just leaving.

A smile blossomed on his face, transforming his whole appearance. There was the striking feature that would draw women like flies, some men as well, I’d wager. I felt my pulse quicken, the tides of my blood speeding, and smoothing away the jagged edges of anxiety. He sat smoothly opposite me, his half full glass still in hand.

“I know this sounds strange, but I feel drawn to you.”

I heard his words, but could not respond. It was the same sensation I’d had all night. This strange magnetism towards him. Without realizing I had intended to do so, I smiled, and told him that I understood, because I felt the same.

A brief flicker of something in his eyes before his reply, so faint I passed it off as a change in the lighting. “I think you’re the first girl that didn’t chide me for a shitty pick up line,” he chuckled, finishing his drink and setting the glass to the side.

I’m not sure how long we sat there, talking. I remember faintly touching on books, movies, trivia, all the trappings of the modern courtship initiation. It was only later I realized multiple empty water glasses were scattered over the table, I didn’t remember seeing the server, let alone asking for a beverage. I did hear the bartender’s announcement for last call, realizing with a jolt how long we’d conversed.

Sputtering an apology, I stood, signing the bill for my drinks I didn’t recall requesting. He smiled again, this time more gently, and asked if he could walk me to my car, with or without a bouncer, if I felt it was needed. Again, I felt the words drawn from me before I knew I was going to answer. I agreed, and told him the bouncer was not needed, even hearing myself giggle slightly as I did.

That was more than two weeks ago, apparently. I remember pieces of the time between in a haze. Feeling sick at work, only feeling like the vertigo would fade when I would see him again. It took two days for me to ask him to stay the night.

Don’t misunderstand, we haven’t slept together, not in the way you’d think. We’ve both just begun to notice a strange imbalance when separated. A strange sense of falling, or feeling out of alignment. As long as we’re close, everything feels fine.

We both managed to arrange some time off, then to work from my apartment for a while. My doctor is understanding about my anxiety, and put in a good word at my job. I’m not sure what he had to do, but given his contract work, it didn’t seem to require much for him to work from here.

It’s getting worse now. If we try to leave singly, even to go to the store for something as small as milk, it’s difficult to leave the apartment. At first I thought this to be emotional, an infatuation, but now I’m not so sure.

He cut his jaw shaving yesterday. When he went to get a styptic pencil from the pharmacy downstairs, I saw it. Three drops of blood hung in the air, slowly drifting towards me. Like I was a magnet, and it was filament. I felt a strange lurching when he made it to the elevators, and almost felt as though I would collapse, like whatever has been holding me up was being stripped from me.

Hello, I'm James and something happen earlier  on tonight leading to my inability open my curtains anymore...


To clarify I don't usually have my curtains open during the day anyway, I don't like the idea of people looking into my room, where I live. You know. Like some people are just too nosey.

Anyways, I live in a small English village, we have the essentials for all english villages: a church, pub, corner shop, village hall and a fish n chip shop. As well a primary school, park and a care home (that's only because we're a small village surrounded by smaller villages, separated by farmlands). I live directly across from the care home with my parents in an old council house. It's nice honestly. 

But you're not here to hear about the boring stuff like that...

You're here about the curtains... 

So, I was sat one night, about 1 am listening to pink floyd thinking about life, as you do, in my bed with my curtains slightly a draw watching the sideways rain rush by my window every few seconds, constantly being illuminated by the street light. I was doing this because the winds distracted me from, well doing nothing at all, but that's besides the point but it distracted me none the less. 

After a long while of watching the rain fall and vague grey outlines of tree tops swish from side to side, i found myself at my windowsill looking out onto the street watching the potholes in the road immediately fill and empty of water, because of the wind you see. This was the first time I've ever sat at night and looked out the window, so it was calming and almost magical to me.

That's when I saw them though. At first I was thrown back at the light grey, white silhouettes of people, because of the rain drops on the window I thought that maybe a few of the old people got out of the home and were wondering the lonely village roads, I mean it's happened before and dementia can make people do weird things. But there was something else to them, they moved too fast I guess you could say for an older person at least, I watched them walked on by my window up and down the road for... well it must have been about 10 minutes before one of them looked right at me, but it couldn't have seen me or for that fact even looked at me because where there should be a face there was nothing... ok not nothing but instead of a light grey like the rest of its body or you a face it was a darker grey but it was smudged like someone shaded over a face or tried to erase it. Anyway it was looking at me I guess, my reaction should have been to duck and hide but I didn't I just looked it right back in its smudgey none face, none  eerie none face. Nace? But the stare off didn't last long however, as it started walking towards my house up the driveway, moving like a zombie swaying its arms around and dragging one leg behind the other, still looking at me. At this moment I did duck and hide away from the window..

That's when the banging at the door started...

END.

,nosleep,"There's a being. A being that walks amongst the rain. Presumably cursed to forever be intangible and invisible until the rain comes. I first noticed it last month. I live in the middle of Philadelphia, in the middle of a typical American suburb. It was a Sunday afternoon. Nothing unusual, then the rain came down knocking on my window as it fell. It caught my attention and I looked outside onto the street below me.


What seemed like a child in an orange raincoat was stood slightly lopsided staring down into a dirty puddle that had formed by the sidewalk. I guess he was just staring at his reflection but the pure stillness of the puddle and the being made me inquisitive. It just stood there. I remember thinking ""what the f**k is that kid doing"". I lost interest pretty quickly, kids do weird s*it. I turned back to my computer, I didn't think anything of it. 


It rained again a week later. It was more of a storm that time. Thunder vibrated houses and rain drops smashed against glass. Sure enough the raincoat was back. Standing on the opposite side of the street seeminging to be almost staring into the soul of the puddle. At this point I got concerned. I was thinking maybe the kid had lost something or had some sort of mental issue and was having some paralysing fear reaction to a puddle. You never know. I opened the front door of my home and shouted across the street at them. 


""Hey kid, are you alright?"", I shouted over the roar of the rain. I regretted my naivety immediately. 


I saw the hood of the raincoat lift up. I could just about make out the figure. It looked as if a raincoat had been slung over what could only be described as the corpse of a mummified child. One leg was longer than the other. The arms just hung loosely at their side as if disconnected from their sockets. Most of the visible body was wrapped in damp bandages. The bandages that had come loose revealed a dark, rotten bone beneath them. The being had almost no facial features, the eyes, nose and mouth were mostly covered but the bits which were visible showed that what was once human was gone. 


The sounds of a high pitch cry could be heard within the barrage of the storm. I know it was them. 


The being got closer but I never saw it actually move a limb. It seemed to almost shimmer and glitch it's way through the rain without moving a finger. Of course I slammed my door and locked it. Every time it rained from then, the raincoat would either be at my front door or stood in the garden or on the sidewalk outside my house. Never making a sound. Just. Waiting. 


I tried to tell people. I tried to video it and take pictures. It would show up in pictures but only I could see it. It's dead face staring at me through the rain. I tried to prove I wasn't insane. It never showed up when other people were around. Everyone thinks I've 'had an episode' or 'developed ombrophobia'. I know I'm not crazy. It torments me on purpose. 


I put a deposit down on a small shi**y apartment that day and I'm supposed to be moving out tomorrow. 


It was supposed to be beautiful weather today. 


It was beautiful weather. The sun was out, barely a cloud. 


I've left my door unlocked. 


It's just started to rain. 


The back door is open a crack.

,nosleep,"One night at about 2:30 AM, I was driving home from a party, the house the party was at was on the other side of the woods from my house. I drove there with a couple of friends but they said that they would take an Uber back because they wanted to stay a bit longer, but I had to go home because my little brother was home alone and he freaks out when he's alone for long periods of time. 

On the drive home, just before I reached the woods, I stopped at a gas station for some snacks so I could watch a movie with my brother when we got home. There was a deer with a scar on the bottom of his back left leg, I'm guessing because of an attack from another animal. The deer started staring at me... eerily. The deer ran off.

I got the snacks and drinks, worth quite a bit of money, way too much money. While I was driving through the woods. I saw the same deer as earlier, with a scar on his back left leg. I couldn't stop in time, I ran it over. I got out to see if it was okay. It was no longer living.

I felt horrible as I love all animals. I drove home and watched a few movies with my brother. We fell asleep late, about 7 AM, since it was Sunday and I only worked weekdays. I woke up at 10 AM, and I drove to King Soopers since my mom wanted me to pick up some groceries. Again, I had to go through the woods. The deer's body was gone, and as I was about to get out of the woods. I saw the same deer, with a scar on his back left leg.

I stopped, it looked at me, eyes all whited out, blood tinted fur. It stared at me, I stared at it. I stay there, paralyzed in fear. 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, what felt like hours, but it was really only 10:30 AM, suddenly, the deer leaps towards me, breaking my windshield. I close my eyes to brace for impact.

 I open my eyes, my windshield is perfectly in tact. But it's dark, I look at my phone. 3 AM, the same time that I hit the deer last night, but I was facing the direction to go to my house.

I had a bunch of snacks in the car, the same ones as last night, I get dizzy, I have a headache, my vision is dark, I take a drink of some water that I had in the car. I started driving. I see the deer, with the same scar. But also a huge gash in it's side.

When I was about 11 years old I lived in a remote area in West-Virginia. My house was not anything special just the type of house that you’d expect to be in a remote area in West-Virginia. There are some details that are important to this story. One we had a fireplace above it hang a fully operational m1 Garand. We’d use it to hunt some times. Two the house had just three rooms which where all on the same floor. a living room/kitchen and two bedrooms. In one room slept my parents and in the other slept me and my older brother. Now that that’s out of the way let’s get to the story.

It was a hot summer day me and my brother where playing in the fields when we heard a weird noise coming from the old barn at the edge of the of forest. He told me to go get the gun. While I was running home to get the gun I saw a man in long black trench coat and a fedora standing in the field looking at me but it could have been a scarecrow I’m not sure. I went into my house grabbed the gun ran back to my brother. He said we were going to take a look in the barn to see what had made that sound. We weren’t scared since animals often wandered into the barn but a little while ago we found a dead cow in the barn or what was left of it anyway. 

When entered the barn everything looked normal. We were about to leave when the sound of flesh being ripped apart came from the back of the barn my brother raised his gun as we slowly walked towards where the sound had come from. While we got closer we started to smell a terrible stench. We looked around the corner where the sound had come from. 

Around the corner sat a weird “human like” figure. I am saying “human like” because it had elongated limbs no hair and big black hollow eyes well it had eyes but where in normal people’s eyes you can see their emotions or at least some aliveness. That wasn’t the case with this creature. It was feeding on flesh. I was unable to see of what animal because it was mangled and ripped apart. The creature growled at us and prepared to attack. My brother pushed me aside and fired a shot at the thing. It let out an ear deafening scream then fell over.

My brother and I ran back home. Once there we screamed for our parents but they didn’t answer. We started looking through the house and eventually we found a note that said that they had gone to the nearby village because one of their cars had been stolen. It was starting to get dark by now so we closed all the windows and barricaded the front and back door. I couldn’t sleep that night. I was too scared. Luckily the creature left us alone for the rest of the night. No the real bad sh*t went down the next day. 

The morning started of normal. We ate breakfast and began to disassemble the barricade we had put up at the front door. Our parents weren’t back yet so we decided to go to the village and see if everything was all right. As we walked to the shed where my brothers motorcycle was stationed we noticed  that something was wrong. We couldn’t say what but something was most definitely off. We opened the shed and almost threw up. Blood and guts were everywhere and my brothers motorcycle laid there in pieces together with bones human bones. What appeared to be legs to be exact. We walked in to get the parts that we could still use. When I picked up the exhaust a drip of blood fell in my neck. I looked up and screamed. The torso’s of my parents were just hanging there. 

When we had scrapped everything we could still use and walked back to the house. As we walked back I saw something in the fields. I stopped to look and started to run. It was the creature! My brother ran after me and asked why I was running. I shouted that the creature was in the field and that it must’ve heard me scream. We ran into our house and barracked the door.

We opened the shed and almost threw up. Blood and guts were everywhere and my brothers motorcycle laid there in pieces together with bones human bones. What appeared to be legs to be exact. We walked in to get the parts that we could still use. When I picked up the exhaust a drip of blood fell in my neck. I looked up and screamed. The torso’s of my parents were just hanging there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we had scrapped everything we could still use and walked back to the house. As we walked back I saw something in the fields. I stopped to look and started to run. It was the creature! My brother ran after me and asked why I was running. I shouted that the creature was in the field and that it must’ve heard me scream. We ran into our house and barracked the door. Just in time because when we where done something banged on the door.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"This happened around the beginning of winter break last year. One of my good friends planned a trip to Tahoe to celebrate her birthday. There was about 12 of us sharing this beautiful AirBNB along the edge of a lake for the weekend.

The particular house we rented was at the very end of the row of houses. This meant we only had neighbors to one side of us and the other side was just bushes and trees and more forest. My friend likes to book houses toward the end or the edge of the block so we wouldn’t get in trouble for noise complaints. During the day the views of the lake and forests were amazing, but at night we were surrounded by pitch black darkness. The house seemed pretty modern and newly updated - a pool table in the game room, a hot tub in the backyard, etc. - no spooky vibes. One other cool feature of the house was it’s security system. For example, when you go out the front door, the security system would announce, “Front door opened” so it warned us when a door was opened and which door it was.

Let me paint a picture of the layout inside the house since it’s important to the story. The house had 3 different levels - the top floor was just the master bedroom and bathroom (the birthday girl and her boyfriend claimed this room); the second/main floor had the living room, the kitchen and dining room, and one bedroom and bathroom (I slept in the bedroom on this floor with 5 of my friends); the bottom floor had a game/rec room, and one bedroom and bathroom (the 4 remaining girls slept in this bedroom) - all connected by one winding metal staircase, you can’t get up and down unless you use these stairs.

Overall, the trip was really fun! The birthday girl got to turn up for her special day and it was the first time most of us had seen snow in person (we’re all from California so this was super exciting). On our last night there, we had been playing drinking games and hanging out in the hot tub in the backyard on the bottom floor. It was starting to get late and me and my friend (let’s call her Elaine) were the last two to get out of the hot tub. We had decided together we were going to try to stay up all night to help clean up the house and pack before we had to check out the next morning. 

(Sorry for the long introduction, but here’s where it gets... interesting)

It was around 5 or 6 in the morning and everyone had went to bed. It was just me, Elaine, and our other friend (we’ll call him Karl) awake playing Uno in the living room on the second/main floor of the house. Out of nowhere the security system goes off, “Back door opened.” 

We stop in the middle of our game and just look at each other like “What the fuck?”. Everyone had been asleep for hours as far as we knew. Now, there were some girls sleeping on the bottom floor where the back door is located so we initially thought it may have been one of them, maybe someone forgot something outside? We all stare at the staircase waiting for someone to come up the stairs but no one does. We call out their names waiting for someone to call back but no one responds. We’re still sitting at the table holding our cards and I’m scared shitless at this point - we didn’t know who came in the house, how they came in the house, or what they were doing in the house.

Karl brushed it off at first wanting to resume our game of Uno like we didn’t just get a warning that SOMETHING was in the house. He figured since no one responded it must be nothing. I told Karl that he had to go check what was going on downstairs since he was a fit 6-foot-tall guy and Elaine and I are both small 5-foot-tall girls. If it was really a killer, he would have the best chance right? He wouldn’t go down to check unless we went with him (lil bitch LOL). I thought it would be smart to arm ourselves so Karl grabbed this spray can and a lighter (which he used as a makeshift mini-flamethrower), Elaine grabbed a sharp fire poker by the fireplace, and I grabbed a knife from the kitchen. 

We decided to check the bedrooms upstairs and on the main floor first to make sure everyone was still in bed - everyone was accounted for and fast asleep. Then we followed Karl down the staircase. It was dark downstairs because all the lights were off so we used the flashlights on our phones but we still didn’t see anything suspicious. I checked the girls’ bedroom and bathroom - everyone was in bed where they were supposed to be and there was no one hiding under the beds or in the bathroom. We make our way to the back door that was said to be opened... it was. 

Karl quickly checks outside, shuts and locks the door, and we all run back upstairs. We just sit in the living room trying to talk about anything to get our minds off of what just happened. As I mentioned earlier, Elaine and I were the last people to come inside after using the hot tub. We kind of psyched ourselves out while we were back there looking out into the extensive blackness that surrounded us and wondering who or what could be lurking in it. When we came back inside that night, we made sure to lock the back door behind us. So I’m baffled as to how it was unlocked and opened. We were certain no one else had used that door after us. I was just relieved to see the sun finally rising but the three of us didn’t sleep at all that night. 

In the morning, we told everyone what we experienced. They all said that they didn’t see hear ANYTHING, not even when we checked in on them. They didn’t make a big deal out of it since we were leaving that morning anyways. But I could tell it still made them feel a little uneasy. I still don’t know who or what unlocked that door or what they wanted.

,nosleep,"I woke up suddenly early one morning to the sound of rustling in the lounge. With so few souls left living in it, the house was ordinarily quiet. I first checked on the baby, and thankfully, he slept safely in another room. I locked his door and went to investigate the noise.

As I entered the lounge, baseball bat in hand, the housekeeper sat in a peculiar position. She was in front of the fireplace, kneeling, head down. Atop the mantelpiece were my parents, put to rest in their ceramic urns. She whispered words in a stale tone, but I couldn't make them out.

Dianne had been their caretaker, and after they passed, I hired her along as housekeeper. It was the least I could do to keep company around.

I called out, but her prayer continued.

A silent moment went by before she rose and turned around, then admitted to not being able to sleep. She walked off into the kitchen, giving me her usual smile, and began her day.

Nothing extraordinary happened after that. Dianne went about her morning, and so did I. But as the days went by, something strange caught my attention. I never again found Dianne in front of the fireplace, but I did notice the mantelpiece remained well kept every single day. I understand it's in her job description, but things were never this well cleaned. Curiously, this only began happening after we moved my parent's ashes to the mantelpiece. I could only hope it was a coincidence.

I decided to run a little test. After Dianne had gone to bed, I intentionally cluttered the space around the urns, and during the night, I woke up early to see if she had cleaned it up. As I crept out into the hall, noises again came from the lounge. I had hoped for this to be an uneventful issue. Still, the suspicion that Dianne was somehow obsessed with the cremated remains of her former employers—my parents—planted itself in my paranoia.

When I entered the lounge, the mantelpiece had indeed been cleaned and reorganized, but Dianne was nowhere to be found. The room was empty. I walked around, inspecting the mantelpiece and my parent's urns. They were untouched, but the clutter was taken away.

Just then, Dianne walked into the dimly lit room, startling me. She asked if I wanted tea, to which I embarrassingly agreed, as if I was a child caught snooping in adult matters unbeknownst to me. We walked with silent steps, and upon seeing the tea kettle and cups, I realized she had been in the kitchen the whole time. I asked why she was up this early, but she gave a generic excuse. I confronted her again, this time asking about the mantelpiece and urns. Her face turned to mourning. She admitted that she dearly missed my parents. They had been a considerable chunk of her life and were much more than patients—they were family. The least she could do was keep their resting place well maintained.

After hearing her out, I let go of most of my suspicions. I'd be remiss if I didn't appreciate her dedication and compassion. A good caretaker becomes family, and family was the one thing I couldn't bear to lose more of now.

Though, I only let go of *most* suspicions, because as I went back to bed, I puzzled over one remaining mystery: Dianne doesn't drink tea. Her brew tasted awful, and I couldn't help but find the situation odd. Why would tea be prepared unless she knew I was coming? Also, I still didn't know why she was kneeling the first time I caught her.

My mind raced, caught up trying to understand what occurred in my home when I wasn't looking. Sure, she handled its care, but her devotion to my parent's remains unsettled me. I decided to continue investigating.

The following night I set up the next test. After Dianne put the baby to sleep, I went over and moved him into my room. I grabbed the baby monitor and placed it in the lounge, concealing it in a locked cabinet. After reconnecting it to the monitor beside my bed, I sat and waited. I didn't know what to expect. Perhaps it would be the rustling of Dianne cleaning the room again, or maybe her prayers in service to my parents. Whatever it would be, I wanted some sort of idea about what was going on.

The monitor stayed silent well into the deep night. Tired and dozing off, I was half asleep when the monitor started to flash. I jolted awake as the crackling sounds from its speaker disturbed the silence. Though muffled, Dianne's soft prayers whispered through the monitor. They seemed harmless, likely religious, though I didn't remember her being the type. She continued for ten minutes before finally stopping. What sounded like the rustling of cleaning followed, prompting me to end the operation in embarrassment. What kind of crazy person becomes suspicious of the caretaker? If she was any sort of twisted, surely we would have noticed by now.

I checked on the baby, then surrendered under the covers, defeated. The static continued from the speakers, and just as it melded into my dreams, my heart suddenly stopped. Now coming through the monitor was another voice, low and gritty. A male was speaking, talking to Dianne. And she was responding. Multiple voices rang through as I pressed my ear close and tried to make out their words.

One asked about its quality. Dianne vouched for it. Another asked if she had tested it yet. She did. They wanted to know more. She said it was of a fine quality, that its touch was holy. The smell was invigorating, and the taste rich—excellent in tea.

My stomach twisted as I remembered the tea Dianne made for me.

She continued telling the men that it would have many practical uses. For cooking and bathing, and even for kids, she said to them—for she had already tried it on the daughter's baby.

I froze. What did Dianne do to him? What did she do to my baby? My heartbeat grew loud. That was the final straw. I grabbed the aluminum bat and stormed out of the room to confront Dianne and her guests. They must have heard me coming, as the sound of trampling was followed by a loud crash from the lounge. I reached the front door and looked outside, but there was no one in sight.

I turned around and called out for Dianne, but the house stood quiet. The dark skies were lifting into a red dawn. As I inspected the room, a sickening scene awaited me as I stepped slowly towards the fireplace. My mother's urn, once atop the mantelpiece, lay shattered on the floor.

I carefully tried to collect the shards before realizing a horrifying detail. The urn pieces were scattered across the floor, yet my mother's cremated remains were nowhere to be found. Aside from the ceramic pieces, the room was suspiciously bare and clean.

My stomach wrenched as I connected the thought with their conversation—the tea, the smell, the *uses*. I quickly stood and checked my father's urn, still on the mantelpiece. It was empty.

They took it. They must have.

I barely had time to think before I heard the baby's cries. I hurried over, remembering Dianne claiming to have ""tested"" it on my baby.

,nosleep,"I participated in an experiment that will be etched into my mind until I die.

I can't forgive myself.

*Not after for what I did.*

...

The people who used to be people are just... not people anymore, if you can call it that.

Might as well just explain the experiment before the thought of suicide takes over.

My name is Mark Torvaski, I am a scientist that used to work in the Russian Federation in the Murmansk Region in a laboratory named ""Varanska Labs."" I have American heritage so I can type English well. Our project was on working on a modified gas composed of Oxygen and a newly discovered element listed as ""Herroxide"" in honor of the man who discovered it, Alexander Herrosavat. The goal was to produce a gas that the military would use to provide great abilities and to remove the barrier of the lifespan limit. Too bad he wasn't aware of the fact of something more deadlier that we'd produced would arise in this very lab.

There were 3 test subjects that took part in this lab: 1 American, 1 Chinese, and 1 Russian

When they entered the room, they would do things that any normal human would do: Take care of their bladders, entertain one another or themselves, and would satisfy their food, water, and sleep needs. They would tell backgrounds of each other which I have listed on my notepad. They were quite interesting.

The first one, the Chinese man, which is name was Lio, had a background of being an engineer and would work on the new infrastructure in his home country. He would also visit European countries and the USA for vacation before being taken to here and his disappearance had a made up excuse for that occurrence.

The second one, the American named Joshua, was an investor living in the state of North Carolina and was living alone investing on various companies from fashion to appliances. He planned of having a family to support because he was growing bored of living alone. The way he ended up here is the same as Lio's.

The third one, a Russian named Alex Yetri, had a criminal background of robbing many small stores and banks in the the city of Moscow. He used to have a family before they died of a car crash and he became addicted to alcohol and drugs and had to resort to thievery. Russia needed more test subjects so he was taken into the lab and landed here.

I also had my logs which I will put them here in this section.

Log 1:

""January 6th, 2012.

The gas has been turned on, normal behavior resumes.

I have explained to them that they have food and water to last a whole month, a toilet to take care of their needs and books for entertainment. By February 6th, 2012, they will be let out free to their home countries to enjoy life outside of the lab.

Or so I promised.

I feel guilty for lying, but orders are orders.

End log.""

Log 2:

""January 9th, 2012.

Normal behavior resumes.

Besides the fact that the Chinese one was acting off than his normal behavior.

End log.""

Log 3:

""January 11th, 2012.

Normal behavior resumes.

The American man had been speaking to himself all day while the Russian one had starting banging on the wall with his head lightly for an hour which resulted in mild brain trauma. It has been taken care of.

End log.""

Log 4:

""January 16th, 2012.

They are all off now. All of them started doing things that are not usual from their normal behavior. Like how the American and Russian ones have been scattering books from the bookshelves and ripping pages from the books. The Chinese one- wait, is that glue?

HEY! REMOVE THOSE PAGES OFF THE WINDOW NOW! I WILL GET SECURITY IF YOU DO NOT COMPLY WITH MY ORDERS! REMOVE THEM!

Goddammit. They covered the window with book pages and glue. I will have to figure out something out on that problem.

End log.""

Log 5:

""January 20th, 2012.

They're acting way out of the ordinary now.

The Chinese man had been screaming for 12 hours but they didn't sound human. They sounded from a monstrous being from a horror movie. The American one had ripped the camera out from the corner Northwest from the door which cut video feed from the room. From the footage. I could see the Russian one staring on the wall for how much hours does god know. They haven't slept since January 14th, 2012 and who knows what this gas this doing.

I wish I could undo some of this.

End log.""

Log 6:

""January 25th 2012.

Those test subjects don't sound human anymore. They've started banging on the reinforced window, which tore some pages from it which made me see something I wish to unsee. Their arms were grown with more greener and stronger ones with claws where used to be fingernails. Their nationality is starting to fade away from their new bodies along with their genders.

What did they do to them?

End log.""

Log 7:

""January 29th 20-

AAH!

THEY ARE NOT HUMAN ANYMORE MORE. I REPEAT. THEY ARE NOT HUMAN ANYMORE MORE. THE COVERS HAVE BEEN RIPPED OPEN WHICH SHOWS THEIR TRUE FORM. THEY LOOK LIKE GREEN REPTILIANS.

I do not know how much the window stands up before it shatters.

Why did they choose to do this experiment.

End log.""

Log 8:

""...

They did it.

Those beings did it.

They've broken out from their cells and breached the lab.

...

God may never forgive for what I did on this experiment.""

...

I have been hiding in my office for god knows how much time have I been hiding here. Whenever I peek outside of the door, I see bodies of my former colleagues and other test subjects shredded into pieces. They're all dead now.

...

The logs will stay here for as how much as history wants it to last but I can change the things I did and this event I partook in which was morally wrong and inhumane.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t forgive myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not after for what I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who used to be people are just... not people anymore, if you can call it that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might as well just explain the experiment before the thought of suicide takes over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Mark Torvaski, I am a scientist that used to work in the Russian Federation in the Murmansk Region in a laboratory named &amp;quot;Varanska Labs.&amp;quot; I have American heritage so I can type English well. Our project was on working on a modified gas composed of Oxygen and a newly discovered element listed as &amp;quot;Herroxide&amp;quot; in honor of the man who discovered it, Alexander Herrosavat. The goal was to produce a gas that the military would use to provide great abilities and to remove the barrier of the lifespan limit. Too bad he wasn&amp;#39;t aware of the fact of something more deadlier that we&amp;#39;d produced would arise in this very lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 3 test subjects that took part in this lab: 1 American, 1 Chinese, and 1 Russian&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they entered the room, they would do things that any normal human would do: Take care of their bladders, entertain one another or themselves, and would satisfy their food, water, and sleep needs. They would tell backgrounds of each other which I have listed on my notepad. They were quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one, the Chinese man, which is name was Lio, had a background of being an engineer and would work on the new infrastructure in his home country. He would also visit European countries and the USA for vacation before being taken to here and his disappearance had a made up excuse for that occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one, the American named Joshua, was an investor living in the state of North Carolina and was living alone investing on various companies from fashion to appliances. He planned of having a family to support because he was growing bored of living alone. The way he ended up here is the same as Lio&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third one, a Russian named Alex Yetri, had a criminal background of robbing many small stores and banks in the the city of Moscow. He used to have a family before they died of a car crash and he became addicted to alcohol and drugs and had to resort to thievery. Russia needed more test subjects so he was taken into the lab and landed here.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"Cambodia was not a place I had been before, nor was it a place I had ever planned to go. This whole, disastrous expedition started when a friend of mine pitched it as a solution to my looming monetary woes. It offered me a cheap cost of living, many times lower than that I could have found back in the states; a way to continue to work for myself as a copywriter without having to seek part-time work at some soul-crushing depression factory in the service industry. Perhaps more importantly, though, she saw it as a way to force me out of my shell into more regular interactions with the world around me.

Though I have never been prodded and probed for any traditional diagnosis, I am an excessively reserved person, with a disruptive distaste for interaction with new people and places that has long dictated the ebb and flow of my days. I would not describe the way I interact with the world as fearful, but rather, disinterested. I find great comfort in stewing alone among my thoughts for long periods, undisturbed by the intrusion of anything I don’t grant permission to intrude. The king of my own keep, in a sense, with the drawbridge firmly fastened against all but the most familial and vital company. 

Having seen me forced into a semi-regular schedule of public outings and social gatherings in college, my longtime friend thought this trip abroad could solve the dread of a nine-to-five job and my penchant for self-isolation in one fell swoop, allowing me fiscal security and independence on my own terms while also forcing me to do a bit of learning and exploring to find my way in a new place. Ever the schemer, she had sold the idea with a salesperson’s gusto that made her hard to rebuff, and the initial plan had been for us to go together, for she too was in search of greener and significantly cheaper pastures. The passing of her mother and the subsequent stress this placed on her family prevented this, though, and a departure together turned into a sort of delayed entry plan, with me deciding to keep my booked flight and go ahead, and her promising to follow in five or six months’ time, when things at home allowed her to operate for herself again.

The first week or so went smoothly enough. I picked up the social lubricant words –hello, please, thank you- that sort of thing. I made myself get out and see some of the museums in Phnom Penh. It was uncomfortable, the heat and my desire for quiet scratching at the back of my skull, but I was busy and entertained enough exploring temples and seeing sights to ignore it. That all changed once a week or two had passed, and I’d gotten settled in. Stripped of the excitable tourist’s fresh eyes and forgiving demeanor, the city became a different animal as experience stripped away the veneer of charm and I laid eyes upon the true face behind the mask.

The filth in Phnom Penh is omnipresent, its trash heaps ever looming and spilling into the streets while dogs run over weeks ago burst with maggots in the heat upon streets moldering after decades of neglect. The canals, murky stewpots filled with sewage and the rain-sodden garbage knocked down from the streets, stink under the heat of the sun as it rises through the day, making certain sectors of the concrete forest almost intolerable. Rats the size of a man’s forearm and roaches longer than my thumb flourish in the tropical heat amidst the murk, bold enough to leap over shoes and scuttle underfoot as pedestrians walk after dark. Wat Phnom, a well-aged jewel of a temple the better part of a thousand years old, is stalked by as many prostitutes as trinket vendors, its beauty lost in the sea of social decay. My rearing in southeastern Kentucky had taught me of poverty, but it was the utter dissolution of shame and restraint that truly shook me.

One reading this might think this is an indictment of Cambodia’s capital, but it isn’t uniquely a Cambodian problem. Cities in my home country, from New York to San Francisco to Atlanta, exhibit the same kind of disarray and filth, even if a better urban organizational structure keeps the visual horror in check. Human beings, packed in atop one another in numbers beyond tally, lose grasp of what life was like outside the towers of stone, and lose grasp of the niceties and boundaries that made existence tolerable before such terrible numbers were brought to bear. Even as the residents of such urban strongholds as Chicago or London proclaim their cultured produce of theater or art, they live existences that would make the founders of civilization weep. If whatever priest-kings raised Sumeria’s cities in the cradle of civilization could have witnessed the Phnom Penh today, they would burn their creations to the ground, to spare future generations such torment. The mouse utopia experiment comes to mind.

I should have expected such things, for I had seen cities of scale, whose occupants numbered in the millions, before. But the starry-eyed hope of the tourist combined with the sense of adventure and challenge promised by a new and uncomfortable environment blinded me to the weight of the stygian nightmare that is metropolitan life until I was already set up in my apartment with a six month lease to my name. The apartment, however, was comfortable, my landlady hospitable, and my rent spectacularly low. I resolved as those first few weeks came to an end that I would keep my head down, avoid discouragement, and get as much work done as possible while I rode out the inexpensive rent and mitigated my exposure to the outside world as much as possible. In half a year, with ten or twelve months of work under my belt in half the time, I could return to the states, either bolstered by more steady clients or stabilized by enough stored cash to keep me secure while I sought other ways to buoy my income. My friend, should she still aim to follow me then, could have the urban sprawl. I had seen more than enough already.

My existence was one of nearly monastic solitude scheduled around outings which were planned with great care to ensure the least friction possible. I left my room just once every week, to walk about eight blocks to a 24 hour grocery on a street not far from mine. During the first of these trips each month, I would stop by an ATM down a side street along the way and withdraw around four hundred dollars for rent and groceries, and on the way back, I would drop the 200 dollars owed for the month’s rent through the slot on my landlady’s door. The trips initially were plotted out to avoid the heat of the day, starting around nine at night, but after being accosted by a trio of toothless ladyboys astride a motorcycle looking for clients during one of these trips, I moved the schedule past midnight, to around two in the morning. At this hour, the residential streets were entirely empty save the occasional honking passage of a cab or motorbike, and offered me as placid an atmosphere to navigate the trash warrens as was possible, my safety from the city’s occasional knife crime ensured by the fact that I was nearly a foot taller than the tallest Cambodian man I had seen since landing in the country.  I was left alone with the rats and the stray dogs to operate like clockwork, counting the paces from block to block, knowing that it would take me nine minutes out and nine minutes back to complete my grocery run.

Between these walks, in the solitude of my apartment, only the occasional Gecko scurrying in under the balcony door of the fourth-floor room to escape the heat by camping on the cool interior wall troubled my doorstep, and I didn’t mind the silent intrusion. I ate, worked out, scanned email and job-posting boards for writing contracts, and typed. My focus was so complete that I could forget the days of the week, the hour of the day, and the posturing of the world beyond, the heavily curtained windows of my room keeping the dreadful humid sun of the equator at bay. There are many who would balk at that sparse a schedule, but with the occasional call to a friend or sibling back home keeping me connected, I had all the contact I needed. I thrive in a space all my own, on my own, and with nothing save a concrete hell beyond my door to distract me, my work flourished in the months I spent holed up in Phnom Penh. Right up until I took my second to last walk, as the day of my escape closed in on me.

I had just over five weeks to go before April 22nd, my planned departure date. I began my walk, aiming for the familiar store down the street and following my route without a single hiccup, mulling over a braggadocios biography I was working on for an Indian businessman’s personal website, my mind staying as far away from the squalor of the street as was possible. The road was unusually vacant, with only one or two loud bikes sputtering past during my initial trip. My shopping was done with mechanical skill: the same twelve items bought with the same three bills, a thank you to the now-familiar night cashier, and away I went, tossing a few cashew nuts to a friendly and legendarily mangy mutt that haunted the corner a block down from the shop when he approached to greet me, as was tradition. Things only went south near the end of the trip, when I reached one of the canals on the way back.

The canal, perhaps fifteen feet deep with a stew of stagnant liquid haunting its innards, ran off to both sides, visible in either direction for a block or so before another concrete bridge similar to the one I crossed blocked my view. It abutted the road which intersected my own, and as I looked down the way to ensure no speeding rickshaws or bikes were headed my direction, a burst of motion on the bridge to my left caught my eye. My initial thought was that a mugging was underway, but as I slowed and took in the scene on the quiet streets of this sleeping quarter of the city, I quickly dismissed that possibility.

An older man, who I can remember spotting on prior walks leaning against the canal rail as he dragged on cigarettes, had been seized from behind, a large figure nearly enveloping him as they struggled on the far bridge. This figure, a man at first glance, was overstretched and disproportioned, its skin the greenish-grey color of mold and its nude form tapering from a man’s wiry torso into a writhing lower body that looked almost like a snake’s. This tail, if that’s the word to describe it, was affixed to a rusted metal beam beneath the bridge, the willowy creature having clambered up over the rail to seize its target unaware. Its massive hands enveloped the old man’s head, whatever protest or screaming might have been done muffled before it could begin. When he fell, perhaps four or five seconds after I first spotted this baffling struggle, the creature let him fall, a fleshy tongue latched to its prey following the man’s throat as he went down. It stayed there, perched on the rail, for a few more seconds as it finished its work. Then, the tongue came free with an audible pop, a spike at its end making me think of hypodermic needles or a mosquito’s proboscis. This tongue withdrew with lightning speed like a frog’s before, in one fluid motion, the creature swung back under the bridge and dropped with a muted splash into the thick soup below in the canal, the ripples of its impact invisible in the shadows cast by the street lights above.

An approaching truck, perhaps the source of its departure, rumbled past on the road along the canal, jolting me back to awareness. After a glace back up at the man on the bridge, now laying lifeless on the pavement, the gleam of the truck’s lights brought my eyes back down to the water of the canal, where two glimmering pools of yellowish light gazed at me form the obscuring shadow. I didn’t need any more motivation than that.

I sprinted across the next street and up the following four blocks, almost to my building’s locked door in an alley off the road and fumbling with the keys in my pocket before I risked a glance back down the road towards the canal. The street was empty despite the pursuit I imagined was underway, but that didn’t stop me from shouldering through the entrance the second the key was turned and tossing my bagged groceries to the floor without mind for the noise, spinning to bar the metal door at my back the second I was safely inside. I gathered them up, stormed up the steep steps winding their way through the haphazard building, and hastily unlocked my own door, suddenly painfully aware of how close my top floor apartment sits to the open exit onto the covered roof where the laundry machines sit just up the stairs. Once my own door was bolted behind me, I could catch my breath, dwell on the insanity of what had just occurred, and weigh my options.

Fast deciding there was no way a report to the local police could end well, I opted to stay silent for the moment, and tell my story in a slightly edited form should I ever be questioned, with the seemingly inexplicable nature of the attacker evaded as best was possible. I settled into my usual routine as faithfully as I could, but vexation about what had occurred kept me from being the paragon of focus that was the norm. My work suffered, and my sleep suffered more, my already nocturnal schedule now a godsend as paranoia made me dread the thought of slumber in a darkened room. There was little rational drive to fear when I was locked away in my sturdy old apartment, but the feeling of fear haunted me all the same. It was, perhaps, this heightened sense of paranoia that ballooned my awareness enough to allow me to perceive the odd sounds which infiltrated the neighborhood in the days following my sighting.

In the dead of night, hours after the early-rising city had closed its doors and dimmed its lights, a kind of cackling screech could occasionally be heard echoing down the alleys and through the streets, a far cry from the cat screams and dog barks native to the area, which themselves seemed to have been erased form the night’s ambience. The best I can do to describe it is to indicate the more otherworldly vocalizations of foxes, but these calls were of a much deeper pitch, and carried a far greater distance around the rotten city they stalked. My isolated mind invested these noises with the shape of that thing form the canal, bringing its corpse-like flesh to my imagination as a companion to every scream through sleeping Phnom Penh. This persisted throughout the next week, growing more pronounced as the due date for my rent and the dwindling food in my small kitchen marched closer by the day. When the 22nd of March came, I had formulated a plan, one I felt sure would both appease my paranoia and keep me safe and secure until my departure in a month’s time.

I would depart the building, braving the crowds, hookers, and curious children of the early evening to feel more secured against things that go bump in the night amidst busier streets, and hit the ATM, retrieving my final rent payment and the money for the month’s groceries. Then, I would buy everything I could carry at the store, cautious to ration it once I got it back to my building, eliminating the need for any more shopping excursions during my stay in Cambodia. Finally, I would slip my rent through my landlady’s door, finalizing my fortified existence until April 22nd finally released me from my self-imposed prison, all while safe from the twisted phantoms I now imagined behind every corner on the streets outside.

The walk was uneventful, but continuously slowed by my jittery scans of the world around me, each clatter of rats in the trash heaps or street stalls closing up shop for the night making my heart leap at the sound. I diverted from my road toward the ATM one block down from where I usually walked to the southerly street, not wishing to walk alongside the canal where I had seen that inexplicable sight a week prior. I still had to cross the bridge on the way over, though, a process made only slightly easier by the passage of a loud band of drunken Australian expats on their way back from a bar, the raucous laughter making it seem less treacherous. Without incident, I rounded a corner and came within sight of the ATM, glad on one level that there were no people around this little street to witness a foreigner withdrawing cash, but equally perturbed by the silence that seemed to rule this little stretch of roadway. The hum of the Khmer Rouge-era streetlights overhead seemed to strangle the honks and engine growls of neighboring streets, my footfalls sounding catastrophically loud to me in a way that I knew was imagined. I ignored my nerves, and pressed into the little booth, focusing on the task at hand.

Flying through the process of the withdrawal with practiced ease urged on by the oppressive memory of the canal just up the road from where I stood, I emerged with money stowed safely away less than a minute later. I thought I noticed, during my paranoid scan of the roadway upon exiting the booth, a flurry of motion in the direction of the hated canal, but there were several gargantuan rats running here and there upon the roadway, so it was easy to shrug this off as a peripheral misinterpretation. Still, I made with speed for the store, going about my business with the same level of calculated efficiency as I had in the ATM. Outside, I was momentarily distracted by the absence of the familiar dog that haunted the street corner, but even after shaking the tin of cashews I’d bought, he didn’t surface, and I resolved to move on. By the time I passed the canal balancing three dangerously overfilled plastic bags on each side of me like some serf hauling grain, I estimated I had made better time on this final outing than on any other walk I’d made in the country thus far. Glances to either side of me showed nothing but the stinking cauldron of refuse below, and the omnipresent thrum of engines and voices guided me safely past the water and into the home stretch of this expedition into the urban unknown. It was only in the last harrowing minutes of the trip that things truly went south.

I arrived at my building’s door, about a third of the way down an alley which led to a little courtyard of dumpsters between the adjacent buildings, and set my bags on the ground to get the door unlocked, keys fast springing to hand. It was only after I had the door open, and bent to grab the bags one more, that I thought I spied a silhouette as it jerked back around the corner. My impression was of a head and shoulders rapidly withdrawn, but as I stood there in the bluish glow of the streetlight staring after movement I wasn’t certain was real, nothing resurfaced, and I forced myself to move into the door and bar it behind me, my fortress now closer than ever. My rent dropped off in typical fashion, I brushed past and up the steep stairs, turning on and off lights at each floor to show me the way through the dark, mindful not to crush geckos spending the night in the cool stairway. 

I rounded one corner, then the next, finally reaching the top floor apartment and once more setting down my bags to undo the padlock and enter my holdfast, safe from the world outside. I glanced to the rooftop doorway, thankful to see no trace of movement, and brought my bags inside, setting them right against the fridge and doubling back to lean out my door and turn off the light on the stairway. It was then that I saw it.

With the light clicked off, I turned, hand on the sturdy metal door handle, to close my apartment behind me, and as my eyes passed the moonlit canvas through the rooftop exit up the little stairway next to my door, I froze. Hanging from above the top of the doorway which had been empty just a moment before, long fingers gripping the top of the doorframe like a windowsill, was a noseless, slack-jawed face with great reddish eyes not dissimilar to those of a frog, blessedly obscured by the newly fallen darkness in the stairway. Beneath the wavering flap of skin making up its fleshy jaw, a tapering worm of pinkish sinew weaved back and forth like a snake charmer’s charge, its needle-like tip glinting with noxious spittle that dripped in moldering pools upon the tile of the stairs. The second’s hesitation felt long, halted, as if played out a half speed, but as it moved to swing itself into the stairway, I slammed shut the door in one fluid motion, the bolt being jammed into place with another. 

The door, forged of heavy metal and built to deter burglars, shouldn’t budge, but I backed away none the less, expecting some terrible clatter as the thing pounded against the gatehouse of its escaped prey. Instead, silence fell, and I was left standing in my front room between the sink and the fridge, groceries forgotten, for a half hour as I listened for noises from the stairway which never came. Once I finally made myself move, I crept up to the metal door and listened. Minutes stretched on, and still, no sound came. Relenting after nearly an hour on watch by the door, I backed away, at a loss as to how I should interpret what had just happened. All I could do in that moment was to ensure the padlock holding the bolt in place on the door was fastened and the lock set into the handle was turned, put the groceries away, and dim the lights. There were just three rooms in the apartment, with the kitchen and an adjoining bathroom up front and the bedroom in the back, and it was here than I holed up for the night. The balcony door, of the same metal make as the front door, was kept permanently locked, and the bars upon the window were well positioned and close together, giving me more than enough security to feel at least mildly safe. 

The night passed in silence, my mind on nothing save the rooftop doorway and that thing from the canal, until, at long last, the sun rose and the noises of the street swelled outside, allowing me enough ease to finally find sleep. Waking that afternoon from dreams stalked by rot-bathed wraiths and skittering rats, I immediately checked -and double checked- that my rationing plan was in order, and that my stored food could last me through the next four weeks. Then, steeling myself for the wait and trying my best to focus on work, I sat before my computer and pecked away at its keys, finding myself absently staring at the curtained window and pondering the streets beyond much more frequently than I’m comfortable admitting. When the sun set, stripping the thin lines of light from the edges of the curtains, I allowed paranoia to creep back in, silencing the music I had been playing and killing the loud fan in my room despite the heat, working in silence over my laptop with my ear honed for anything amiss.

The first night passed peacefully, my greatest disturbance being that those fox-like screeches had rather conspicuously disappeared from the streets outside, leaving the world beyond my curtained window an occasionally motorbike-desecrated churchyard of hushed anticipation. I planned my meals so that I did all my cooking in the front room kitchen near the stairs before the night had fallen, so the relative safety of my back room aided me in feeling at ease while I replayed in my mind the image of the slinking wretch from the canal hanging from the roof. I made an effort to sleep better the following day, settling in earlier in the morning and rising later in the afternoon, but that didn’t stop me from feeling haggard and worn by nightfall, the days of fretting starting to catch up to me. The second night would not go so smoothly.

It was two hours past midnight when I noticed a sniffing, not dissimilar from a dog’s but pitched low like that of the black bears back home, emanating from the bottom of my balcony door. It sounded once, drawing my eyes to the door in the dark, the blackness of the balcony beyond preventing me from making out any shadows cast on the small space between the door and the tiled floor. I froze and made as little sound as I could manage, ears straining for more sound. None came for fifteen or twenty agonized minutes, the air itself seeming cooler under the icy press of this terrified atmosphere. Then, a tendril of glistening flesh crept in beneath the door, snaking along the tiles like a serpent, its dark, wet form easily visible even in the darkened bedroom against the pale linoleum of the ground. The stink of the canals after a day’s boiling in the sun slunk in with it, permeating the room almost as soon as I spotted the intrusion. At its tip, the familiar pointed stinger or needle gleamed, leading its exploration of the room. 

From where I sat upon my bed, situated in the opposite corner of the room from the door, I inched back upon the mattress into the furthest corner, still endeavoring to make as little noise as possible. The thing on the balcony seemed to sense this, though, and the seeking tongue made its way for the bed, bringing the worst sorts of fear-conjured images to mind. Fortunately for me, the length of the vile protrusion fell short, and after several moments of straining there against the door in vain, it was withdrawn, disappearing back out into the night from whence it came and leaving a sort of slick snail trail in its wake. The tongue’s owner did not depart, though, occasionally sniffing at the crevice over the next hour or so, seeing if its quarry would attempt to move. When dawn began to approach, the noises died away as the thing returned to whatever safe hideaway it kept during the sun’s waking hours, and I fell into a nightmare-addled sleep, continuously waking to check the balcony door and sleeping with my closed eyes honed on the entryway, ready to snap open at the faintest sound.

That afternoon, still at a loss as to how I would report such an invasion without being accused of lunacy, I took my defense into my own hands. I went about fortifying my position against this new threat, setting my suitcase against the door to obscure the crevice at the base and weighing it down with filled water bottles and Tupperware to add bulk, covering these with shoes, clothes, spare cutlery, and anything else I could find that I felt would hinder the interloper. With perhaps seventy pounds crammed into the suitcase, my mind could sit a little easier. The next few nights, the thing continued its visits, but, with its tongue rebuffed by the suitcase, its probing was limited to sniffing at the door. By the end of the first week, the stalker form the canal seemed to have moved on, with those familiar fox-like noises I had begun to attach to its jawless visage resuming their serenade out on the streets of the city, echoing to my ears now and then. Days returned to normal, my paranoia gradually receding as first one week and then another was passed in relative peace. It was not to last, though, and during my final week in the apartment, my nocturnal caller would pay me one last, unexpected visit.

Though my nights had become less dreadful, that did not mean I had grown careless. Always, I endeavored to have my lights dimmed and my apartment silenced by sunset, to have any food or water I planned to consume during the night squirreled away next to my bed, and to get any necessary trips to the bathroom out of the way while the sunlight still shone on the roof above. That evening, I had decided to shower before the night confined me to my back room, beginning around six, while the sunset had yet to deepen the hues of the horizon beyond my walls. With nights being passed without air conditioning to better acquaint my ears with the world outside the window, I valued going into what I knew would be an uncomfortably humid night clean and relaxed. I had only been in the bathroom for three or four minutes, eyes closed against the water, when the fan mounted on the wall of the little space halted, its sudden silence oddly deafening. With power outages common in Phnom Penh, I fast shook away the water and backed out of the stream from the inexpensive wall-mounted water heating system on the wall, expecting my eyes to find the bathroom dark and anticipating a drop in water temperature after the loss of electricity. The cramped space, to my surprise, was still lit.

The building was old, and I am fortunate that in the moment I didn’t just ignore the halted fan and go about my business. Perhaps, even if I didn’t consciously associate the stairs with the fan at that moment, I reflexively recalled on some deeper level how close that fan set into the wall was on the stairway walls outside to the rooftop doorway, where just one month ago some unknown wretch had writhed in search of a new feast. My real salvation, however, was that wretched stink from the canals, reaching my nose and putting my heart into a ragged sprint. I looked to my right, eyes finding the small, dust-choked fan in the wall, and what I saw there sent me stumbling out the bathroom door and slamming it behind me with the water still running. It would stay that way for nearly two days, only being switched off when my landlady walked upstairs one morning to complain about how much water I must be using. Hanging there, twitching and thrashing in an attempt to force its way through the small opening between the plastic fan blades, was the familiar sheen of that needle-like proboscis, its bulk having stopped the fan cold while its owner hung latched to the wall of the stairway outside like some twisted vampiric treefrog, invisible to me save for that insectile, otherworldly tongue.

Eventually, my departure date arrived, and I had long worried that I would exit my apartment with suitcase and wallet in hand for my final walk down the precarious stairs to collect my security deposit and make for the airport only to find my unwanted visitor clinging to the stairway roof in protest to the sunlight outside, ready to finish the job. No such terrors came to pass. I arrived home about twenty-four hours after walking out the door for the final time, staying with friends until I could secure my own place, having survived that otherworldly visitor on the stairway. 

I have never, in several years spent pondering the events since, been able to piece together what that thing I saw beside the canal could have been, or why it had such a fascination with me after my chance encounter with it on the rat-stalked streets of Phnom Penh. No major news, official or unofficial, out of the Cambodian capital has commented on any strange disappearances or sightings save a blog post I stumbled on one day by an animal shelter in the city celebrating the sudden drop in the stray population in Phnom Penh, which I couldn’t help but lay at the feet- or tail, as the case may be- of a much more sinister presence than increased civic awareness. 

Perhaps it was several entities, the stalking being not a symptom of singular awareness, but rather of a hungry and growing population. I find this hard to believe, though, for the number of missing exsanguinated vagrants and night workers would be monumental. Equally hard to believe is the explanation of hallucinatory paranoia, for as comforting as it would be for me to sit here safe in the knowledge that no threat had ever been posed by the sniffing at my door and the snaking tongue worming its way through the fan, I have never in any period of stress or isolation since had any analogous experience, whether waking or sleeping. Rather, I’ve been forced to accept the possibility that, heavy as it weighs on my mind and disastrous as it is to my worldview, there is something monstrous stalking the canals, alleys, and rooftops of nocturnal Phnom Penh. Mostly, perhaps, it feasts on dogs, rats, cats and chickens as it claws its way through trash and across deserted streets. But occasionally, as I obsessively scroll through news feeds and blog entries made from Phnom Penh in the dark of particularly solitary nights, I stumble across a story about declining homeless populations in Cambodia’s capital, praising the uplifting grace of this or that government or non-profit initiative, and I am inclined to wonder how often someone, lying drunk or battered on the roads to sleep, is dragged down into the waters of the canals, never to surface again.",t2_4o5isv8t,False,,0,False,The Lurker on the Stairway,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgvnk5,False,dark,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583955016.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambodia was not a place I had been before, nor was it a place I had ever planned to go. This whole, disastrous expedition started when a friend of mine pitched it as a solution to my looming monetary woes. It offered me a cheap cost of living, many times lower than that I could have found back in the states; a way to continue to work for myself as a copywriter without having to seek part-time work at some soul-crushing depression factory in the service industry. Perhaps more importantly, though, she saw it as a way to force me out of my shell into more regular interactions with the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I have never been prodded and probed for any traditional diagnosis, I am an excessively reserved person, with a disruptive distaste for interaction with new people and places that has long dictated the ebb and flow of my days. I would not describe the way I interact with the world as fearful, but rather, disinterested. I find great comfort in stewing alone among my thoughts for long periods, undisturbed by the intrusion of anything I don’t grant permission to intrude. The king of my own keep, in a sense, with the drawbridge firmly fastened against all but the most familial and vital company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen me forced into a semi-regular schedule of public outings and social gatherings in college, my longtime friend thought this trip abroad could solve the dread of a nine-to-five job and my penchant for self-isolation in one fell swoop, allowing me fiscal security and independence on my own terms while also forcing me to do a bit of learning and exploring to find my way in a new place. Ever the schemer, she had sold the idea with a salesperson’s gusto that made her hard to rebuff, and the initial plan had been for us to go together, for she too was in search of greener and significantly cheaper pastures. The passing of her mother and the subsequent stress this placed on her family prevented this, though, and a departure together turned into a sort of delayed entry plan, with me deciding to keep my booked flight and go ahead, and her promising to follow in five or six months’ time, when things at home allowed her to operate for herself again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week or so went smoothly enough. I picked up the social lubricant words –hello, please, thank you- that sort of thing. I made myself get out and see some of the museums in Phnom Penh. It was uncomfortable, the heat and my desire for quiet scratching at the back of my skull, but I was busy and entertained enough exploring temples and seeing sights to ignore it. That all changed once a week or two had passed, and I’d gotten settled in. Stripped of the excitable tourist’s fresh eyes and forgiving demeanor, the city became a different animal as experience stripped away the veneer of charm and I laid eyes upon the true face behind the mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filth in Phnom Penh is omnipresent, its trash heaps ever looming and spilling into the streets while dogs run over weeks ago burst with maggots in the heat upon streets moldering after decades of neglect. The canals, murky stewpots filled with sewage and the rain-sodden garbage knocked down from the streets, stink under the heat of the sun as it rises through the day, making certain sectors of the concrete forest almost intolerable. Rats the size of a man’s forearm and roaches longer than my thumb flourish in the tropical heat amidst the murk, bold enough to leap over shoes and scuttle underfoot as pedestrians walk after dark. Wat Phnom, a well-aged jewel of a temple the better part of a thousand years old, is stalked by as many prostitutes as trinket vendors, its beauty lost in the sea of social decay. My rearing in southeastern Kentucky had taught me of poverty, but it was the utter dissolution of shame and restraint that truly shook me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reading this might think this is an indictment of Cambodia’s capital, but it isn’t uniquely a Cambodian problem. Cities in my home country, from New York to San Francisco to Atlanta, exhibit the same kind of disarray and filth, even if a better urban organizational structure keeps the visual horror in check. Human beings, packed in atop one another in numbers beyond tally, lose grasp of what life was like outside the towers of stone, and lose grasp of the niceties and boundaries that made existence tolerable before such terrible numbers were brought to bear. Even as the residents of such urban strongholds as Chicago or London proclaim their cultured produce of theater or art, they live existences that would make the founders of civilization weep. If whatever priest-kings raised Sumeria’s cities in the cradle of civilization could have witnessed the Phnom Penh today, they would burn their creations to the ground, to spare future generations such torment. The mouse utopia experiment comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have expected such things, for I had seen cities of scale, whose occupants numbered in the millions, before. But the starry-eyed hope of the tourist combined with the sense of adventure and challenge promised by a new and uncomfortable environment blinded me to the weight of the stygian nightmare that is metropolitan life until I was already set up in my apartment with a six month lease to my name. The apartment, however, was comfortable, my landlady hospitable, and my rent spectacularly low. I resolved as those first few weeks came to an end that I would keep my head down, avoid discouragement, and get as much work done as possible while I rode out the inexpensive rent and mitigated my exposure to the outside world as much as possible. In half a year, with ten or twelve months of work under my belt in half the time, I could return to the states, either bolstered by more steady clients or stabilized by enough stored cash to keep me secure while I sought other ways to buoy my income. My friend, should she still aim to follow me then, could have the urban sprawl. I had seen more than enough already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My existence was one of nearly monastic solitude scheduled around outings which were planned with great care to ensure the least friction possible. I left my room just once every week, to walk about eight blocks to a 24 hour grocery on a street not far from mine. During the first of these trips each month, I would stop by an ATM down a side street along the way and withdraw around four hundred dollars for rent and groceries, and on the way back, I would drop the 200 dollars owed for the month’s rent through the slot on my landlady’s door. The trips initially were plotted out to avoid the heat of the day, starting around nine at night, but after being accosted by a trio of toothless ladyboys astride a motorcycle looking for clients during one of these trips, I moved the schedule past midnight, to around two in the morning. At this hour, the residential streets were entirely empty save the occasional honking passage of a cab or motorbike, and offered me as placid an atmosphere to navigate the trash warrens as was possible, my safety from the city’s occasional knife crime ensured by the fact that I was nearly a foot taller than the tallest Cambodian man I had seen since landing in the country.  I was left alone with the rats and the stray dogs to operate like clockwork, counting the paces from block to block, knowing that it would take me nine minutes out and nine minutes back to complete my grocery run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between these walks, in the solitude of my apartment, only the occasional Gecko scurrying in under the balcony door of the fourth-floor room to escape the heat by camping on the cool interior wall troubled my doorstep, and I didn’t mind the silent intrusion. I ate, worked out, scanned email and job-posting boards for writing contracts, and typed. My focus was so complete that I could forget the days of the week, the hour of the day, and the posturing of the world beyond, the heavily curtained windows of my room keeping the dreadful humid sun of the equator at bay. There are many who would balk at that sparse a schedule, but with the occasional call to a friend or sibling back home keeping me connected, I had all the contact I needed. I thrive in a space all my own, on my own, and with nothing save a concrete hell beyond my door to distract me, my work flourished in the months I spent holed up in Phnom Penh. Right up until I took my second to last walk, as the day of my escape closed in on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just over five weeks to go before April 22nd, my planned departure date. I began my walk, aiming for the familiar store down the street and following my route without a single hiccup, mulling over a braggadocios biography I was working on for an Indian businessman’s personal website, my mind staying as far away from the squalor of the street as was possible. The road was unusually vacant, with only one or two loud bikes sputtering past during my initial trip. My shopping was done with mechanical skill: the same twelve items bought with the same three bills, a thank you to the now-familiar night cashier, and away I went, tossing a few cashew nuts to a friendly and legendarily mangy mutt that haunted the corner a block down from the shop when he approached to greet me, as was tradition. Things only went south near the end of the trip, when I reached one of the canals on the way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal, perhaps fifteen feet deep with a stew of stagnant liquid haunting its innards, ran off to both sides, visible in either direction for a block or so before another concrete bridge similar to the one I crossed blocked my view. It abutted the road which intersected my own, and as I looked down the way to ensure no speeding rickshaws or bikes were headed my direction, a burst of motion on the bridge to my left caught my eye. My initial thought was that a mugging was underway, but as I slowed and took in the scene on the quiet streets of this sleeping quarter of the city, I quickly dismissed that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An older man, who I can remember spotting on prior walks leaning against the canal rail as he dragged on cigarettes, had been seized from behind, a large figure nearly enveloping him as they struggled on the far bridge. This figure, a man at first glance, was overstretched and disproportioned, its skin the greenish-grey color of mold and its nude form tapering from a man’s wiry torso into a writhing lower body that looked almost like a snake’s. This tail, if that’s the word to describe it, was affixed to a rusted metal beam beneath the bridge, the willowy creature having clambered up over the rail to seize its target unaware. Its massive hands enveloped the old man’s head, whatever protest or screaming might have been done muffled before it could begin. When he fell, perhaps four or five seconds after I first spotted this baffling struggle, the creature let him fall, a fleshy tongue latched to its prey following the man’s throat as he went down. It stayed there, perched on the rail, for a few more seconds as it finished its work. Then, the tongue came free with an audible pop, a spike at its end making me think of hypodermic needles or a mosquito’s proboscis. This tongue withdrew with lightning speed like a frog’s before, in one fluid motion, the creature swung back under the bridge and dropped with a muted splash into the thick soup below in the canal, the ripples of its impact invisible in the shadows cast by the street lights above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An approaching truck, perhaps the source of its departure, rumbled past on the road along the canal, jolting me back to awareness. After a glace back up at the man on the bridge, now laying lifeless on the pavement, the gleam of the truck’s lights brought my eyes back down to the water of the canal, where two glimmering pools of yellowish light gazed at me form the obscuring shadow. I didn’t need any more motivation than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sprinted across the next street and up the following four blocks, almost to my building’s locked door in an alley off the road and fumbling with the keys in my pocket before I risked a glance back down the road towards the canal. The street was empty despite the pursuit I imagined was underway, but that didn’t stop me from shouldering through the entrance the second the key was turned and tossing my bagged groceries to the floor without mind for the noise, spinning to bar the metal door at my back the second I was safely inside. I gathered them up, stormed up the steep steps winding their way through the haphazard building, and hastily unlocked my own door, suddenly painfully aware of how close my top floor apartment sits to the open exit onto the covered roof where the laundry machines sit just up the stairs. Once my own door was bolted behind me, I could catch my breath, dwell on the insanity of what had just occurred, and weigh my options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast deciding there was no way a report to the local police could end well, I opted to stay silent for the moment, and tell my story in a slightly edited form should I ever be questioned, with the seemingly inexplicable nature of the attacker evaded as best was possible. I settled into my usual routine as faithfully as I could, but vexation about what had occurred kept me from being the paragon of focus that was the norm. My work suffered, and my sleep suffered more, my already nocturnal schedule now a godsend as paranoia made me dread the thought of slumber in a darkened room. There was little rational drive to fear when I was locked away in my sturdy old apartment, but the feeling of fear haunted me all the same. It was, perhaps, this heightened sense of paranoia that ballooned my awareness enough to allow me to perceive the odd sounds which infiltrated the neighborhood in the days following my sighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dead of night, hours after the early-rising city had closed its doors and dimmed its lights, a kind of cackling screech could occasionally be heard echoing down the alleys and through the streets, a far cry from the cat screams and dog barks native to the area, which themselves seemed to have been erased form the night’s ambience. The best I can do to describe it is to indicate the more otherworldly vocalizations of foxes, but these calls were of a much deeper pitch, and carried a far greater distance around the rotten city they stalked. My isolated mind invested these noises with the shape of that thing form the canal, bringing its corpse-like flesh to my imagination as a companion to every scream through sleeping Phnom Penh. This persisted throughout the next week, growing more pronounced as the due date for my rent and the dwindling food in my small kitchen marched closer by the day. When the 22nd of March came, I had formulated a plan, one I felt sure would both appease my paranoia and keep me safe and secure until my departure in a month’s time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would depart the building, braving the crowds, hookers, and curious children of the early evening to feel more secured against things that go bump in the night amidst busier streets, and hit the ATM, retrieving my final rent payment and the money for the month’s groceries. Then, I would buy everything I could carry at the store, cautious to ration it once I got it back to my building, eliminating the need for any more shopping excursions during my stay in Cambodia. Finally, I would slip my rent through my landlady’s door, finalizing my fortified existence until April 22nd finally released me from my self-imposed prison, all while safe from the twisted phantoms I now imagined behind every corner on the streets outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk was uneventful, but continuously slowed by my jittery scans of the world around me, each clatter of rats in the trash heaps or street stalls closing up shop for the night making my heart leap at the sound. I diverted from my road toward the ATM one block down from where I usually walked to the southerly street, not wishing to walk alongside the canal where I had seen that inexplicable sight a week prior. I still had to cross the bridge on the way over, though, a process made only slightly easier by the passage of a loud band of drunken Australian expats on their way back from a bar, the raucous laughter making it seem less treacherous. Without incident, I rounded a corner and came within sight of the ATM, glad on one level that there were no people around this little street to witness a foreigner withdrawing cash, but equally perturbed by the silence that seemed to rule this little stretch of roadway. The hum of the Khmer Rouge-era streetlights overhead seemed to strangle the honks and engine growls of neighboring streets, my footfalls sounding catastrophically loud to me in a way that I knew was imagined. I ignored my nerves, and pressed into the little booth, focusing on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying through the process of the withdrawal with practiced ease urged on by the oppressive memory of the canal just up the road from where I stood, I emerged with money stowed safely away less than a minute later. I thought I noticed, during my paranoid scan of the roadway upon exiting the booth, a flurry of motion in the direction of the hated canal, but there were several gargantuan rats running here and there upon the roadway, so it was easy to shrug this off as a peripheral misinterpretation. Still, I made with speed for the store, going about my business with the same level of calculated efficiency as I had in the ATM. Outside, I was momentarily distracted by the absence of the familiar dog that haunted the street corner, but even after shaking the tin of cashews I’d bought, he didn’t surface, and I resolved to move on. By the time I passed the canal balancing three dangerously overfilled plastic bags on each side of me like some serf hauling grain, I estimated I had made better time on this final outing than on any other walk I’d made in the country thus far. Glances to either side of me showed nothing but the stinking cauldron of refuse below, and the omnipresent thrum of engines and voices guided me safely past the water and into the home stretch of this expedition into the urban unknown. It was only in the last harrowing minutes of the trip that things truly went south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at my building’s door, about a third of the way down an alley which led to a little courtyard of dumpsters between the adjacent buildings, and set my bags on the ground to get the door unlocked, keys fast springing to hand. It was only after I had the door open, and bent to grab the bags one more, that I thought I spied a silhouette as it jerked back around the corner. My impression was of a head and shoulders rapidly withdrawn, but as I stood there in the bluish glow of the streetlight staring after movement I wasn’t certain was real, nothing resurfaced, and I forced myself to move into the door and bar it behind me, my fortress now closer than ever. My rent dropped off in typical fashion, I brushed past and up the steep stairs, turning on and off lights at each floor to show me the way through the dark, mindful not to crush geckos spending the night in the cool stairway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rounded one corner, then the next, finally reaching the top floor apartment and once more setting down my bags to undo the padlock and enter my holdfast, safe from the world outside. I glanced to the rooftop doorway, thankful to see no trace of movement, and brought my bags inside, setting them right against the fridge and doubling back to lean out my door and turn off the light on the stairway. It was then that I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the light clicked off, I turned, hand on the sturdy metal door handle, to close my apartment behind me, and as my eyes passed the moonlit canvas through the rooftop exit up the little stairway next to my door, I froze. Hanging from above the top of the doorway which had been empty just a moment before, long fingers gripping the top of the doorframe like a windowsill, was a noseless, slack-jawed face with great reddish eyes not dissimilar to those of a frog, blessedly obscured by the newly fallen darkness in the stairway. Beneath the wavering flap of skin making up its fleshy jaw, a tapering worm of pinkish sinew weaved back and forth like a snake charmer’s charge, its needle-like tip glinting with noxious spittle that dripped in moldering pools upon the tile of the stairs. The second’s hesitation felt long, halted, as if played out a half speed, but as it moved to swing itself into the stairway, I slammed shut the door in one fluid motion, the bolt being jammed into place with another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door, forged of heavy metal and built to deter burglars, shouldn’t budge, but I backed away none the less, expecting some terrible clatter as the thing pounded against the gatehouse of its escaped prey. Instead, silence fell, and I was left standing in my front room between the sink and the fridge, groceries forgotten, for a half hour as I listened for noises from the stairway which never came. Once I finally made myself move, I crept up to the metal door and listened. Minutes stretched on, and still, no sound came. Relenting after nearly an hour on watch by the door, I backed away, at a loss as to how I should interpret what had just happened. All I could do in that moment was to ensure the padlock holding the bolt in place on the door was fastened and the lock set into the handle was turned, put the groceries away, and dim the lights. There were just three rooms in the apartment, with the kitchen and an adjoining bathroom up front and the bedroom in the back, and it was here than I holed up for the night. The balcony door, of the same metal make as the front door, was kept permanently locked, and the bars upon the window were well positioned and close together, giving me more than enough security to feel at least mildly safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night passed in silence, my mind on nothing save the rooftop doorway and that thing from the canal, until, at long last, the sun rose and the noises of the street swelled outside, allowing me enough ease to finally find sleep. Waking that afternoon from dreams stalked by rot-bathed wraiths and skittering rats, I immediately checked -and double checked- that my rationing plan was in order, and that my stored food could last me through the next four weeks. Then, steeling myself for the wait and trying my best to focus on work, I sat before my computer and pecked away at its keys, finding myself absently staring at the curtained window and pondering the streets beyond much more frequently than I’m comfortable admitting. When the sun set, stripping the thin lines of light from the edges of the curtains, I allowed paranoia to creep back in, silencing the music I had been playing and killing the loud fan in my room despite the heat, working in silence over my laptop with my ear honed for anything amiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night passed peacefully, my greatest disturbance being that those fox-like screeches had rather conspicuously disappeared from the streets outside, leaving the world beyond my curtained window an occasionally motorbike-desecrated churchyard of hushed anticipation. I planned my meals so that I did all my cooking in the front room kitchen near the stairs before the night had fallen, so the relative safety of my back room aided me in feeling at ease while I replayed in my mind the image of the slinking wretch from the canal hanging from the roof. I made an effort to sleep better the following day, settling in earlier in the morning and rising later in the afternoon, but that didn’t stop me from feeling haggard and worn by nightfall, the days of fretting starting to catch up to me. The second night would not go so smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was two hours past midnight when I noticed a sniffing, not dissimilar from a dog’s but pitched low like that of the black bears back home, emanating from the bottom of my balcony door. It sounded once, drawing my eyes to the door in the dark, the blackness of the balcony beyond preventing me from making out any shadows cast on the small space between the door and the tiled floor. I froze and made as little sound as I could manage, ears straining for more sound. None came for fifteen or twenty agonized minutes, the air itself seeming cooler under the icy press of this terrified atmosphere. Then, a tendril of glistening flesh crept in beneath the door, snaking along the tiles like a serpent, its dark, wet form easily visible even in the darkened bedroom against the pale linoleum of the ground. The stink of the canals after a day’s boiling in the sun slunk in with it, permeating the room almost as soon as I spotted the intrusion. At its tip, the familiar pointed stinger or needle gleamed, leading its exploration of the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From where I sat upon my bed, situated in the opposite corner of the room from the door, I inched back upon the mattress into the furthest corner, still endeavoring to make as little noise as possible. The thing on the balcony seemed to sense this, though, and the seeking tongue made its way for the bed, bringing the worst sorts of fear-conjured images to mind. Fortunately for me, the length of the vile protrusion fell short, and after several moments of straining there against the door in vain, it was withdrawn, disappearing back out into the night from whence it came and leaving a sort of slick snail trail in its wake. The tongue’s owner did not depart, though, occasionally sniffing at the crevice over the next hour or so, seeing if its quarry would attempt to move. When dawn began to approach, the noises died away as the thing returned to whatever safe hideaway it kept during the sun’s waking hours, and I fell into a nightmare-addled sleep, continuously waking to check the balcony door and sleeping with my closed eyes honed on the entryway, ready to snap open at the faintest sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That afternoon, still at a loss as to how I would report such an invasion without being accused of lunacy, I took my defense into my own hands. I went about fortifying my position against this new threat, setting my suitcase against the door to obscure the crevice at the base and weighing it down with filled water bottles and Tupperware to add bulk, covering these with shoes, clothes, spare cutlery, and anything else I could find that I felt would hinder the interloper. With perhaps seventy pounds crammed into the suitcase, my mind could sit a little easier. The next few nights, the thing continued its visits, but, with its tongue rebuffed by the suitcase, its probing was limited to sniffing at the door. By the end of the first week, the stalker form the canal seemed to have moved on, with those familiar fox-like noises I had begun to attach to its jawless visage resuming their serenade out on the streets of the city, echoing to my ears now and then. Days returned to normal, my paranoia gradually receding as first one week and then another was passed in relative peace. It was not to last, though, and during my final week in the apartment, my nocturnal caller would pay me one last, unexpected visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though my nights had become less dreadful, that did not mean I had grown careless. Always, I endeavored to have my lights dimmed and my apartment silenced by sunset, to have any food or water I planned to consume during the night squirreled away next to my bed, and to get any necessary trips to the bathroom out of the way while the sunlight still shone on the roof above. That evening, I had decided to shower before the night confined me to my back room, beginning around six, while the sunset had yet to deepen the hues of the horizon beyond my walls. With nights being passed without air conditioning to better acquaint my ears with the world outside the window, I valued going into what I knew would be an uncomfortably humid night clean and relaxed. I had only been in the bathroom for three or four minutes, eyes closed against the water, when the fan mounted on the wall of the little space halted, its sudden silence oddly deafening. With power outages common in Phnom Penh, I fast shook away the water and backed out of the stream from the inexpensive wall-mounted water heating system on the wall, expecting my eyes to find the bathroom dark and anticipating a drop in water temperature after the loss of electricity. The cramped space, to my surprise, was still lit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building was old, and I am fortunate that in the moment I didn’t just ignore the halted fan and go about my business. Perhaps, even if I didn’t consciously associate the stairs with the fan at that moment, I reflexively recalled on some deeper level how close that fan set into the wall was on the stairway walls outside to the rooftop doorway, where just one month ago some unknown wretch had writhed in search of a new feast. My real salvation, however, was that wretched stink from the canals, reaching my nose and putting my heart into a ragged sprint. I looked to my right, eyes finding the small, dust-choked fan in the wall, and what I saw there sent me stumbling out the bathroom door and slamming it behind me with the water still running. It would stay that way for nearly two days, only being switched off when my landlady walked upstairs one morning to complain about how much water I must be using. Hanging there, twitching and thrashing in an attempt to force its way through the small opening between the plastic fan blades, was the familiar sheen of that needle-like proboscis, its bulk having stopped the fan cold while its owner hung latched to the wall of the stairway outside like some twisted vampiric treefrog, invisible to me save for that insectile, otherworldly tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my departure date arrived, and I had long worried that I would exit my apartment with suitcase and wallet in hand for my final walk down the precarious stairs to collect my security deposit and make for the airport only to find my unwanted visitor clinging to the stairway roof in protest to the sunlight outside, ready to finish the job. No such terrors came to pass. I arrived home about twenty-four hours after walking out the door for the final time, staying with friends until I could secure my own place, having survived that otherworldly visitor on the stairway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never, in several years spent pondering the events since, been able to piece together what that thing I saw beside the canal could have been, or why it had such a fascination with me after my chance encounter with it on the rat-stalked streets of Phnom Penh. No major news, official or unofficial, out of the Cambodian capital has commented on any strange disappearances or sightings save a blog post I stumbled on one day by an animal shelter in the city celebrating the sudden drop in the stray population in Phnom Penh, which I couldn’t help but lay at the feet- or tail, as the case may be- of a much more sinister presence than increased civic awareness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was several entities, the stalking being not a symptom of singular awareness, but rather of a hungry and growing population. I find this hard to believe, though, for the number of missing exsanguinated vagrants and night workers would be monumental. Equally hard to believe is the explanation of hallucinatory paranoia, for as comforting as it would be for me to sit here safe in the knowledge that no threat had ever been posed by the sniffing at my door and the snaking tongue worming its way through the fan, I have never in any period of stress or isolation since had any analogous experience, whether waking or sleeping. Rather, I’ve been forced to accept the possibility that, heavy as it weighs on my mind and disastrous as it is to my worldview, there is something monstrous stalking the canals, alleys, and rooftops of nocturnal Phnom Penh. Mostly, perhaps, it feasts on dogs, rats, cats and chickens as it claws its way through trash and across deserted streets. But occasionally, as I obsessively scroll through news feeds and blog entries made from Phnom Penh in the dark of particularly solitary nights, I stumble across a story about declining homeless populations in Cambodia’s capital, praising the uplifting grace of this or that government or non-profit initiative, and I am inclined to wonder how often someone, lying drunk or battered on the roads to sleep, is dragged down into the waters of the canals, never to surface again.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I run a quaint bed and breakfast in Maine. Despite the mild winter, it’s been slow, to say the least. Two families passed through as well as a nature photographer, but aside from them, I’ve been pretty much alone the past few months. As I was sipping my coffee and staring out to the white sands, I saw a dark shape bobbing in the icy waters.

At first, I thought it was debris of some sort. Litter from partying boaters often makes its way to the shore; bottles, cans and other jetsam are not uncommon. But when I saw the inky black hair float up to reveal a face, my heart sank.

I suspected it was a dead body. A few years back an elderly woman, later found to have suffered from dementia, washed up after drowning in the middle of the night. I put on my coat and walked out into the cool breeze to check, and I watched as the head rose higher up from the skim between lapping waves. A neck and then shoulders poked through the surface. A man was standing upright in the water, walking in from the sea.

Worry shifted tightly into fear at the unlikely sight. I slowed my fast approach on the shifting sands to watch as a soaked-through blazer and tie, both black, raised higher still. Stiff arms dangled at his sides as he walked out of the freezing ocean.

“Sir, are you alright?” I yelled out to him as the cold wind rippled my hair. I took a few more steps to look for any tracks leading to the water, wondering if I’d somehow missed him entering it in the first place. There were no boats anywhere near the horizon and no tracks aside from the ones he made as he fully emerged to walk upon the damp sand. 

The man didn’t answer. He just continued advancing towards me in a slow stride. His wet, black suit was soaked through, and it looked to be an odd cut, a bit out of fashion. His skin was pale and his eyes were dark and inset. His narrow face remained expressionless.

It’s important to note the water is around 35° Fahrenheit this time of year, just above freezing. There was no way he should have been conscious, let alone walking after the amount of time he’d have had to be in there for me not to have seen him. Not to mention, the time he must have been submerged alone would have drowned him. Still, this man was moving quickly as he marched towards my residence. I called out once again as I took a step back to my door. 

“Sir, do you need help? I can call an ambulance.” He walked closer, closing the distance. 30 meters became ten, and soon he was nearly upon me. I panicked. I stepped back into my house and watched in horror as he drew closer.

The man was pasty and white, his skin bloodless and bloated. His eyes were black as a fish’s and his pockets spilled out shiny ribbons of seaweed. Each slow step released seawater from his black leather shoes. The man’s white lips parted and water began to trickle out in a steady stream. He then made a series of deep, throaty clicks; hollow and deep.

I yanked the sliding patio door closed and locked it. I took my phone out and watched as the man walked up to my glass door, stopping only after banging his forehead into my sliding glass door with a solid *clunk*. 

He stared at me with empty black eyes. His white, waxen hands raised up and pressed pruney fingers against the glass. His mouth widened, leaking out saltwater until his jaw let out a sickening pop. 

I watched, frozen with peaking horror as translucent strands of gelatinous rope spilled down from his mouth, dangling like living cellophane noodles from the rotten teeth in his black gums. The texture resembled jellyfish, but the form was unlike anything I’d ever seen. The man’s vacant stare locked onto my eyes and his palms then closed into fists. He began to pound on the glass with jarring slams, and I screamed.

I retreated to my bedroom as those slamming fists beat against the glass. I dialed 911 and listened in horror to the rattling thuds that boomed like a drum. 

I explained someone was breaking in and gave them the address to my guesthouse in Moody, Maine. I answered the questions as calmly as I could until I heard a high-pitched crack along with the loud thuds. My heart raced. The large windows were storm-proof but wouldn’t hold forever. 

I begged them to hurry as I searched for a weapon. I grabbed my old squash racket as I listened to the intense thuds continue for a minute or so.

After a few minutes, however, the banging stopped. I could then hear my heartbeat in my ears as I listened for any sound other than the wailing wind. I approached my bedroom window and stared out.

The frothy waves slapped the sands, misting the air from the wind. Soon, the back of the man was visible as he walked back towards the water. I watched, transfixed as he continued his march back into the ocean, each leg carrying him deeper into the crashing waves until they vanished in the surf. He continued on, shrinking in size and sinking into the declining shelf until only his head was visible, and soon that too disappeared beneath the break. I stared for a solid ten minutes in disbelief, but he was gone. I finally breathed a sigh of relief, still rattled and confused.

It took another fifteen minutes for the police to arrive, and by then I knew how ridiculous my story sounded. I recounted the strange occurrence regardless, detailing his appearance and demeanor. I led them to the door, which was wet from his pounding fists. A tiny crack was visible in the pane. I received the obligatory line of questioning regarding drug or alcohol use, but they could see I was dead sober and this was not a prank, publicity stunt or simple misunderstanding. Additionally, there was a single set of footprints leading to my house and back to the ocean, which confirmed my bizarre story.

I was advised to keep my doors locked and told it was likely some confused renter. They didn’t believe me, but the man was gone and I knew how ridiculous my story sounded. After a small chat about the weather and being told to call back if anything else happened, they took off. I then expected it to turn into a bizarre tale I’d later share with my friends at the pub over a pint. I even began to question whether I’d just missed some obvious explanation as the sunset blazed across the ocean and vanished beneath the horizon.

When night came, I saw the other dark shapes floating on the waves. I watched in disbelief as a dozen pale individuals slowly rose from the water. Their widening jaws dangled strings of jelly from rotten teeth as they emerged from the ocean and onto the sand.

Among them was the man from earlier. He hadn't left to return to wherever he’d come from.

Next: Another Case File One Assumes

*Case File: 0X0-X0X*

*Case File Date: Not now.*

*Location: Not here.*

*Subject: Us.*

*Entity: Him.*

*You must be looking for another Tale by now, after all, we only have three left till the end of them, the end of me. This is fine, and I’ll comply.*

*Why don’t I tell you about the time that Earth-A Secrets and I hunted down a serial killer back in our own world? Of course we had a little help back then…*

*Here’s the general idea: some being was hunting down women in the outer slums of San Francisco. Kawaisou Town is what they called it. In the world where I come from this area contained slums as far as the eye could see, housing a rather significant Japanese population. They were second-rate citizens displaced after “The Bloody Invasion” from WWII. Quite frankly, I’m sure many from my Earth would have preferred the outcome of your World War Two as opposed to our own, but that’s conversation for a different day perhaps.*

*The being we were hunting was quite similar to the Jack of this Earth. It hunted women, took parts of their bodies, and then fled the scene. From the few witnesses that had seen the being it appeared to be a slim, humanoid creature with inhuman agility. Apparently it could climb walls and leap up buildings with ease. As one of the first missions assigned to Secrets-A I knew we had to call in one more man to help out. He was someone I had worked with before, a real professional, and I wanted him to show Secrets-A the ropes.*

*It wasn’t long before we met up with him, a man you may know as Hoffer. Even back then Hoffer was a go-getter, a real company man, but he wasn’t quite the monster that he is today…*

*It appears that Hoffer had been tailing our target long before the two of us were assigned to this mission. That was one of the more decidedly odd things about Hoffer, he had this list of entities known only to him and he would simply stalk these beings and observe. I’m not one to talk, but that’s simply not healthy.*

*Hoffer described a being that I was quite frankly nervous to expose Secrets-A to. This entity was paranormal in nature, something I already wanted to avoid him being around, I was afraid of anything that would affect his current treatment. The last thing I wanted was for the entity within him to burst forth. That would have been messy. And messy is something neither my superiors nor heart could take. No sir.*

*Hoffer decided that our best course of action would be to lay a trap for the being. I certainly didn’t have any better ideas. I do remember it being a moral issue however. Hoffer wanted to use live bait, an unsuspecting woman, to draw in the monster. I was more than fine with this as well but Secrets-A was having none of it at first. I had to assure him of all the precautions that we would take in order to guarantee the woman’s life. He was such a soft person, despite the malicious being that lay under his skin.*

*In the end we decided to have a fellow agent play the part of our unsuspecting female. Hoffer was more than annoyed that we weren’t using someone completely in the dark. He felt that the entity would be able to feel that she was a trap. But, I put down my foot. I wasn’t quite the big deal in O440-A but I had enough clout that he wouldn’t argue with me beyond petty bickering. Plus, it made Secrets-A feel better. An overall win in my little book.*

*So the night of our little hunt began. And guess what? It was a dud. Our killer didn't take the bait. But we were swathed in persistence so we kept trying. This went on for about a week with little headway and Hoffer and Secrets-A were at each other's throats the entire time. Those two were entirely different on a fundamental level. It was also a testament to how ballsy Hoffer could be. At this point in time he was little more than an extremely well trained human while Secrets-A positively reeked with paranormal energy that outclassed most of what we came across in my home dimension.*

*On the seventh day we rested. Wait, no, we caught our prey. Sorry, wrong congregation. The entity finally took the bait and chased after our young maiden. Operative Oda knew her stuff however, and deftly led our quarry to the designated spot almost flawlessly. Almost. Unfortunately for our little operation a beleaguered couple happened to be in the splash zone. The entity veered off just short of the target destination in pursuit of new prey.*

*The first woman of the pair didn't even have time to realize her head had been cleaved clean of the body it once was attached too. Her fellow party member sure had enough time to process everything and fall to the ground in a sobbing, screaming heap.*

*The being scrambled over to the decapitated corpse and with a bit of windup proceeded to bury its arm elbow deep in her guts, rooting around for whatever organ it craved. It was then that I got a decent look at our quarry. Here in this dimension the closest thing I could compare it to that you would recognize would be Stalkers, although it lacked the extra arms. It is quite amusing that this entity wouldn't even be considered a key player in our current dimension, yet it proved quite troublesome to us over in Earth-A.*

*The Psuedo-Stalker finished pulling some odd entrail out of the corpse and slurped it down in a manner very reminiscent of a child slurping spaghetti. Without skipping a beat it pounced on the other woman and held her down by the throat, squeezing until each eyeball popped from their respective socket. I remember that at this point Hoffer ordered Oda to get closer and distract the entity while the three of us moved onto its location.*

*Oda did as she was told and appeared at the far end of the alley, making as much noise as she could to get the thing's attention. The beast was having none of this though and after slurping up its second course it looked to jump up to the rooftops and out of our reach where it would probably lay low and choose a new hunting ground.*

*A sudden shot rang out and Oda fell to the ground clutching her leg. Ah, the Hoffer Special: shoot a limb and make his move. Even back then he was an utter snake. But his methods did get results as our little Stalker wannabe immediately sensed Oda's weakness and looked to gain a hat trick. With a quickness the being had yet to display it slunk over to the wounded Oda knowing all the while that we lurked nearby. The poor Operative could only look on in horror as the being lifted two long, spindly clawed fingers and entered into her eye sockets, causing two seperate popping noises and her body to begin convulsing.*

*This rather macabre scene was interrupted by a shriek of pure anger. Secrets-A had just stumbled upon Oda's demise happening in real time, and he was none too happy with how our ambush had played out. His inhuman yell ceased and Secrets-A moved with purpose at a speed that I now associate all too well with the hidden monsters across dimensions.*

*I stood there in awe of what happened next: witnessing my childhood friend and partner ravage one of the strongest entities I had encountered at that point of my meagre life. Secrets-A grabbed the entity by the leg right as it attempted to jump out of the way. A monster that fast and it still got beat by his speed. The killer's flesh on its snagged leg began to crack, the pure supernatural energy emanating from Secrets-A was enough to physically tear an equally supernatural creature apart. But my enraged colleague wasn't finished there. With a quick spin he lifted our target over his head and slammed it back down into the ground head first. Then he did it again. And again. And again. Again. It was terribly brutal and exhilarating watching that monster start to fall apart with each slam. An arm here...oh look, there goes a leg. What organ is that lying over there? Of course, it was slowly dawning on me that I might not be able to get Secrets-A to calm down and that would be a very big problem.*

*The carnage stopped with our target missing limbs, body broken and twisted, still trying to crawl away with what was left of its remaining arm. Secrets-A walked over to his prey and it was there that I saw a flicker of it. That monster inside of him, the thing from our childhood. It was just a brief afterimage overlaid upon his fuming visage and yet I knew I was looking at pure evil. I was looking at what had taken my best friend from me all those years ago. And you know what? Your ever spooky and threatening Tattle that you've known for years was scared. I was frightened to my very bones of what lurked inside the only person I had ever really cared about.*

*A shot rang out causing my fear to subside and our target to slump to the ground. Hoffer had placed a shot right into its already dented head. Secrets-A stopped and suddenly slumped his shoulders. With his back turned to us I had no idea what emotions played across his face. Were we about to be attacked? I knew we couldn't stop him even if he wanted to. It was even every bit as likely that Hoffer would shoot me in the leg just to escape. Prick.*

*Secrets-A spun around but to my relief it was well within the speed of a normal human. That thing inside him had gone back to sleep. Of course, he was pissed at Hoffer so I was already preparing myself for damage control. I walked over to calm my partner but he brushed me aside and strode right up to Hoffer's face, stared him square in the eye and I still remember what he said: ""I may have monstrous abilities that I can barely control but you're the real fucking monster here. Do that again and I'll rip your fucking leg off and use it to choke the life out of you.""*

*Dear audience, you've got to realize that Hoffer was not a man to be screwed with in my home dimension. He had killed others in the Organization for similar missteps. To my complete and utter surprise he just grunted and left with a quick nod. Come to think of it Oda's funeral was the only one he ever attended. He had come to respect Secrets-A but more importantly he feared him. And anything Hoffer feared was enough to make the coldest and strongest of my world afraid. My Secrets could've been a god, perhaps even the apocalypse of my world and I very much felt like it was up to me to keep him in check.*

*And that’s the tale of the first time Secrets-A and Hoffer met, not to mention the first of several missions the three of us would be sent on. I believe that this was the start of what would eventually bring Hoffer and myself to this Earth.*

*It scares me sometimes how close we are to the end, with every Tale I share I feel a little more exposed, a little more human. I wonder to myself, do I have this right? Am I allowed to feel mortal? I guess we shall see...*

*Until next time.*

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subject: Us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entity: Him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You must be looking for another Tale by now, after all, we only have three left till the end of them, the end of me. This is fine, and I’ll comply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why don’t I tell you about the time that Earth-A Secrets and I hunted down a serial killer back in our own world? Of course we had a little help back then…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the general idea: some being was hunting down women in the outer slums of San Francisco. Kawaisou Town is what they called it. In the world where I come from this area contained slums as far as the eye could see, housing a rather significant Japanese population. They were second-rate citizens displaced after “The Bloody Invasion” from WWII. Quite frankly, I’m sure many from my Earth would have preferred the outcome of your World War Two as opposed to our own, but that’s conversation for a different day perhaps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The being we were hunting was quite similar to the Jack of this Earth. It hunted women, took parts of their bodies, and then fled the scene. From the few witnesses that had seen the being it appeared to be a slim, humanoid creature with inhuman agility. Apparently it could climb walls and leap up buildings with ease. As one of the first missions assigned to Secrets-A I knew we had to call in one more man to help out. He was someone I had worked with before, a real professional, and I wanted him to show Secrets-A the ropes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It wasn’t long before we met up with him, a man you may know as Hoffer. Even back then Hoffer was a go-getter, a real company man, but he wasn’t quite the monster that he is today…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It appears that Hoffer had been tailing our target long before the two of us were assigned to this mission. That was one of the more decidedly odd things about Hoffer, he had this list of entities known only to him and he would simply stalk these beings and observe. I’m not one to talk, but that’s simply not healthy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hoffer described a being that I was quite frankly nervous to expose Secrets-A to. This entity was paranormal in nature, something I already wanted to avoid him being around, I was afraid of anything that would affect his current treatment. The last thing I wanted was for the entity within him to burst forth. That would have been messy. And messy is something neither my superiors nor heart could take. No sir.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hoffer decided that our best course of action would be to lay a trap for the being. I certainly didn’t have any better ideas. I do remember it being a moral issue however. Hoffer wanted to use live bait, an unsuspecting woman, to draw in the monster. I was more than fine with this as well but Secrets-A was having none of it at first. I had to assure him of all the precautions that we would take in order to guarantee the woman’s life. He was such a soft person, despite the malicious being that lay under his skin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the end we decided to have a fellow agent play the part of our unsuspecting female. Hoffer was more than annoyed that we weren’t using someone completely in the dark. He felt that the entity would be able to feel that she was a trap. But, I put down my foot. I wasn’t quite the big deal in O440-A but I had enough clout that he wouldn’t argue with me beyond petty bickering. Plus, it made Secrets-A feel better. An overall win in my little book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So the night of our little hunt began. And guess what? It was a dud. Our killer didn&amp;#39;t take the bait. But we were swathed in persistence so we kept trying. This went on for about a week with little headway and Hoffer and Secrets-A were at each other&amp;#39;s throats the entire time. Those two were entirely different on a fundamental level. It was also a testament to how ballsy Hoffer could be. At this point in time he was little more than an extremely well trained human while Secrets-A positively reeked with paranormal energy that outclassed most of what we came across in my home dimension.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the seventh day we rested. Wait, no, we caught our prey. Sorry, wrong congregation. The entity finally took the bait and chased after our young maiden. Operative Oda knew her stuff however, and deftly led our quarry to the designated spot almost flawlessly. Almost. Unfortunately for our little operation a beleaguered couple happened to be in the splash zone. The entity veered off just short of the target destination in pursuit of new prey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first woman of the pair didn&amp;#39;t even have time to realize her head had been cleaved clean of the body it once was attached too. Her fellow party member sure had enough time to process everything and fall to the ground in a sobbing, screaming heap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The being scrambled over to the decapitated corpse and with a bit of windup proceeded to bury its arm elbow deep in her guts, rooting around for whatever organ it craved. It was then that I got a decent look at our quarry. Here in this dimension the closest thing I could compare it to that you would recognize would be Stalkers, although it lacked the extra arms. It is quite amusing that this entity wouldn&amp;#39;t even be considered a key player in our current dimension, yet it proved quite troublesome to us over in Earth-A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Psuedo-Stalker finished pulling some odd entrail out of the corpse and slurped it down in a manner very reminiscent of a child slurping spaghetti. Without skipping a beat it pounced on the other woman and held her down by the throat, squeezing until each eyeball popped from their respective socket. I remember that at this point Hoffer ordered Oda to get closer and distract the entity while the three of us moved onto its location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oda did as she was told and appeared at the far end of the alley, making as much noise as she could to get the thing&amp;#39;s attention. The beast was having none of this though and after slurping up its second course it looked to jump up to the rooftops and out of our reach where it would probably lay low and choose a new hunting ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sudden shot rang out and Oda fell to the ground clutching her leg. Ah, the Hoffer Special: shoot a limb and make his move. Even back then he was an utter snake. But his methods did get results as our little Stalker wannabe immediately sensed Oda&amp;#39;s weakness and looked to gain a hat trick.

The poor Operative could only look on in horror as the being lifted two long, spindly clawed fingers and entered into her eye sockets, causing two seperate popping noises and her body to begin convulsing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"Falling asleep at night is pretty difficult for me. It's not like I have insomnia or anything but when I lay down I just can't stop myself from thinking. I'll be laying there with my eyes shut, as comfortable as I can get but despite how tired I am, the thoughts keep me up.

 It's never anything important. The darkness I swim in at night becomes populated by “what ifs” and all the ways I could have handled different situations. Things like medicine can help me and I do eventually fall asleep but it is exhausting never getting enough sleep, no matter how early I try. The earlier I get to bed the longer I am just sitting there.

 It has begun affecting my work. I'm more sluggish than I would like to be and I guess the lack of sleep was taking physical shape as well. I caught a quick look of concern from one of my coworkers that prompted me to head to the bathroom. Peering into the mirror under a light that barely lit up the small room I observed the skin under my eyes had begun noticeably darker. Reaching up I pulled at the flesh, it was stretchy and sore.

 Awareness had taken a nosedive as well, I nearly screamed when I opened the door and the same coworker was standing there waiting for me. We were close for work friends. You know the person you hope will be on all the same shifts as you, like when you used to compare what classes you had with your friends in high school. 

 She asked me what was going on and I told her everything that I just told you. She was bubbly, so full of energy every day no matter how early she had to get up. I asked her how she does it, hows she's able to bounce around as she does. After reaching into her pocket to retrieve her phone she showed me an app she had downloaded.

 I was surprised to find this chipper friend of mine had the same problem I did, I felt relieved in a way that I wasn't alone. With her fingers pressing the screen she explained to me that her doctor suggested the app. It was one of those sleep-aid apps, the ones that will loop white noise or even, as my friend recommended, tell you a story.

 She claimed that once the man begins his stories, it was like his voice was less taxing to focus on and it helped her to silence that chaotic switching of channels that she experienced before. I downloaded the app right away and told her that I was excited to give it a try. And I was, if something as simple as an app could help me get some meaningful sleep I was absolutely all for it.

 So the day progressed and the sun retreated beyond the horizon. I went through my usual routine of nonsense to pass the time until I felt tired enough to lumber off to bed. Somehow I had almost forgotten about the app by the time I set my head down on the pillow but it wasn't long before my head became noisy and I was reminded.

 Stretching my hand out I gripped the phone laying next to my bed, it was cool to the touch from the night's advancing air. With my eyes squinting I navigated to the app and then through the selection of offerings it had. There was only one “Story” that was available on the free app, but hell if it worked I would gladly have dropped some money on it. The story was titled “By the fire.”

 I clicked it and lowered the volume. The first thing I heard was the soft crackling of a fire, I could almost envision the sparks popping into a dark sky. There was a soft breezing behind the fires licking flames, I could hear it rustling trees around and then his voice gently became audible, it was like he was coming up behind me but didn't want to scare me so he keeps his voice soft.

 “Hello there.” He spoke. “I'm so glad you could join me for tonight's tale.” His voice was low and a little gruff but it kept a very comfortable calm. The kinda voice you'd expect from a seasoned captain on an old shanty boat. It felt soothing.

 “You don't have to think about anything, just allow me to whisk you away to parts unknown. All me to fill your room, with the crevices of your imagination.” He continued speaking as he moved into a story about a woman who lived alone. I guessed that “By the fire” was more of an indication for the ambiance side of things instead of the actual content of the story. It didn't matter to me what the story was though, I was hardly listening to it.

 My coworker was absolutely right! As his words filled my head, even though I wasn't paying attention to what was being said, it pushed out all other thoughts. It was like the external source of the noise was easier to either ignore or process. I wondered if she actually listened to the stories. Either way, the spell was taking an effect on me. I could feel my breath slowing down and my body becoming more relaxed than it had been for weeks.

 Absentmindedly I began to drift off, I wasn't even thinking about how incredible that was for me, I wasn't thinking about anything. “Your room is dark, filled more with moonlight than anything else. You begin to drift off to sleep.” As I was crossing the threshold into true slumber the man's voice seemed to redeem clarity in my mind. “But you are stirred when you feel a pressure on the end of your bed.”

The words were, of course, odd to me. And my mind started to wander again, not because of what the man said specifically but- because I could feel the end of my bed, dipping down.

 “Quickly you sit up in bed, fear pulling you like a puppet.” Quickly I sat, my heart was beating quickly as I looked around the dark room and I discovered that I was alone. For a good few minutes, I sat still trying to gather myself, peering at any dark corner until the shapes became define.

After a while I paid attention to the story again, the man was going on about something completely unrelated. A farmer or something, like a new story, had started. I know it sounds silly but I took this as confirmation that the app worked. I figured all that happened was I got one of those vivid dreams and suddenly woke up in a panic. 

 I laid back down and before long I drifted off to sleep again and without incident, I remained in bed until the morning crept through the window ushering away the darkness. I felt, incredible. One good night of sleep cant undo months of terrible rest but it was a damn good start. I made certain to sing praises to my friend all day at work.

 During my break, I purchased the premium version of the app and sifted through all the potential stories. They were all different types of background noise. Running water. Chirping bugs and even a still room.

That night I loaded up the app again and clicked on the still room option. It was mostly quiet but now and then you could hear a car driving in the distance. It felt so real like I couldn't tell if it was the app or outside my window. “Hello again. Glad to have you back.” The man's voice was as calm as ever but a little clearer without much background noise.

 I closed my eyes and got ready to get some more sleep, excited to wake up with enough energy to just jump out of bed. “I want to tell you a story about an animal.” My lips lifted into a smile, I love stories about adventurous animals. I mean who doesn't love homeward bound? I thought that I would be paying attention to this story.

 “This animal is unlike any other. It's fast and nimble yet, so very powerful.” My mind wandered to pictures of large cats. Powerful lions and quick cheetahs. “This animal has no predator and everything below it is prey.” I felt myself tremble for a moment, blankets ruffling with my movements. 

 “It's never satisfied, always searching for something else to snack on. Looking for the next person to mangel between its piercing fangs.” My eyes shot open and I peered at the phone feeling my face twist into a scowl. The narration died down, I listened close to the phone as a beam of light-filled my room, a passing car. And as the car passed, I could hear in the app, a car passing as well.

Swallowing the lump in my throat I waited for the man to speak up again, even leaning in to try and catch more background noise. I heard a soft but ragged breath coming from my phone's speakers. It didn't sound like it was coming from some seasoned boat captain. It sounded exactly like it was coming from me. My breathing was coming from the app.

 Something in my brain took over, curiosity or sleep deprivation I don't know but I moved my fingers to my bedside table and tapped it with my fingernails. And sure enough, from within the app, I heard tap tap tap. I had enough, still hoping I was asleep and far too confused to continue pushing my luck I reached forward to turn the phone off.

 “Once this creature sets its eyes on you,” My fingers stopped just shy of closing the app, the phone once again sat cold in my hand. “It will hunt until it has its fill.” As those words beamed to life I once again felt a pressure on my bed. This time it felt like someone had just laid down beside me on the bed. Something, large and heavy pressuring the mattress nearly causing me to spill over to it.

 “If there was anything that can be done about this ancient creation, it would have surely been done by now.” It was almost like the voice was digging into my head and searching through my thoughts as I desperately considered ways to get out of whatever the hell I was in. I could feel a hot huff of breath waft against the back of my neck. 

 Whatever mouth produced it was massive, it felt like someone had flicked a fan quickly on and off. I wanted to just close the app, I couldn't decide if it would help or hurt though, I had no idea what I had gotten into or how to handle it. I would have much rather deal with the insistent nagging of my inner thoughts for the rest of my life than feel even a tenth of the fear I was feeling, ever again.

 My eyes stayed focused on the phone like I was waiting for instruction, the last thing I wanted to do was get a good look at whatever was behind me. I could vaguely see it reflected on my phone screen. A dark mass the seemed to stretch up to the ceiling, I couldn't imagine how I could ever have missed something that large entering my room.

 There was a low murmur too it like just breathing was producing an intimidating growl from the behemoth. I wish to god, that I would have just wakened up, that at any point my eyes would have opened and I'd be greeted with the sunlight. But that's not what happened. I sat still all night as my mind emptied with each passing moment, all I could think about was the monster behind me. It felt like the thing was sucking away all the thoughts that used to plague me, feeding on them.

 “And once it gets it's fill...” The narration trailed off, and from the speakers, on my phone, I could hear an ear-piercing scream. It filled the room getting louder and louder, echoing until I realized my mouth had long been opened wide, my own shrill cries crawling out from the open cavity. My shoulder was hot white, a tingling burn that I never felt before.

 “It will take a piece, so you can never forget it, so it can return another day.” My arm bent backward, powerful vice-like digits wrapping around my forearm nearly crushing the bone with nothing but just the strength of its grip. My arm was wrought it an intense pain that sent me spiraling into unconsciousness and back again. My body pumping adrenaline like a junkie, I prayed that shock would take me, that I would find reprieval from the agony.

 I felt every bit of it though, until all that was left, was nothing. My arm had been pulled and twisted, bones cracked and skin split open, it was mangled until it freed from my back. Splitting apart right at the bicep, what little muscle I had tried to hold together far longer than I would have wanted it to. Every extra second of helplessness was an eternity of anguish.

 The pressure that was once on the bed vanished and I was left alone, my screams died down and the heat my body had created dissipated. I laid all night, face soaked in my tears and the memories of my pain still painted in my mind. I know that whatever that thing was had torn my arm right off my body, I could feel every moment of it. 

 So I was confused when my arm tapped against the bed, laying limp, still connected to my body like nothing had ever happened. The pain, I know it was real, it was unending, I can't stop thinking about that pain or about that creature. And that's exactly what it wants. “I hope you'll join me for a story tomorrow night.” The soothing voice rang out again. “Because if you don't, it won't give back what it's taken next time.” 

 The story ended. A penny for your thoughts and a pound of flesh. The Thing, was full. It's the same thing every night. It's a looping hell. I've tried so many things. I'm too afraid to delete the app but I've tried sleeping during the day. I can do it, sort of. I've nothing I don't think about things anymore. Anything I find my mind becoming cluttered with thoughts again that thing visits me and night and eats all that it can.

 Making damn sure to put me through whatever pain it can push on me. I've felt my chest ripped open with jagged and dirty fingernails. My limps torn off one by one and my body crushed under an indescribable weight. I'm always reset back to zero though, it always gives back what it's taken and reverses the damage it's done. 

 I think-

&amp;#x200B;

 I think it doesn't feed off my pain or my flesh. It just needs me to remember it, it needs to be in my thoughts so it can visit again. But anything short of a lobotomy, I'll never be able to force myself to forget that thing or what it puts me through. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Some nights it doesn't come. Some nights the app is just an app that tells regular stories to help me sleep, but I never can. My mind isn't busy shifting from one thought to the next anymore though, it's always stuck on that thing. Always imagining what it looks like, what ghastly form it takes because I refuse to look. I won't give it that. I won't give it a final form in my head.

I just want one goddamn night of [good rest.](https://twitter.com/Author_jo_jo)",t2_x9wnm,False,,0,False,Be careful when using Sleep-aid Apps.,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgmd6u,False,dark,,public,64,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,64,,False,,1583879685.0,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583907902.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling asleep at night is pretty difficult for me. It&amp;#39;s not like I have insomnia or anything but when I lay down I just can&amp;#39;t stop myself from thinking. I&amp;#39;ll be laying there with my eyes shut, as comfortable as I can get but despite how tired I am, the thoughts keep me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It&amp;#39;s never anything important. The darkness I swim in at night becomes populated by “what ifs” and all the ways I could have handled different situations. Things like medicine can help me and I do eventually fall asleep but it is exhausting never getting enough sleep, no matter how early I try. The earlier I get to bed the longer I am just sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It has begun affecting my work. I&amp;#39;m more sluggish than I would like to be and I guess the lack of sleep was taking physical shape as well. I caught a quick look of concern from one of my coworkers that prompted me to head to the bathroom. Peering into the mirror under a light that barely lit up the small room I observed the skin under my eyes had begun noticeably darker. Reaching up I pulled at the flesh, it was stretchy and sore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Awareness had taken a nosedive as well, I nearly screamed when I opened the door and the same coworker was standing there waiting for me. We were close for work friends. You know the person you hope will be on all the same shifts as you, like when you used to compare what classes you had with your friends in high school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; She asked me what was going on and I told her everything that I just told you. She was bubbly, so full of energy every day no matter how early she had to get up. I asked her how she does it, hows she&amp;#39;s able to bounce around as she does. After reaching into her pocket to retrieve her phone she showed me an app she had downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I was surprised to find this chipper friend of mine had the same problem I did, I felt relieved in a way that I wasn&amp;#39;t alone. With her fingers pressing the screen she explained to me that her doctor suggested the app. It was one of those sleep-aid apps, the ones that will loop white noise or even, as my friend recommended, tell you a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; She claimed that once the man begins his stories, it was like his voice was less taxing to focus on and it helped her to silence that chaotic switching of channels that she experienced before. I downloaded the app right away and told her that I was excited to give it a try. And I was, if something as simple as an app could help me get some meaningful sleep I was absolutely all for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So the day progressed and the sun retreated beyond the horizon. I went through my usual routine of nonsense to pass the time until I felt tired enough to lumber off to bed. Somehow I had almost forgotten about the app by the time I set my head down on the pillow but it wasn&amp;#39;t long before my head became noisy and I was reminded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Stretching my hand out I gripped the phone laying next to my bed, it was cool to the touch from the night&amp;#39;s advancing air. With my eyes squinting I navigated to the app and then through the selection of offerings it had. There was only one “Story” that was available on the free app, but hell if it worked I would gladly have dropped some money on it. The story was titled “By the fire.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I clicked it and lowered the volume. The first thing I heard was the soft crackling of a fire, I could almost envision the sparks popping into a dark sky. There was a soft breezing behind the fires licking flames, I could hear it rustling trees around and then his voice gently became audible, it was like he was coming up behind me but didn&amp;#39;t want to scare me so he keeps his voice soft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “Hello there.” He spoke. “I&amp;#39;m so glad you could join me for tonight&amp;#39;s tale.” His voice was low and a little gruff but it kept a very comfortable calm. The kinda voice you&amp;#39;d expect from a seasoned captain on an old shanty boat. It felt soothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “You don&amp;#39;t have to think about anything, just allow me to whisk you away to parts unknown. All me to fill your room, with the crevices of your imagination.” He continued speaking as he moved into a story about a woman who lived alone. I guessed that “By the fire” was more of an indication for the ambiance side of things instead of the actual content of the story. It didn&amp;#39;t matter to me what the story was though, I was hardly listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; My coworker was absolutely right! As his words filled my head, even though I wasn&amp;#39;t paying attention to what was being said, it pushed out all other thoughts. It was like the external source of the noise was easier to either ignore or process. I wondered if she actually listened to the stories. Either way, the spell was taking an effect on me. I could feel my breath slowing down and my body becoming more relaxed than it had been for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Absentmindedly I began to drift off, I wasn&amp;#39;t even thinking about how incredible that was for me, I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about anything. “Your room is dark, filled more with moonlight than anything else. You begin to drift off to sleep.” As I was crossing the threshold into true slumber the man&amp;#39;s voice seemed to redeem clarity in my mind. “But you are stirred when you feel a pressure on the end of your bed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words were, of course, odd to me. And my mind started to wander again, not because of what the man said specifically but- because I could feel the end of my bed, dipping down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “Quickly you sit up in bed, fear pulling you like a puppet.” Quickly I sat, my heart was beating quickly as I looked around the dark room and I discovered that I was alone. For a good few minutes, I sat still trying to gather myself, peering at any dark corner until the shapes became define.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while I paid attention to the story again, the man was going on about something completely unrelated. A farmer or something, like a new story, had started. I know it sounds silly but I took this as confirmation that the app worked. I figured all that happened was I got one of those vivid dreams and suddenly woke up in a panic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I laid back down and before long I drifted off to sleep again and without incident, I remained in bed until the morning crept through the window ushering away the darkness. I felt, incredible. One good night of sleep cant undo months of terrible rest but it was a damn good start. I made certain to sing praises to my friend all day at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; During my break, I purchased the premium version of the app and sifted through all the potential stories. They were all different types of background noise. Running water. Chirping bugs and even a still room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night I loaded up the app again and clicked on the still room option. It was mostly quiet but now and then you could hear a car driving in the distance. It felt so real like I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if it was the app or outside my window. “Hello again. Glad to have you back.” The man&amp;#39;s voice was as calm as ever but a little clearer without much background noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I closed my eyes and got ready to get some more sleep, excited to wake up with enough energy to just jump out of bed. “I want to tell you a story about an animal.” My lips lifted into a smile, I love stories about adventurous animals. I mean who doesn&amp;#39;t love homeward bound? I thought that I would be paying attention to this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “This animal is unlike any other. It&amp;#39;s fast and nimble yet, so very powerful.” My mind wandered to pictures of large cats. Powerful lions and quick cheetahs. “This animal has no predator and everything below it is prey.” I felt myself tremble for a moment, blankets ruffling with my movements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “It&amp;#39;s never satisfied, always searching for something else to snack on. Looking for the next person to mangel between its piercing fangs.” My eyes shot open and I peered at the phone feeling my face twist into a scowl. The narration died down, I listened close to the phone as a beam of light-filled my room, a passing car. And as the car passed, I could hear in the app, a car passing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swallowing the lump in my throat I waited for the man to speak up again, even leaning in to try and catch more background noise. I heard a soft but ragged breath coming from my phone&amp;#39;s speakers. It didn&amp;#39;t sound like it was coming from some seasoned boat captain. It sounded exactly like it was coming from me. My breathing was coming from the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Something in my brain took over, curiosity or sleep deprivation I don&amp;#39;t know but I moved my fingers to my bedside table and tapped it with my fingernails. And sure enough, from within the app, I heard tap tap tap. I had enough, still hoping I was asleep and far too confused to continue pushing my luck I reached forward to turn the phone off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “Once this creature sets its eyes on you,” My fingers stopped just shy of closing the app, the phone once again sat cold in my hand. “It will hunt until it has its fill.” As those words beamed to life I once again felt a pressure on my bed. This time it felt like someone had just laid down beside me on the bed. Something, large and heavy pressuring the mattress nearly causing me to spill over to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “If there was anything that can be done about this ancient creation, it would have surely been done by now.” It was almost like the voice was digging into my head and searching through my thoughts as I desperately considered ways to get out of whatever the hell I was in. I could feel a hot huff of breath waft against the back of my neck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Whatever mouth produced it was massive, it felt like someone had flicked a fan quickly on and off. I wanted to just close the app, I couldn&amp;#39;t decide if it would help or hurt though, I had no idea what I had gotten into or how to handle it. I would have much rather deal with the insistent nagging of my inner thoughts for the rest of my life than feel even a tenth of the fear I was feeling, ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; My eyes stayed focused on the phone like I was waiting for instruction, the last thing I wanted to do was get a good look at whatever was behind me. I could vaguely see it reflected on my phone screen. A dark mass the seemed to stretch up to the ceiling, I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine how I could ever have missed something that large entering my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There was a low murmur too it like just breathing was producing an intimidating growl from the behemoth. I wish to god, that I would have just wakened up, that at any point my eyes would have opened and I&amp;#39;d be greeted with the sunlight. But that&amp;#39;s not what happened. I sat still all night as my mind emptied with each passing moment, all I could think about was the monster behind me. It felt like the thing was sucking away all the thoughts that used to plague me, feeding on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “And once it gets it&amp;#39;s fill...” The narration trailed off, and from the speakers, on my phone, I could hear an ear-piercing scream. It filled the room getting louder and louder, echoing until I realized my mouth had long been opened wide, my own shrill cries crawling out from the open cavity. My shoulder was hot white, a tingling burn that I never felt before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “It will take a piece, so you can never forget it, so it can return another day.” My arm bent backward, powerful vice-like digits wrapping around my forearm nearly crushing the bone with nothing but just the strength of its grip. My arm was wrought it an intense pain that sent me spiraling into unconsciousness and back again. My body pumping adrenaline like a junkie, I prayed that shock would take me, that I would find reprieval from the agony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I felt every bit of it though, until all that was left, was nothing. My arm had been pulled and twisted, bones cracked and skin split open, it was mangled until it freed from my back. Splitting apart right at the bicep, what little muscle I had tried to hold together far longer than I would have wanted it to.

I&amp;#39;ve tried so many things. I&amp;#39;m too afraid to delete the app but I&amp;#39;ve tried sleeping during the day. I can do it, sort of. I&amp;#39;ve nothing I don&amp;#39;t think about things anymore. Anything I find my mind becoming cluttered with thoughts again that thing visits me and night and eats all that it can.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I’m a commuter, that’s the only way you can get a job and a place to live in Toronto. I won’t lie. The drive is bullshit but I could be worse off. I could not have a job at all and the drive is preferable to that. I get paid well and I honestly do love my job. The drive is the only thing I’ve got to bitch about and it’s honestly not that bad.

&amp;#x200B;

The traffic getting out of Toronto is nothing short of bullshit though and when I’m stuck in it I get bored. Sometimes, I look at the cars around me. It’s kinda like people watching. You can learn a lot about some people by looking at their car.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever thought about doing that before? Picking a random car and following it to its destination? It’s creepy, I know. But who knows what kind of life that stranger lives. Would they notice they were being followed? Would they call you out on it? Hard to say for sure, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, the car in front of me was a Nissan Rogue. It was a newer model. My Brother has a 2008, and this looked almost identical to that. It had a dark brown color and whoever owned it had put the name *‘Veronika’* on the back. Nothing all that special honestly. People had done weirder shit with their vehicles. I saw a guy with a sexy pirate girl dominating one side of his car. I thought it was for a company or something but nope. He just randomly had a sexy pirate girl on the side of his car.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the Nissan though. By itself, it wasn’t anything special. I wasn’t even on the highway yet when I ended up behind it. I was on a crowded street, trying to make it to the on ramp for the highway. Still, as I sat behind that car I tried to catch a glimpse inside to alleviate my own boredom. I probably wouldn’t have remembered the details normally but the longer I sat in traffic behind that car, the more I started to notice the movement inside of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I dismissed it as some rowdy passengers in the back, or an anxious family pet at first. It was just rapid movement darting between the seats. But the longer I watched, the less certain I was that it was either of those things. The way the shapes curved didn't seem to match the way people's arms moved and it didn’t seem to move like an animal. An animal would pace and would seem like more of a solid shape. Not a flailing mass.

&amp;#x200B;

I got tunnel vision, fascinated by what was inside this car. I watched it as intently as I could despite the traffic. The Nissan never changed lanes or moved significantly and I stayed close enough behind that no one could really get in between us. No matter what I thought up, I couldn’t determine just what the fuck was in the back of that car and it was driving me absolutely wild! It wasn’t until I’d already passed it that I realized my turn onto the highway was coming up. I swore under my breath a little, but honestly I wasn’t all that bothered. Whatever was in the car ahead of me had my undivided attention and I honestly wanted to follow it further, just to see where it went.

&amp;#x200B;

For the next hour or so, not much happened. I sat in traffic with that strange car in front of me and the longer I looked, the more I was puzzled by the mystery in front of me. It was honestly kinda hard not to be interested in it! However the traffic was gradually thinning out now that rush hour was over and we were getting closer and closer to the edge of town.

&amp;#x200B;

If you’ve never been to Toronto, the urban sprawl mostly grows like mold along the highways and the lakeshore. If you head east, it extends along the 403 all the way out towards Hamilton and only after that does it start to die out. Past the 403, there’s a more rural patch between that and Highway 401 and once you’re over the 401 it’s all farmland. Well, this car was headed straight for that farmland from the looks of it. It made some turns once the traffic started to thin out and headed northeast.

&amp;#x200B;

I barely noticed the landscape slowly changing from suburbs and strip malls to narrow backroads, fields and trees. The sky was getting darker and the car kept moving. As the light from the sky faded, I saw less and less of the movement in the back seat but my attention was still captured. I had to see where this car was going.

&amp;#x200B;

I vaguely recall having a few thoughts to the tune of: *‘What the fuck am I doing?.* Outright stalking someone wasn’t my usual after work hobby. I should’ve been at a fast food restaurant grabbing a burger or at home watching TV. But despite telling myself that I just needed to turn around and go home, I found that I couldn’t. Something made me stay behind that car. Something made me squint at its rear window, hoping to catch some glimpse of the thing in the back seat.

&amp;#x200B;

The sky went pitch black as night fell. We’d been driving for almost two hours at that point. It was a little after seven in the evening. I could see the faint outline of trees in the darkness ahead and had to do a double take. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks in the darkness, but I could’ve sworn there was something above the trees. Shifting shapes that twisted and coiled in the sky. I thought I heard a crash of thunder but it didn’t seem to be storming. Not yet at least.

&amp;#x200B;

The car ahead of me had sped up a little. The paint that made up the lines in the road was faded and they were nearly invisible. I was moreso following the taillights of the Nissan ahead of me than I was actually following the road.

&amp;#x200B;

We disappeared past the treeline, which blanketed us in an even deeper darkness. The Nissan ahead of me slowly got further and further away. I upped my speed to keep up with it. It was only a few moments later that I felt my car jerk as we left the pavement and wound up on a gravel road. The gravel had less traction and my speeding car almost lost control. I had to fight to get it back.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like I was lost in the middle of a void. I couldn’t even see the trees around me anymore. My car radio had gone dead silent and I realized I couldn’t remember when it had shut off. I glanced at it and I didn’t even see a time being displayed. The world was pitch black. The only light was the taillights of the Nissan and for the first time I felt my heart racing. The familiar sinking sensation of dread blossomed in my gut like a weed. How long had we been driving? Two hours? Three? Six? Twelve?

&amp;#x200B;

Something felt very, very wrong. Every instinct I had told me to turn around but for some stupid reason, I brushed all of my concerns aside. Everything would be fine. I just needed to follow and soon I would get my answer.

&amp;#x200B;

When the Nissan stopped, so did I. I was a good fifty feet away, but I could see the drivers side door of the vehicle opening. I sat there, watching in suspense as the driver of the car stepped out.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I could see, he was an old bastard. Somewhere in his eighties or nineties and he was about as thin as they got. I was sure the wind would blow him over. He was clearly balding but still grew what little hair he had left out long. Even from the distance I was at, I could see his liver spots. He wore a very loose fitting suit that should have fit someone else, a lot younger and taller than him.

&amp;#x200B;

He shuffled out of the car and looked over at me. It was just a glance but that glance said everything. He made it very clear that he knew I’d been following him. His face betrayed nothing. It was just a single, stern expression. I watched him make his way to the back of the car and opened up the trunk. I stepped out of my car, leaving it running as the back gate of the Nissan swung open.

&amp;#x200B;

The Old Man blocked my view of whatever was inside, but I could see parts of it around him. Long, sticky tendrils clung to the sides of the car. I could see things that almost looked like tentacles swaying gently. The Old Man looked back at me again, his expression stern yet sorrowful. He didn’t speak. But there was a question on his lips. Something he needed to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

*“Are you sure you’re ready?”*

&amp;#x200B;

My answer was yes, but that wasn’t the truth. Not really. Honestly, I don’t know if I could ever be ready to see what was in that car. I continued my slow advance, eyes fixated on the unidentifiable shape behind the man. I only glanced at him once. I remember noticing how

&amp;#x200B;

When I was just a few feet away from him, he closed his eyes and exhaled. Slowly, he shuffled out of the way and I saw. Oh yes. I saw everything.

&amp;#x200B;

“You followed,” The Old Man said. His voice was weak and raspy. “It’s yours now…”

&amp;#x200B;

He sighed and turned away from me as I reached out to the thing in the car. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it… It was beautiful and horrible all at once. It was so cold to the touch, and yet soft.  Reverently, I lifted it out of the back of his Nissan and cradled it close to my chest. I admired it, then looked up at the Old Man one last time. I saw him sprawled out on the ground a few feet away from me. I knew he was dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly, I took my prize back to my car. I set it in my back seat where it would be comfortable, then I got behind the wheel again. It felt good being behind the wheel.

&amp;#x200B;

I began to drive, going around the stopped Nissan and onto the road ahead. The Nissan and its dead driver were soon far away in my rearview mirror as I drove onwards into the dark. I looked back at the thing in my backseat a few times. I thought about going home but… no… My new passenger didn’t want to go home with me. My new passenger wanted to drive. So we drove. We drove until the sun came up and we will continue to drive. It’s funny… I would’ve thought my car would have run out of gas by now, or that I’d feel tired or hungry but I don’t. Not really.

I saw a few more lines in my face when I looked in the rearview mirror this morning though and I think I spotted some gray hairs this morning as well. Oh well. I’m not concerned. I’m still only 22. There’s still a lot of miles in me yet.

[I should get back to driving though. My Passenger doesn’t like to be kept waiting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)",t2_2jhmpsgt,False,,0,False,"If You See A Car With Something Inhuman In The Back Seat, Don't Follow It",[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgfkfz,False,dark,,public,202,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,202,,True,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583882962.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a commuter, that’s the only way you can get a job and a place to live in Toronto. I won’t lie. The drive is bullshit but I could be worse off. I could not have a job at all and the drive is preferable to that. I get paid well and I honestly do love my job. The drive is the only thing I’ve got to bitch about and it’s honestly not that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traffic getting out of Toronto is nothing short of bullshit though and when I’m stuck in it I get bored. Sometimes, I look at the cars around me. It’s kinda like people watching. You can learn a lot about some people by looking at their car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about doing that before? Picking a random car and following it to its destination? It’s creepy, I know. But who knows what kind of life that stranger lives. Would they notice they were being followed? Would they call you out on it? Hard to say for sure, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, the car in front of me was a Nissan Rogue. It was a newer model. My Brother has a 2008, and this looked almost identical to that. It had a dark brown color and whoever owned it had put the name &lt;em&gt;‘Veronika’&lt;/em&gt; on the back. Nothing all that special honestly. People had done weirder shit with their vehicles. I saw a guy with a sexy pirate girl dominating one side of his car. I thought it was for a company or something but nope. He just randomly had a sexy pirate girl on the side of his car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the Nissan though. By itself, it wasn’t anything special. I wasn’t even on the highway yet when I ended up behind it. I was on a crowded street, trying to make it to the on ramp for the highway. Still, as I sat behind that car I tried to catch a glimpse inside to alleviate my own boredom. I probably wouldn’t have remembered the details normally but the longer I sat in traffic behind that car, the more I started to notice the movement inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dismissed it as some rowdy passengers in the back, or an anxious family pet at first. It was just rapid movement darting between the seats. But the longer I watched, the less certain I was that it was either of those things. The way the shapes curved didn&amp;#39;t seem to match the way people&amp;#39;s arms moved and it didn’t seem to move like an animal. An animal would pace and would seem like more of a solid shape. Not a flailing mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got tunnel vision, fascinated by what was inside this car. I watched it as intently as I could despite the traffic. The Nissan never changed lanes or moved significantly and I stayed close enough behind that no one could really get in between us. No matter what I thought up, I couldn’t determine just what the fuck was in the back of that car and it was driving me absolutely wild! It wasn’t until I’d already passed it that I realized my turn onto the highway was coming up. I swore under my breath a little, but honestly I wasn’t all that bothered. Whatever was in the car ahead of me had my undivided attention and I honestly wanted to follow it further, just to see where it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next hour or so, not much happened. I sat in traffic with that strange car in front of me and the longer I looked, the more I was puzzled by the mystery in front of me. It was honestly kinda hard not to be interested in it! However the traffic was gradually thinning out now that rush hour was over and we were getting closer and closer to the edge of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never been to Toronto, the urban sprawl mostly grows like mold along the highways and the lakeshore. If you head east, it extends along the 403 all the way out towards Hamilton and only after that does it start to die out. Past the 403, there’s a more rural patch between that and Highway 401 and once you’re over the 401 it’s all farmland. Well, this car was headed straight for that farmland from the looks of it. It made some turns once the traffic started to thin out and headed northeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I barely noticed the landscape slowly changing from suburbs and strip malls to narrow backroads, fields and trees. The sky was getting darker and the car kept moving. As the light from the sky faded, I saw less and less of the movement in the back seat but my attention was still captured. I had to see where this car was going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vaguely recall having a few thoughts to the tune of: &lt;em&gt;‘What the fuck am I doing?.&lt;/em&gt; Outright stalking someone wasn’t my usual after work hobby. I should’ve been at a fast food restaurant grabbing a burger or at home watching TV. But despite telling myself that I just needed to turn around and go home, I found that I couldn’t. Something made me stay behind that car. Something made me squint at its rear window, hoping to catch some glimpse of the thing in the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sky went pitch black as night fell. We’d been driving for almost two hours at that point. It was a little after seven in the evening. I could see the faint outline of trees in the darkness ahead and had to do a double take. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks in the darkness, but I could’ve sworn there was something above the trees. Shifting shapes that twisted and coiled in the sky. I thought I heard a crash of thunder but it didn’t seem to be storming. Not yet at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car ahead of me had sped up a little. The paint that made up the lines in the road was faded and they were nearly invisible. I was moreso following the taillights of the Nissan ahead of me than I was actually following the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We disappeared past the treeline, which blanketed us in an even deeper darkness. The Nissan ahead of me slowly got further and further away. I upped my speed to keep up with it. It was only a few moments later that I felt my car jerk as we left the pavement and wound up on a gravel road. The gravel had less traction and my speeding car almost lost control. I had to fight to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was lost in the middle of a void. I couldn’t even see the trees around me anymore. My car radio had gone dead silent and I realized I couldn’t remember when it had shut off. I glanced at it and I didn’t even see a time being displayed. The world was pitch black. The only light was the taillights of the Nissan and for the first time I felt my heart racing. The familiar sinking sensation of dread blossomed in my gut like a weed. How long had we been driving? Two hours? Three? Six? Twelve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something felt very, very wrong. Every instinct I had told me to turn around but for some stupid reason, I brushed all of my concerns aside. Everything would be fine. I just needed to follow and soon I would get my answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Nissan stopped, so did I. I was a good fifty feet away, but I could see the drivers side door of the vehicle opening. I sat there, watching in suspense as the driver of the car stepped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I could see, he was an old bastard. Somewhere in his eighties or nineties and he was about as thin as they got. I was sure the wind would blow him over. He was clearly balding but still grew what little hair he had left out long. Even from the distance I was at, I could see his liver spots. He wore a very loose fitting suit that should have fit someone else, a lot younger and taller than him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shuffled out of the car and looked over at me. It was just a glance but that glance said everything. He made it very clear that he knew I’d been following him. His face betrayed nothing. It was just a single, stern expression. I watched him make his way to the back of the car and opened up the trunk. I stepped out of my car, leaving it running as the back gate of the Nissan swung open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Man blocked my view of whatever was inside, but I could see parts of it around him. Long, sticky tendrils clung to the sides of the car. I could see things that almost looked like tentacles swaying gently. The Old Man looked back at me again, his expression stern yet sorrowful. He didn’t speak. But there was a question on his lips. Something he needed to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Are you sure you’re ready?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer was yes, but that wasn’t the truth. Not really. Honestly, I don’t know if I could ever be ready to see what was in that car. I continued my slow advance, eyes fixated on the unidentifiable shape behind the man. I only glanced at him once. I remember noticing how&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was just a few feet away from him, he closed his eyes and exhaled. Slowly, he shuffled out of the way and I saw. Oh yes. I saw everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You followed,” The Old Man said. His voice was weak and raspy. “It’s yours now…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sighed and turned away from me as I reached out to the thing in the car. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it… It was beautiful and horrible all at once. It was so cold to the touch, and yet soft.  Reverently, I lifted it out of the back of his Nissan and cradled it close to my chest. I admired it, then looked up at the Old Man one last time. I saw him sprawled out on the ground a few feet away from me. I knew he was dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, I took my prize back to my car. I set it in my back seat where it would be comfortable, then I got behind the wheel again. It felt good being behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to drive, going around the stopped Nissan and onto the road ahead. The Nissan and its dead driver were soon far away in my rearview mirror as I drove onwards into the dark. I looked back at the thing in my backseat a few times. I thought about going home but… no… My new passenger didn’t want to go home with me. My new passenger wanted to drive. So we drove. We drove until the sun came up and we will continue to drive. It’s funny… I would’ve thought my car would have run out of gas by now, or that I’d feel tired or hungry but I don’t. Not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a few more lines in my face when I looked in the rearview mirror this morning though and I think I spotted some gray hairs this morning as well. Oh well. I’m not concerned. I’m still only 22. There’s still a lot of miles in me yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I guess my childhood was OK, for the most part. My parents divorced. I got into a few scrapes here and there. Friendships came and went, and I spent way too long on my XBox. Looking back, I try to 'accentuate the positive', as annoying people might put it. But there was that one moment I still have never been able to forget. And it's coming back for all the wrong reasons.

We were six or seven, and it was mid-July. The Infant School was getting close to the start of the Summer Holidays, and we were as impatient as kids would be. Still, it was Thursday, and that meant BBC Schools for Children.

We all sat on the floor in front of the big screen TV wheeled in front of us by the teacher. Schools programming was a dull affair, of course, but we at least didn't have to do much but watch the telly. I remember an odd sense of peace as the curtains were drawn and the lights were turned off. 

The TV show was pretty standard - a cheery presenter and some animations talking about the Normans, some polite references to cesspits, the Plantagenets... I liked history, so I was engaged, so to speak. Some kids had fallen asleep, but that was Thursday afternoon.

And then, all of a sudden, the screen went dark, and out came a puppet. It looked like a cheapskate British attempt to knock together a Sesame Street muppet. But there was a sad, forlorn quality to the fuzzy, big-eyed thing that was all its own. The class all started paying much more attention at this point. Only later did I realise our teacher was strangely still, and vacant eyed, as if in a trance...

The puppet began to speak in a funny, squeaky voice, that nonetheless had a strange depth to it. ""Hello Children"", it said. ""Are you all sitting comfortably?""

Some kids shouted 'Yes', others nodded (quite why, I don't know), while others like me just stared.

""Thank you"", the puppet said, 'clearing' its throat. ""I'm really sorry, but I have to tell you some bad news. You're all going to die young, And I know how you'll go. I can't change it. But I can help you... prepare.""

Some of the kids, not surprisingly, started to cry. Our teacher remained in her trance. The rest of us just sat there, mesmerised.

""OK"", the puppet said. ""I guess I should begin with the ones... first to go."" The fuzzy, cloth thing sighed, looked down, but then returned to its duties.

He called out the first child, told them they would die in a road accident three weeks from now. He even told them what car they were going to be hit by, when and how long it would take them to die. But he also told them that their parents loved them very much, and that their brothers and sisters would miss them, and they would never be forgotten.

The next child; she was going to get meningitis a year later. It would be quick, and relatively painless. The puppet didn't mention her family, apart from her grandfather, and said that he loved her more than anything.

And on it went. Each kid told when and how they would die, and given a small crumb of comfort. One kid was told their dog would never forget them, or their guinea pigs. Another was told that the Lollipop Lady would mourn them for the rest of their days. Imagine that. Knowing your so-called family would 'move on', or get caught up in their own nonsense, leaving only a stranger to cry for you. But... it was enough. To know that you were loved, regardless.

Most of us were crying at the end, but it was strange, as if we were all resigned to our fates, knowing that one way or another it would be... alright.

And suddenly the schools programmes were back on the screen, and the teacher was out of her trance. We'd dried our eyes by then, though she probably wondered why we were all so quiet.

We broke up for the holidays, and the first death unfolded just as the puppet foretold. And then the second death, the third death, the fourth...

We stayed in touch after school, keeping each other updated, supporting the next to die. No matter how hard we tried, our deaths could never be prevented, and would even unfold in the most ironic of ways. One boy was doomed to die in a train accident - but it was a short circuit in his train set that killed him. A girl was meant to die in a fire. Instead, she passed out and died of a heart defect at a nightclub called 'Inferno'. Another was meant to be struck by lightning, but he died instead when some idiot threw a bottle of Blue Lightning at him, causing him to crash his motorbike.

Most of us died the way we were told, of course. We often meet up weeks or days before to support the next to die. We'd even watch *Final Destination*, have a party, get drunk. But each final toast had the air of a death rattle about it. We never attended the funeral, of course. That was a step too far.

Most of us are gone now. My own death is coming in a few weeks. I know how it will unfold; I will be found dead in my armchair, my laptop still on. It will be my wife who finds me; she's seven months pregnant. Our son will grow up loving a father he never met. The puppet told me so. He's been in my dreams lately, telling me it will be OK. I want to believe him, and I think he wants to believe it too.

I don't know what happens next. Maybe immortality is being remembered and loved. I don't know.

But I do know what will happen in this life. We've known all along. I'm just glad not to see it. The last few deaths will be terrifying. They showed the world being riven with destruction, parts of it unmade and remade, reality stretched and torn, of distorted dark things stalking the land, blizzards of frozen blood, ancient things rising from the wastes. The ones we love will survive, but few others will. We won't.

,nosleep,"Last night, I was looking through my emails from my cringy phases from when I was 12. You know, those... phases where you think you’re cool because you’re different from the other girls.

While scrolling through, I found an interesting email I sent my middle school teacher for my homework. I don’t remember any of this, by the way. I do remember being confused during the interview, that’s one thing. 

The video in the email was an interview with my older sister, Lou. She’s probably 18 in the video.
I was supposed to do a mock interview - you know that shitty homework where you had to ask your family members questions? I had to ask about their jobs.
I didn’t ask my parents because they were usually pretty fucking busy. My sister, however...
She’s had plenty of jobs. She just happened to be free and out of a job from an accident in her recent job.

The reason why I’m posting this here is that... shit, it’s creepy and weird, isn’t it? You people are good with shit like this. I’ll try my best to explain at one point, I promise.
... I still don’t fully know what happened. I’m not even sure if Lou’s fine talking about this.

I’d like your opinion on this, nosleep.



In the video, is myself and my sister. We’re both sitting on a plastic chair - I’m clutching my papers, while my sister smiles at the camera.

LOU: Is it rolling? Do you want me to check?

INTERVIEWER: Oh! It’s ok, I’ll do—

LOU: It’s alright, I can walk. Besides, you don’t know how to use the camera, dumbass.

Lou stands up. She’s wearing red shorts, you can see that she has a prosthetic left leg. She limps for a bit, walking over to the camera. She turns around, giving me a thumbs up.

She goes back to her seat, rubbing her leg.
Lou nods at me, who is nervously looking at my papers.

INTERVIEWER: H... Hello.

Um...

Let me try that again...

Hello!

My name is Carrie and I’m 12 years old. I’m doing this inter— interview for Mr Daffodil. This is my homework.

In this video, I’ll be interviewing my big sister about her job—

LOU: My old job. I don’t have a job now.

INTERVIEWER: You ruined my introduction!

LOU: Haha, sorry. Go on.

INTERVIEWER: Um... Mr Daffodil, if you’re watching, I’m skipping the introduction. Sorry.

LOU: I thought that was the important part?

INTERVIEWER: Umm... It’s fine, he’ll understand. It doesn’t matter. You don’t get an introduction, Lou.

Um... Let me look... I have questions for you...

LOU: About my jobs? 

INTERVIEWER: Um...

INTERVIEWER: ... Okay! Lou, have you had any jobs? Any interesting ones?

LOU: Ooh, let me think.

She tucks her blonde hair behind her ears.

Hmm...
Give me a second. All the jobs I’ve had was painfully boring.

Ooh, maybe, maybe... I had a nice job at the cinema. You know, the one around the corner—

INTERVIEWER: Aww... Can’t you think of any interesting ones?

LOU: What do you mean? Let’s get this over with.

INTERVIEWER: Um... Like that... one scary job you had at the hotel.

...

......

Lou suddenly looks uncomfortable.

INTERVIEWER: ...Lou?

LOU: You know mammy doesn’t like it when I talk about it to you. Says it’ll give you nightmares. 

I still get nightmares from this, you know.

INTERVIEWER: Aww, come on...

LOU: ...
Fine...

... I could tell you a little bit about it...

Just a little bit, okay?

I let out a loud cheer, as I throw away my papers.
Lou shifts in her chair uncomfortably, looking at her prosthetic leg.
She looks at the camera, then back at me.

... Okay.

Don’t be angry at me if you shit yourself.

INTERVIEWER: Hey! Language! This is for school!

LOU: ...
Sorry.
I worked as a bellgirl. Briefly.
Uh... The hotel was all over the news before, y’ see...
You might recognise the name... Hotel Lanrom was it...? I think that was the one.

...

What did you want to ask me, again?

INTERVIEWER: Oh! Just about your job, just talk about it! How did you find it? All that stuff. For the video.

LOU: Yes... Erm...
I originally found the job through the— uh, billboard in the fish n’ chips shop. Remember the shop next to the newspaper shop with a grumpy lady, Carrie?
 That shop... The billboard next to the fish tank, they usually put up adverts... Missing posters, stuff like that.

I’d originally found the job advert for it. I just ignored it, but I found it again later on a website.

I... Yes, Carrie. Don’t give me that face.

So I applied for the job. They accepted me almost instantly.

INTERVIEWER: How?

LOU: Oh. Good grades. Plus plenty of work experience before that.

...

I should get on with the job, right? You’re supposed to be asking me questions. What was on the piece of paper?

INTERVIEWER: ...

I quickly pick up my papers.

Yeah! What did you have to do?

LOU: The job? Oh, I had to greet guests and carry their luggage. Bags. Stuff.

Sometimes, I’d bring food to their rooms. Or if it was quiet, I’d clean the rooms.

... I had a list of instructions. Rules. I had to follow them, or I’d be in danger.

INTERVIEWER: ... Ah?
Instructions? What do you mean by that? I didn’t know this!
They sound so strict...

LOU: Oh... Strict, yes. The owners were very strict. It was a small hotel... but it was very dangerous.

INTERVIEWER: How come?

LOU: ...

Suddenly, the alarm for the time limit of the interview goes off. I ignore it, pushing it away.

She pauses, scrunching up her face.

They were very specific with what I could do, what I couldn’t do, and so on. I remember one rule...
The rule told me not to talk to the window cleaner. What was his name...

She closes her eyes. I open my mouth to say something, probably to ask for the name, but I quickly shut up.

... I don’t want to remember his name.
You don’t mind... if I don’t say his name, right?

She gulps, clasping her hands together. I look nervous now, glancing at the camera every couple seconds.
Finally, she’s just barely able to speak again, her voice thick with fear.

... Ah... He was so scary.

He wouldn’t leave me alone.
The other bellboy had to keep her eyes peeled open for him.

INTERVIEWER: Huh...? Who?

LOU: No, it’s fine. Just someone I met because I broke the rules.

INTERVIEWER: Do you still have the instructions?

LOU: Yeah. Somewhere in my room. I read through them sometimes.

INTERVIEWER: Can I see it?!

LOU: No. You’ll get nightmares. I’m sorry.

INTERVIEWER: Aww, please, pretty please!

LOU: No. I said no. Maybe I’ll show it to you some other time, but no. I don’t want mammy to rip off my head.

...

Don’t you think you’ve had enough?

INTERVIEWER: Ah! The time limit, it went off ages ago! Thank you for— uh— um...

Thank you for agreeing to do this with me!

LOU: ...
Of course...

I chuckle, waving at the camera with the biggest smile, as Lou limps over, switching off the camera. The last thing I see is her grim, terrified face, before it ends abruptly. 



Looking back on this, it doesn’t seem right, does it,,?
Especially the part about the window cleaner, at least.
God, I was such a stupid girl. Why didn’t I notice I was upsetting her?
Lou’s moved out, though, she lives with her girlfriend now. Most of her old stuff is still here, but her room is locked shut. I’m starting to wonder if I can find the rules she mentioned... But I have a feeling it’s a bad idea.
... If she got scared from the mention of her job there, then she must’ve seen some serious shit there, right...?

But still, it’s weird, when I try to search for Hotel Lanrom, I can’t really find any results for it. We live in the U.K.

You know, those... phases where you think you’re cool because you’re different from the other girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While scrolling through, I found an interesting email I sent my middle school teacher for my homework. I don’t remember any of this, by the way. I do remember being confused during the interview, that’s one thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video in the email was an interview with my older sister, Lou. She’s probably 18 in the video.
I was supposed to do a mock interview - you know that shitty homework where you had to ask your family members questions? I had to ask about their jobs.
I didn’t ask my parents because they were usually pretty fucking busy. My sister, however...
She’s had plenty of jobs. She just happened to be free and out of a job from an accident in her recent job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I’m posting this here is that... shit, it’s creepy and weird, isn’t it? You people are good with shit like this. I’ll try my best to explain at one point, I promise.
... I still don’t fully know what happened. I’m not even sure if Lou’s fine talking about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like your opinion on this, nosleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video, is myself and my sister. We’re both sitting on a plastic chair - I’m clutching my papers, while my sister smiles at the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOU: Is it rolling? Do you want me to check?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERVIEWER: Oh! It’s ok, I’ll do—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOU: It’s alright, I can walk. Besides, you don’t know how to use the camera, dumbass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lou stands up. She’s wearing red shorts, you can see that she has a prosthetic left leg. She limps for a bit, walking over to the camera. She turns around, giving me a thumbs up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She goes back to her seat, rubbing her leg.
Lou nods at me, who is nervously looking at my papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERVIEWER: H... Hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me try that again...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Carrie and I’m 12 years old. I’m doing this inter— interview for Mr Daffodil. This is my homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, I’ll be interviewing my big sister about her job—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOU: My old job. I don’t have a job now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERVIEWER: You ruined my introduction!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOU: Haha, sorry. Go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERVIEWER: Um... Mr Daffodil, if you’re watching, I’m skipping the introduction. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"""Come find me daddy!"" Lilly blurted from upstairs. I suppose it was time for our daily game of hide and seek.


""Why do I have to always be the seeker?"" I joked while pulling myself up off the couch. I heard her muffled giggles as I began to climb the stairs. Rounding the corner, I entered the bathroom. Slowly, I crept up to the shower curtain. ""Gotta be more clever than that!"" I ripped the curtain to the side. Another poorly concealed giggle cascaded down the hallway. ""Okay. You're getting better at this."" I smiled as I approached her bedroom doorway. I saw a lumpy mass under the blanket. I tip-toed over to the edge of the bed. ""...but I know all the tricks."" I swiftly tore away the cover to reveal the pillows underneath. ""Pillows! That's a pretty advanced move."" I remarked patronizingly.


""Gotcha!"" Echoed from the hall as my eyes snapped back to the doorway.


""You know, talking isn't gonna make it any easier on you."" I playfully scolded. I meandered my way down to the doorway to my bedroom. ""Well looks like there's only one room left. Your time is running out, little red."" I quietly made my way to the middle of the room. ""Found ya!"" I shouted as I dropped to my hands and knees to look under the bed. Nothing. I noticed a faint dripping sound coming from the closet. That's where I figured she was but that was kind of odd. Puzzled, I got back to my feet and slowly paced over to the shuddered doors. ""I guess there's only one place left to hide, little lady."" I creak the door open to reveal a freckled face with cold green eyes peering back at me.


""You found me."" She said with a blank stare. Slowly emerging from the dark closet, she approached and wrapped her arms around my waist. 


""Yeah! You're getting good at this game huh?"" I rebutaled with a fake smile. Something felt off. Shivers slowly forced their way up my spine. I started feeling the onset of a terrible headache.


""Lots and lots and lots of practice."" She asserted while looking up at me with those emerald beacons of hatred.


""Alright sweetie, why don't you go outside and play with Cheech until mommy gets home from work."" I guided her with my hand on her shoulder and gave her a little push to point her in the right direction. I followed her downstairs and watched as she left through the sliding door to the backyard.


I settled in on the couch doing my best not to irritate my already throbbing head. I don't know what to think at this point. I've never seen my own daughter look so menacing. Was that my daughter? I'm clearly being irrational because of this splitting pain in my head. Still I can't get those malice-tinged stares out of my mind. 


The obsessive thoughts turned into nightmares as I succumbed to an overpowering drowsiness. I'm awoken by the mechanical clicking of the lock and door handle. 


""Good morning."" Jessie smiled. ""Having a little nap before dinner are we? Must be nice."" She teased while leaning down for a kiss.


""Not on purpose. I had a horrific migraine and it just kinda happened.""


""I'm sorry babe. Did you take your medicine?"" She gently ran her fingers through my hair.


""No, I ran out a couple days ago. I need to go see my doctor again, but I've just not had the motivation to do it.""


""Well it sounds like you should have plenty of motivation now."" She spoke in a loving jest. ""I'm gonna get dinner started. Where's Lilly?"" She inquired while moseying into the kitchen.

Suddenly I remembered the frightening events from earlier. Certainly it was just my mind playing tricks on me because of the head trauma.


""She was outback with Cheech before I passed out."" 


""I see her, she's just sitting on the porch. Am I going to have to get a babysitter while you're not feeling well?"" She said with concern.


""No, no. It wasn't that big of a deal. I've only been asleep for 20 minutes tops."" I said, feeling a bit guilty. ""I'm not very hungry though. Would you hate me if I went upstairs and got some rest?"" I pleaded trying to be coy.


""I could never hate you more than I already do."" She smiled a big, toothy grin and we both laughed. We shared a strange sense of humor. I gave her a farewell kiss and retreated to bed.


Hours later I awoke to a dimly lit room by the stirring of the blankets next to me. I rolled over and wrapped my arms around Jessie. She was cold. She's always cold. ""Hey honey, did you notice anything weird about Lilly today."" I prodded.


She turns her head to face mine. ""No, she seemed fine to me. Why?"" I could smell the red wine on her breath. A replacement for the affection of a loving husband, no doubt. 


""I don't know. She just seemed… kinda off. Almost hateful. I can't really explain it.""


""What did she say to you?"" A hint of worry escaped her eyes.


""She didn't say anything out of the ordinary I guess. Just the way she looked at me. Like she was releasing a lifetime of anger toward me.""


Her eyes shifted back and forth between mine. ""Babe you know how you get when you don't have your medicine. I'm sure you were just misreading the situation. You know she's a daddy's girl.""


""Yeah I know you're right. It just felt so real. I'll drop it."" We laid in silence until we both drifted off. I swear as I teetered on the edge of sleep I could hear a distant drip.


My eyes opened up to a sun-drenched ceiling. The throbbing in my forehead was still there but not quite as intolerable. I hear the familiar pittering of a child and her dog playing in the hallway.


""Lilly, you know Cheech is not supposed to be in the house!"" I squawked. The commotion stopped and I could hear them approaching. She stood in the doorway.


""It was raining this morning and he doesn't like the wet."" Those green eyes still burning with contempt.


""I don't care. You know your mom is allergic. Put him back outside. Now."" I didn't think any more anger could be piled into those eyes, but I was wrong.


It was 9:30 already. Jessie had already left for work. I sat up and felt the weight of my head shift the pain throughout my brain. My vision was shaky and out of focus. I made my way downstairs. ""Have you eaten yet?"" I felt obligated to ask.


""Mom left me some Poptarts."" She recounted with an emotionless face.


""Alright sweetie, why don't you go up to your room and play?"" It was an order in the form of a question. She understood that. I couldn't bear being around her ever since the stares from yesterday.


After a few episodes of a random Netflix show I didn't pay much attention to, I got the invitation. ""Come find me daddy!""


""Not in the mood today Lilly."" I returned.


""Aw come on. It's our game, daddy."" She sounded disappointed, but I knew she still had that displeased look on her face.


""Fine. Just one round."" I trudged my way up the stairs. Near the top I was hit with a metallic smell mixed with rotted food that lingered in the air. I lifted my shirt over my nose. ""What did you do up here? It stinks like hell."" I walked into the bathroom and jerked the curtain out of the way. Just the dingy bathtub. I hurried into Lilly's bedroom and saw a similar mass under the blankets as the day before. I patted it and felt the softness of what I assume was more pillows. I sped down to my bedroom and threw open the closet. There she was.


""You found me, daddy. I bet you didn't expect me to be in the same place twice."" An innocent comment drowned by her scornful gaze.


""What did you do?! What is that smell filling up the whole house?"" 


""Daddy, I don't smell nothing."" Of course. Why would the brat admit to doing something wrong?


""Whatever. Just get out of my room and go watch TV or something."" Another resentful look to add to the collection. I spent the remainder of the day curled up in a ball on the couch, making sure Lilly didn't fuck anything else up in the house. The headaches were getting more severe and closer together. Jessie would be home around 5:30. It was 4:50. I figured I could slip in a little nap. 


Jessie arrived and hung her dripping wet coat on the rack after she shut the door. ""Hey, you still look like shit. Not feeling any better?"" She put it bluntly.


""Not at all, and Lilly has been an absolute pain today. The same rude, harsh looks and I don't know what she did upstairs but it smells like something died up there.""


She froze. I could tell she was alarmed by that. Her green eyes started to take a familiar characteristic. ""Where is she?""


""I just took another short nap. She probably wandered upstairs."" She shot me a look of shame and began her climb up the stairs. She wouldn't return for a while. I decided on another little bit of rest.


I was roused by a stern hand on my shoulder. My vision took a few seconds to focus. It was Jessie. She looked serious. Typically she had a lighthearted aura about her. This wasn't her normal demeanor. ""We have to talk about what's going on."" She stated very matter-of-factly. ""Your daughter said you've been mean to her all day and you're blaming her for some imaginary smell. You haven't even fed her today. What the hell is going on?"" She stared intensely at me. I could feel the judgment piercing through me.


""I don't know…"" I muttered with tears welling up in my eyes. ""I feel like I'm going crazy."" Jessie feigned comforting gestures but I could tell it was all an act. She was disgusted with me.


""Your daughter has been up in her room crying because she thinks her father is mad at her. You have to go to the doctor tomorrow and fix this."" She barked her orders at me like I was a child.


""I will.""


""Good. Go up to the bedroom and get some sleep and I'll take you in the morning."" 


""I can't, there's no way I could sleep through that awful smell up there.""


She rolled her eyes. What a bitch. Like I wanted any of this to happen. She gave me a final look of pity and disdain before returning upstairs. I rolled over and managed to get back to sleep even through the pulsating pain radiating throughout my entire head.


""Daddy, come find me!"" I heard in the distance. It was dark. Around 3 in the morning. The smell had spread to the downstairs and my god it was even worse than before. Like being face to face with roadkill. I dedicated my left hand to keeping my nose clenched shut. I hear the dripping sounds still. Some coming from the coat rack. Some traveled from upstairs.

""Daddy? Are you coming?""


I stood up hesitantly. ""I'm coming sweetie."" I made my way over to the stairs and immediately noticed the bloody mess all down the stairs. What the fuck was going on here. I paused for a good minute before making the commitment of climbing the sinister flight. At the top I turned to see the hallway in the same condition as the steps. A tormented corridor of red. I make the next left to the bathroom. I stay still and quiet for a moment of trepidation before advancing to the tub. My trembling hand outstretched reaching for the curtain.


I rip it open.


The tub is filled to the brim with gore. Blood, sinew, bone, organs, muscle, hair. All mixed together into a broth from hell. Startled, I slipped and fell onto the bloodsoaked floor. I crawled out into the hall and pulled the door shut with a loud thud. A giggle echoed from down the hall. I regained what little composure I had to gather and stood up. I slowly paced my way to Lilly's room. Unsurprisingly it was in absolute, morbid disarray just like the bathroom. Bloody toys strewn about. Patches of red hair decorating the floor in bloody clumps. Then there was the familiar mass underneath the red-covered blanket. Taking a few deep breaths I reached out nervously.


I tore the blanket off.


It was Cheech. The big German Shepherd was flayed open from end to end. All insides pulled out and haphazardly decorated the mattress. We got him as a puppy when Lilly was born. 


""Gotcha again daddy!"" Lilly's voice thundered from down the hall. I wasn't ready to face the horrors of whatever lay in my bedroom but it had to be done. I marched forward. The room engulfed in blood and pain. Ready to end this nightmare, I stood eclipsing the closet door. I reach my bloody hand out and firmly grip the handle, dreading the impending sight of those menacing green eyes.


I slowly inch the door open.


No eyes. Thank God no eyes. My daughter's face stared back at me. Draped from a hanger in the closet. No eyes. Just the perfectly peeled face of my daughter, without the evil contamination of those damn eyes. Single droplets of blood dripped from the inside of the daughter-mask. I placed my hand against it. So soft. So beautiful. I removed it from it's home and slowly raised my daughter's face up to mine. I felt the sticky wetness bonding our faces together like a spiritual adhesive. I inhaled a deep breath.

I suppose it was time for our daily game of hide and seek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why do I have to always be the seeker?&amp;quot; I joked while pulling myself up off the couch. I heard her muffled giggles as I began to climb the stairs. Rounding the corner, I entered the bathroom. Slowly, I crept up to the shower curtain. &amp;quot;Gotta be more clever than that!&amp;quot; I ripped the curtain to the side. Another poorly concealed giggle cascaded down the hallway. &amp;quot;Okay. You&amp;#39;re getting better at this.&amp;quot; I smiled as I approached her bedroom doorway. I saw a lumpy mass under the blanket. I tip-toed over to the edge of the bed. &amp;quot;...but I know all the tricks.&amp;quot; I swiftly tore away the cover to reveal the pillows underneath. &amp;quot;Pillows! That&amp;#39;s a pretty advanced move.&amp;quot; I remarked patronizingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gotcha!&amp;quot; Echoed from the hall as my eyes snapped back to the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know, talking isn&amp;#39;t gonna make it any easier on you.&amp;quot; I playfully scolded. I meandered my way down to the doorway to my bedroom. &amp;quot;Well looks like there&amp;#39;s only one room left. Your time is running out, little red.&amp;quot; I quietly made my way to the middle of the room. &amp;quot;Found ya!&amp;quot; I shouted as I dropped to my hands and knees to look under the bed. Nothing. I noticed a faint dripping sound coming from the closet. That&amp;#39;s where I figured she was but that was kind of odd. Puzzled, I got back to my feet and slowly paced over to the shuddered doors. &amp;quot;I guess there&amp;#39;s only one place left to hide, little lady.&amp;quot; I creak the door open to reveal a freckled face with cold green eyes peering back at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You found me.&amp;quot; She said with a blank stare. Slowly emerging from the dark closet, she approached and wrapped her arms around my waist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah! You&amp;#39;re getting good at this game huh?&amp;quot; I rebutaled with a fake smile. Something felt off. Shivers slowly forced their way up my spine. I started feeling the onset of a terrible headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lots and lots and lots of practice.&amp;quot; She asserted while looking up at me with those emerald beacons of hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright sweetie, why don&amp;#39;t you go outside and play with Cheech until mommy gets home from work.&amp;quot; I guided her with my hand on her shoulder and gave her a little push to point her in the right direction. I followed her downstairs and watched as she left through the sliding door to the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled in on the couch doing my best not to irritate my already throbbing head. I don&amp;#39;t know what to think at this point. I&amp;#39;ve never seen my own daughter look so menacing. Was that my daughter? I&amp;#39;m clearly being irrational because of this splitting pain in my head. Still I can&amp;#39;t get those malice-tinged stares out of my mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obsessive thoughts turned into nightmares as I succumbed to an overpowering drowsiness. I&amp;#39;m awoken by the mechanical clicking of the lock and door handle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning.&amp;quot; Jessie smiled. &amp;quot;Having a little nap before dinner are we? Must be nice.&amp;quot; She teased while leaning down for a kiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not on purpose. I had a horrific migraine and it just kinda happened.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry babe. Did you take your medicine?&amp;quot; She gently ran her fingers through my hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, I ran out a couple days ago. I need to go see my doctor again, but I&amp;#39;ve just not had the motivation to do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well it sounds like you should have plenty of motivation now.&amp;quot; She spoke in a loving jest. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna get dinner started. Where&amp;#39;s Lilly?&amp;quot; She inquired while moseying into the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I remembered the frightening events from earlier. Certainly it was just my mind playing tricks on me because of the head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was outback with Cheech before I passed out.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I see her, she&amp;#39;s just sitting on the porch. Am I going to have to get a babysitter while you&amp;#39;re not feeling well?&amp;quot; She said with concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, no. It wasn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal. I&amp;#39;ve only been asleep for 20 minutes tops.&amp;quot; I said, feeling a bit guilty. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not very hungry though. Would you hate me if I went upstairs and got some rest?&amp;quot; I pleaded trying to be coy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I could never hate you more than I already do.&amp;quot; She smiled a big, toothy grin and we both laughed. We shared a strange sense of humor. I gave her a farewell kiss and retreated to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours later I awoke to a dimly lit room by the stirring of the blankets next to me. I rolled over and wrapped my arms around Jessie. She was cold. She&amp;#39;s always cold. &amp;quot;Hey honey, did you notice anything weird about Lilly today.&amp;quot; I prodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She turns her head to face mine. &amp;quot;No, she seemed fine to me. Why?&amp;quot; I could smell the red wine on her breath. A replacement for the affection of a loving husband, no doubt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. She just seemed… kinda off. Almost hateful. I can&amp;#39;t really explain it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did she say to you?&amp;quot; A hint of worry escaped her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She didn&amp;#39;t say anything out of the ordinary I guess. Just the way she looked at me. Like she was releasing a lifetime of anger toward me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her eyes shifted back and forth between mine. &amp;quot;Babe you know how you get when you don&amp;#39;t have your medicine. I&amp;#39;m sure you were just misreading the situation. You know she&amp;#39;s a daddy&amp;#39;s girl.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah I know you&amp;#39;re right. It just felt so real. I&amp;#39;ll drop it.&amp;quot; We laid in silence until we both drifted off. I swear as I teetered on the edge of sleep I could hear a distant drip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes opened up to a sun-drenched ceiling. The throbbing in my forehead was still there but not quite as intolerable. I hear the familiar pittering of a child and her dog playing in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lilly, you know Cheech is not supposed to be in the house!&amp;quot; I squawked. The commotion stopped and I could hear them approaching. She stood in the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It was raining this morning and he doesn&amp;#39;t like the wet.&amp;quot; Those green eyes still burning with contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care. You know your mom is allergic. Put him back outside. Now.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t think any more anger could be piled into those eyes, but I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 9:30 already. Jessie had already left for work. I sat up and felt the weight of my head shift the pain throughout my brain. My vision was shaky and out of focus. I made my way downstairs. &amp;quot;Have you eaten yet?&amp;quot; I felt obligated to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mom left me some Poptarts.&amp;quot; She recounted with an emotionless face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright sweetie, why don&amp;#39;t you go up to your room and play?&amp;quot; It was an order in the form of a question. She understood that. I couldn&amp;#39;t bear being around her ever since the stares from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few episodes of a random Netflix show I didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to, I got the invitation. &amp;quot;Come find me daddy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not in the mood today Lilly.&amp;quot; I returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aw come on. It&amp;#39;s our game, daddy.&amp;quot; She sounded disappointed, but I knew she still had that displeased look on her face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine. Just one round.&amp;quot; I trudged my way up the stairs. Near the top I was hit with a metallic smell mixed with rotted food that lingered in the air. I lifted my shirt over my nose. &amp;quot;What did you do up here? It stinks like hell.&amp;quot; I walked into the bathroom and jerked the curtain out of the way. Just the dingy bathtub. I hurried into Lilly&amp;#39;s bedroom and saw a similar mass under the blankets as the day before. I patted it and felt the softness of what I assume was more pillows. I sped down to my bedroom and threw open the closet. There she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You found me, daddy. I bet you didn&amp;#39;t expect me to be in the same place twice.&amp;quot; An innocent comment drowned by her scornful gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did you do?! What is that smell filling up the whole house?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy, I don&amp;#39;t smell nothing.&amp;quot; Of course. Why would the brat admit to doing something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whatever. Just get out of my room and go watch TV or something.&amp;quot; Another resentful look to add to the collection. I spent the remainder of the day curled up in a ball on the couch, making sure Lilly didn&amp;#39;t fuck anything else up in the house. The headaches were getting more severe and closer together. Jessie would be home around 5:30. It was 4:50. I figured I could slip in a little nap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie arrived and hung her dripping wet coat on the rack after she shut the door. &amp;quot;Hey, you still look like shit. Not feeling any better?&amp;quot; She put it bluntly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not at all, and Lilly has been an absolute pain today. The same rude, harsh looks and I don&amp;#39;t know what she did upstairs but it smells like something died up there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She froze. I could tell she was alarmed by that. Her green eyes started to take a familiar characteristic. &amp;quot;Where is she?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just took another short nap. She probably wandered upstairs.&amp;quot; She shot me a look of shame and began her climb up the stairs. She wouldn&amp;#39;t return for a while. I decided on another little bit of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was roused by a stern hand on my shoulder. My vision took a few seconds to focus. It was Jessie. She looked serious. Typically she had a lighthearted aura about her. This wasn&amp;#39;t her normal demeanor. &amp;quot;We have to talk about what&amp;#39;s going on.&amp;quot; She stated very matter-of-factly. &amp;quot;Your daughter said you&amp;#39;ve been mean to her all day and you&amp;#39;re blaming her for some imaginary smell. You haven&amp;#39;t even fed her today. What the hell is going on?&amp;quot; She stared intensely at me. I could feel the judgment piercing through me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know…&amp;quot; I muttered with tears welling up in my eyes. &amp;quot;I feel like I&amp;#39;m going crazy.&amp;quot; Jessie feigned comforting gestures but I could tell it was all an act. She was disgusted with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your daughter has been up in her room crying because she thinks her father is mad at her. You have to go to the doctor tomorrow and fix this.&amp;quot; She barked her orders at me like I was a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good. Go up to the bedroom and get some sleep and I&amp;#39;ll take you in the morning.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t, there&amp;#39;s no way I could sleep through that awful smell up there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She rolled her eyes. What a bitch. Like I wanted any of this to happen. She gave me a final look of pity and disdain before returning upstairs. I rolled over and managed to get back to sleep even through the pulsating pain radiating throughout my entire head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy, come find me!&amp;quot; I heard in the distance. It was dark. Around 3 in the morning. The smell had spread to the downstairs and my god it was even worse than before. Like being face to face with roadkill. I dedicated my left hand to keeping my nose clenched shut. I hear the dripping sounds still. Some coming from the coat rack. Some traveled from upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy? Are you coming?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood up hesitantly. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m coming sweetie.&amp;quot; I made my way over to the stairs and immediately noticed the bloody mess all down the stairs. What the fuck was going on here. I paused for a good minute before making the commitment of climbing the sinister flight. At the top I turned to see the hallway in the same condition as the steps. A tormented corridor of red. I make the next left to the bathroom. I stay still and quiet for a moment of trepidation before advancing to the tub. My trembling hand outstretched reaching for the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rip it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tub is filled to the brim with gore. Blood, sinew, bone, organs, muscle, hair. All mixed together into a broth from hell. Startled, I slipped and fell onto the bloodsoaked floor. I crawled out into the hall and pulled the door shut with a loud thud. A giggle echoed from down the hall. I regained what little composure I had to gather and stood up. I slowly paced my way to Lilly&amp;#39;s room. Unsurprisingly it was in absolute, morbid disarray just like the bathroom. Bloody toys strewn about.

Then I saw the ad.

The link took me to a website that looked like it was designed in 1995. Text scrolled across the top of the page.

“Fuckin’ scammers,” I said, moving the mouse to the top of the page to exit. 


Before I could click the red “X,” a text box appeared.


“This is not a scam!” 


My only option was to click OK, so I did. I was taken to a page featuring a large photo of a pill bottle with a plain white label. The words “Creative Juices” were scribbled in black permanent marker.


“Yeah, okay,” I thought, and again tried to exit the site. 


Another pop-up appeared.

This time, I attempted to quit the browser entirely. It wouldn’t. I restarted my computer. The window was there upon launch. Now the pop-up was more insistent.


“Try it.”


I clicked OK.


I was taken to a form asking for my name and address. No credit card or bank account info. I entered a fake name, the P.O. Box I used for Amazon, and clicked Submit.


“Thank you! Please check your mailbox tomorrow!” 


Now it felt as though someone was watching me. Without really thinking about it, I slid my webcam cover to the closed position but still, I felt eyes piercing into the back of my skull. 


I turned around, examining my surroundings and assuring myself that I was, in fact, alone. When I turned back to my computer, the screen had changed. 


A face, if you could call it that, had overtaken my screen. It was more shocking than scary, but it chilled me to the bone all the same. The darkened face seemed to be out of focus, and had no features to note. It did nothing but stare.


I knew it was staring at me. 


“What the fuck!?” I shouted, slamming the lid to my laptop down. My heart raced in my chest, my limbs shook uncontrollably and a lump formed in my throat. 


I decided that I’d had enough for the night. Rest would be my only option and, hopefully, would clear my head. 


The next morning I woke up with an anxious feeling in my chest. If that website was correct, I would have some creative juices waiting for me in my P.O. Box, but could I trust it?


Against my better judgement, I grabbed a quick breakfast and made my way out the door, straight for the post office.


Upon arrival, I noticed that feeling come back. As if I were being stalked by a secret onlooker. I whipped around, examining my surroundings only to find I was alone. 


I approached my box, key in hand and shakily jammed it into the lock. I opened it, and to my surprise, there it was.


It wasn’t packaged, which struck me as a bit odd. It was just a plain white pill bottle standing upright in the small slot. The label faced outward and was identical to the one in the picture on the website. 


Just a simple, white sticker with the words “Creative Juices” scribbled on it in permanent marker. 


I snatched the bottle out and slipped it into the pocket of my coat. As I made my way home I felt a mixture of excitement and dread pounding in my chest. 


What would I do with them? Should I take them or just wait? Maybe do a little research before I just throw them down my throat.


When I got back to my house, I took the pills out of my pocket and set the down on my kitchen counter, staring, terrified and intrigued. 


There wasn’t much to go by, but I did notice, on the backside, that there was small print. Just a simple phrase, short and sweet. 


Take only 1 pill.


The vagueness of the phrase was baffling. Did they mean only one at a time, one in a twelve hour window, one total? Why would they sell a bottle full of the pills if I was only supposed to take one?


I sat down, opening my laptop and booting it up. I googled “creative juices pills,” but couldn’t find much. 


There was one thread that mentioned them. It only had four entries, three of which were by the original poster.

Thundercats66: Hey guys, I found these pills online. Has anyone ever heard of them? They’re called “Creative juices” I didn’t pay anything for them. I thought it was a hoax considering how shitty the website looked, but then I got a pop-up saying they’d just send em to me. They were in my mailbox the next day. The only writing on them, aside from the words “Creative Juices” is some small type on the back that says “Take only 1 pill”… kinda creepy if you ask me, but now I’m just looking at them. I think I might try them.

CJBoston123: Seems a little off. Have you tried the pills yet? What did they do? I think I found the website. It looks real shitty. Not sure I’d trust it.


7/14/2015

Thundercats66: Yep, I took em. Let me tell you, I thought it was going to be bullshit. I was sure they wouldn’t work. When I took them, I got really drowsy. I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I tried to fight it, but there was no fighting it. It was as if I’d just taken some sort of ambien or something. When I woke up, I was in front of my computer and my demo tape was done! Holy shit, I still can’t figure out how it happened but there it was, and the tracks hit HARD! I did what the instructions said and only took 1. Maybe I’ll try 2 tonight and see what happens. Doesn’t seem too harmful.

Thundercats66: DO NOT TAKE THESE PILLS! I CAN’T STRESS IT ENOUGH. I'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR ALMOST A WEEK NOW. EVERYTIME I STOP, HE’S RIGHT THERE. DO. NOT. TAKE. THE. PILLS. IT’S A TRAP!


----


I felt my heart drop and blood run cold. I sat there for a moment, reading the thread over and over again in horror, terrified at what awaited me if I took those pills. Who was he talking about? What did he mean by “it’s a trap?” 


It’s gotta be a hoax, I thought, trying to come to my senses. 


What would I do? Just throw them away? No harm no foul if I did. I didn’t pay anything for them so if I just tossed them in the garbage, I wouldn’t be losing anything. 


The intrigue was gripping me, though. I couldn’t help but wonder what if... 


What if I did take only one? What if I took more? What could possibly happen that would be so traumatizing and horrific?


I decided to stash the bottle away, rather than throw it the trash. I couldn’t just throw away such a great opportunity, no matter how horrifying the prospect seemed. 


The next day I awoke to an email from my publisher telling me he needed my chapters by the end of the day. I scrambled, putting together whatever I could in an attempt to save my job. When I read back what I had written, I was disgusted. I couldn’t come up with a plot, there was nothing compelling or original about the story. I had no chance of saving my job. 


I thought about it hard. I weighed the risk versus reward. Those magic pills that were stashed in my cabinet and they seemed to call to me. 


Against my better judgement, I caved. I grabbed the pills out of the cabinet and popped the top off. The smell that hit was thick and coated my nostrils making my eyes water. It was a scent of vinegar laced with harsh chemicals. A smell that was anything but appetizing. 


I dropped one of them out, into the palm of my hand and examined it. There was nothing special, just a small white circle. No markings or scores like you’d find on a normal pill. 


I took a deep breath, readying a drink in my other hand, and popped it into my mouth. It fizzed inside of my mouth for a moment. A peculiar feeling, indeed, but it was slightly pleasant. It tingled and seemed to dissolve before I could take a swig of my drink. 


I sat down in front of my laptop and waited. Nearly ten minutes passed before I began to feel the effects. Much quicker than I’d expected. 


Just as the forum user had stated, I became drowsy. Increasingly tired with each passing second until I couldn’t hold my eyes open. I slowly drifted off into the darkness of unconsciousness.


When I awoke, I was seated upright, facing my computer screen. I glanced down at the clock and noticed six hours had passed. I’d lost SIX DAMN HOURS. 


However, I quickly found myself ecstatic when I noticed that on the brightly lit screen was an open word document. It was a completed manuscript. It had been formatted and everything! I couldn’t believe my eyes. I checked the word count only to find that there were a total of 68,947 words. 


“No way!” I yelled in a combination of joy and disbelief. I’d done it. I’d completed my manuscript and it was all thanks to those mysterious, terrifying pills. 


I began reading the story through, the entire time the feeling of being watched persisted. I gulped down a wad of saliva and continued reading, fighting the urge to look over my shoulder. 


To my surprise, the story was perfect! An excellent combination of chilling horror, the perfect crime and intriguing mystery. It was exactly what I needed for the project. Thrilled at the conclusion, I immediately emailed it to my publisher, afraid if I’d waited any longer I’d miss my deadline. 


I waited impatiently at my computer, praying to hear back from my publisher as soon as possible. I’d noticed, in my time spent waiting, that strange sounds creaked through my house. Unexplained scratching sounds in the walls, eerie faucets dripping when there was no faucet running. Goose flesh rose on my skin and chills ran down my spine. 


Soon my publisher got back to me. He said he was thrilled with the work I’d sent him. So thrilled, in fact, that he immediately commissioned me to write another novel. He said he’d prefer if it were a sequel, but would accept another original work if it was up to the same standard. 


I excitedly accepted his offer and sat down at my computer. I was ready to plot out another future bestseller.


Writer’s block… 


Fuck, fuck, fuck… I thought, trying to think of anything that might make a decent story. Any arc or character who would be intriguing enough to follow through three hundred pages. There was nothing but dead air playing through my head, though. 


I couldn’t have this. I needed this opportunity. I needed the money! Then, I remembered the pills. The instructions said the only take one, yes. The user on that forum stressed to only take one, but I just couldn’t understand why. It had been weeks since I took that first one. The risk of overdose was gone, assuming there ever even was a risk.


The pills seemed to beckon to me from the cabinet. Inaudibly begging for me to take another. I got up and slowly walked to the cabinet, removing the bottle. There had to be at least fifteen more in the bottle. Why would they sell so many if you were only intended to take a single dose. It didn’t make sense. 


I dumped one into my hand and noticed a chill in the air.  Another small, perfect circle day in the center of my palm. I tossed it up, into my mouth, allowing it to dissolve on my tongue. 


I went to my bedroom this time, fully expecting the drowse that accompanied. When that drowse never came, I found myself confused - manic, even. 


I went back to the pill bottle.


“One more couldn’t hurt,” I thought, frantic in an attempt to get the “creative juices” flowing again. I popped another into my mouth. 


I felt an overwhelming sense of dread creep over my body as I heard that voice. It was terrible, high pitched almost to the point of deafening. It spoke a single sentence….


“You were only meant to take one…” it said, snarling. 


I turned around to see something that turned my veins to ice. It was faint, like a shadow, or perhaps my vision had begun to blur. I couldn’t tell which was true. The shape lacked any detail, it was simply a blur of scattered colors. 


I recognized that blue. Where had I seen it? Why was it so seemingly familiar?


It stood in my doorway menacingly. It’s basic shape lacked any definition, as if it were vibrating at an insanely high speed. I took a step from the doorway. A slow, calculated step in my direction. As it approached, I noticed something swoop out from behind its back. More than one thing, four in total. 


Long, thin tendrils stretched out from behind it. They wriggled like snakes protruding from behind the thing. It continued its approach, methodical and horrifying. I stood, frozen in fear and gripped with anxiety. 


Without warning, the shadowy thing bolted for me, lunging and reaching out with not only it’s arms, but it’s wriggly tendrils, too. It grasped me by the throat, wrapping its thin, rope like appendages around my throat. 


“YOU WERE ONLY MEANT TO TAKE ONE” it shouted in that terrible, raspy voice. 


It’s grip tightened, strong around my throat. An intense pressure began to build behind my eyes. My lips began to sting and felt as if they would burst. I fought against it, choking and coughing as it lifted me up off the ground. My feet dangled helplessly underneath my body. 


Consciousness quickly left me.


When I came to, blue and red flashing lights penetrated myvision. A man stood over me, his fingers pressed down against my throat. A sudden surge of adrenaline brought with it a fighting force and I began writhing. It was no use, however. I had been subdued. 


“Calm down,” he said in a soothing voice. “Just relax. Breathe. Everything will be okay. My name is Daniel. I’m an EMT. It appears you were in some sort of accident. Can you tell me your name?”


“WHERE IS HE!” I shouted hysterically. 


“Who?” Daniel asked, looking around the living room. He was surrounded by police officers and other paramedics who all exchanged concerned looks. “We’re here alone. Now, please, I need you to tell me your name.”


I felt relief wash over me. Seeing those other people gave me some solace in knowing that I wasn’t around that thing anymore.


“M-my name is Jack. Jack Hillsborough.” I said, lowering my shaky voice and attempting to calm my nerves. 


“Good, Jack. Excellent.” He shined a light in my eyes, examining my pupils. “Can you tell me what happened?”



“Well,” I started. I wasn’t sure what to say. I didn’t think they’d believe me if I told them the truth. I opted for a quick, easy lie instead. “Someone broke in. Attacked me. Choked the shit out of me and knocked me out.”


It wasn’t all lies, more of an omission of the truth, really.


“Can you describe the assailant?” A large man with a thick, blonde mustache asked, stepping forward from behind the paramedic. His voice was deep and authoritative. 


I wasn’t sure what to say. 


Sure, he’s got 4 tentacles and no features. He’s pretty blurry, basically a shadow of a man. The only reason he showed up was because I took too many pills from this shady website that sent them to me for free. 


“Uhh,” I started. “He was tall. Thin. He was wearing a mask, so I couldn’t see his face. He sounded strange. Raspy voiced, like he smokes.” 


The officer took notes, listening intently as I explained. When I finished I had one question for him. 


“How’d you guys find me here?” I asked. 


“We received a call from a neighbor. Guess they heard the commotion and called it in.” His gruff voice echoed through my house. 


The paramedic interrupted, saying I needed to be transported to a hospital for a more thorough examination. I tried to say no, but he insisted saying that there could be some underlying damage. 


They loaded me up into the ambulance and took me off. The CT scan didn’t show any problems. No concussions or brain bleeds. Nothing on the x-ray either. I was released the same day. 


When I arrived, back at my house, I made a beeline for that plain white bottle. I was going to take the pills, empty the bottle into the toilet and flush them. To my surprise, and horror, the pills were gone. Vanished, without a trace. 


Then, I heard something rustling behind me, followed by the sound of someone clearing their throat. I froze in shock. My stomach began doing turns. 


“Looking for these,” that horrible, familiar voice said. I heard a rattle as it shook the bottle. When I turned, I was met with that blurred figure, standing in my living room. Tendrils outstretched from its body, wriggling horrifically. 


I immediately turned and ran from the house, not looking back. Knowing what that thing had done to me before only scared me and pushed me to run harder. I jumped into my car and drove. 


As the day grew dimmer, and night approached, I could swear I’d see that horrible shadow standing at every street corner. It would simply stare at me as I drove by. I’d pass him, and he would be at the next corner, as if by magic. His blurry outline holding that white bottle, tentacle extended out from behind him. 


I don’t know if he’ll ever stop chasing me. I don’t know if there’s any safe place for me now. As I type this, I’m constantly glancing back, over my shoulder. I know he’s watching me. Waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. I feel like I can still hear his voice. That raspy, gritty voice. 


It says only one thing.

It’s like your brain just won’t turn on. I had ten chapters due in two days and didn’t have a single word written, so I passed the time skimming the writing subreddits looking for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I saw the ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a tight deadline? Need help getting the creative juices flowing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link took me to a website that looked like it was designed in 1995. Text scrolled across the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our patented, proprietary formula can help you meet your tight deadline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuckin’ scammers,” I said, moving the mouse to the top of the page to exit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could click the red “X,” a text box appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is not a scam!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only option was to click OK, so I did. I was taken to a page featuring a large photo of a pill bottle with a plain white label. The words “Creative Juices” were scribbled in black permanent marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, okay,” I thought, and again tried to exit the site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pop-up appeared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Try our patented, proprietary formula today at no cost to you!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I attempted to quit the browser entirely. It wouldn’t. I restarted my computer. The window was there upon launch. Now the pop-up was more insistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Try it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clicked OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken to a form asking for my name and address. No credit card or bank account info. I entered a fake name, the P.O. Box I used for Amazon, and clicked Submit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you! Please check your mailbox tomorrow!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognized that blue. Where had I seen it? Why was it so seemingly familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stood in my doorway menacingly. It’s basic shape lacked any definition, as if it were vibrating at an insanely high speed. I took a step from the doorway. A slow, calculated step in my direction. As it approached, I noticed something swoop out from behind its back. More than one thing, four in total. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long, thin tendrils stretched out from behind it. They wriggled like snakes protruding from behind the thing. It continued its approach, methodical and horrifying. I stood, frozen in fear and gripped with anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without warning, the shadowy thing bolted for me, lunging and reaching out with not only it’s arms, but it’s wriggly tendrils, too. It grasped me by the throat, wrapping its thin, rope like appendages around my throat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“YOU WERE ONLY MEANT TO TAKE ONE” it shouted in that terrible, raspy voice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s grip tightened, strong around my throat. An intense pressure began to build behind my eyes. My lips began to sting and felt as if they would burst. I fought against it, choking and coughing as it lifted me up off the ground. My feet dangled helplessly underneath my body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consciousness quickly left me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to, blue and red flashing lights penetrated myvision. A man stood over me, his fingers pressed down against my throat. A sudden surge of adrenaline brought with it a fighting force and I began writhing. It was no use, however. I had been subdued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Calm down,” he said in a soothing voice. “Just relax. Breathe. Everything will be okay. My name is Daniel. I’m an EMT. It appears you were in some sort of accident. Can you tell me your name?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“WHERE IS HE!” I shouted hysterically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who?” Daniel asked, looking around the living room. He was surrounded by police officers and other paramedics who all exchanged concerned looks. “We’re here alone. Now, please, I need you to tell me your name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt relief wash over me. Seeing those other people gave me some solace in knowing that I wasn’t around that thing anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“M-my name is Jack. Jack Hillsborough.” I said, lowering my shaky voice and attempting to calm my nerves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good, Jack. Excellent.” He shined a light in my eyes, examining my pupils. “Can you tell me what happened?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well,” I started. I wasn’t sure what to say. I didn’t think they’d believe me if I told them the truth. I opted for a quick, easy lie instead. “Someone broke in. Attacked me. Choked the shit out of me and knocked me out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all lies, more of an omission of the truth, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can you describe the assailant?” A large man with a thick, blonde mustache asked, stepping forward from behind the paramedic. His voice was deep and authoritative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure what to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, he’s got 4 tentacles and no features. He’s pretty blurry, basically a shadow of a man. The only reason he showed up was because I took too many pills from this shady website that sent them to me for free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Uhh,” I started. “He was tall. Thin. He was wearing a mask, so I couldn’t see his face. He sounded strange. Raspy voiced, like he smokes.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The officer took notes, listening intently as I explained. When I finished I had one question for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How’d you guys find me here?” I asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We received a call from a neighbor. Guess they heard the commotion and called it in.” His gruff voice echoed through my house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paramedic interrupted, saying I needed to be transported to a hospital for a more thorough examination. I tried to say no, but he insisted saying that there could be some underlying damage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They loaded me up into the ambulance and took me off. The CT scan didn’t show any problems. No concussions or brain bleeds. Nothing on the x-ray either. I was released the same day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, back at my house, I made a beeline for that plain white bottle. I was going to take the pills, empty the bottle into the toilet and flush them. To my surprise, and horror, the pills were gone. Vanished, without a trace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I heard something rustling behind me, followed by the sound of someone clearing their throat. I froze in shock. My stomach began doing turns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Looking for these,” that horrible, familiar voice said. I heard a rattle as it shook the bottle. When I turned, I was met with that blurred figure, standing in my living room. Tendrils outstretched from its body, wriggling horrifically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately turned and ran from the house, not looking back. Knowing what that thing had done to me before only scared me and pushed me to run harder. I jumped into my car and drove. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the day grew dimmer, and night approached, I could swear I’d see that horrible shadow standing at every street corner. It would simply stare at me as I drove by. I’d pass him, and he would be at the next corner, as if by magic. His blurry outline holding that white bottle, tentacle extended out from behind him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if he’ll ever stop chasing me. I don’t know if there’s any safe place for me now. As I type this, I’m constantly glancing back, over my shoulder. I know he’s watching me. Waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. I feel like I can still hear his voice. That raspy, gritty voice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says only one thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You were only meant to take one…”&lt;/p&gt;

When it all began two years ago, we didn’t tell each other much about it. It was our third year together as a young married couple and our first time living in a landed house together. Even if we’d bettered our means of communication—which is tactile sign language and lip-reading—it’s still hard to convey these kinds of things when I’m blind and my wife, Cheryl, is a deaf-mute. So, for the first few months living in our new home, when we experienced strange things, we simply chalked it up to our minds playing tricks on us. 

One of my first experiences was hearing the whimpering voice of a lady in the kitchen. It didn’t sound like my wife, and even if it was, it didn’t click with logic because Cheryl is a mute, and I've never *ever* heard her voice before. More than that, she was standing directly beside me on my right side, but the voice was coming from the upper-left corner of the kitchen. As soon as I turned my head in that direction, the soft whimpering faded. This was around the fifth time I’d heard something peculiar in the house, and one of the more intense of the first few times, but it was still too subtle to make such a big deal about it. My hearing is sharp, the natural compensation for my blindness, and it’d be hard for an average person to have picked up on it; it was *that* subtle. 

On the other hand, Cheryl was a little bit more suspecting of our situation from the get-go, with her vision being as clear as a sniper’s. In the very moment that I heard the voice, out of the corner of her eye, she’d seen the mangled body of a young lady in the upper-left corner of the kitchen ceiling. When my wife looked directly at her, there was nothing there, so she’d just rubbed her eyes and carried on with her day. Cheryl did, however, see me turn my head at the same time she did. 

Still and all, we were caught in disbelief for the first few stages of the strange occurrences, and that is a stupid mistake on our part; we should’ve picked up on it and put the pieces together sooner rather than later, because later would be too late. 

It was around the tenth encounter with something odd when Cheryl had taken my hand and signed the words “Did you hear anything?” and I nodded yes. Some of you may think it’s funny, but we were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV, because this is the activity that peaks our communication and bonding. She tactile signs me what I can’t see, and I sign her the things she can’t hear. “What did you hear?” she signed on my hand. 

“A man groaning.”

What she’d signed on my hand after that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand. “There was a bloodied hand on the ground near your feet.” I’m blind, but I knew we were both looking at each other with our mouths hung open in horror. That event would signify the escalating intensity of our circumstances. Call us stupid, but we brushed it off as—yup, you called it—our minds playing tricks on us. After all, we were watching a horror film. Our imagination can get overactive. 

The phenomenon would persist, whether only a sighting or only a sound. Sometimes an episode will be greater than another. I heard stomping on our ceiling. Cheryl saw our faces distort in one of our wedding pictures, into twisted grimaces of fear and pain. I heard scratching coming from our knife rack. Cheryl saw fading handprint stains on our storeroom door. 

Creaking on one tread of our stairs that has a loose floorboard. A disfigured child’s head looking down from the second-floor stair railing. More loose floorboards creaking. Half a face peeking through a crack in the curtains. Laughing in the living room. Disembodied feet running across us. The thumping of the footsteps. 

All of this—*and more*—in the span of a year and a half, and by then, it’s obviously too much to shrug off and ignore. We’d investigated the history of the house, looked up the contacts of previous tenants and phoned them. To our surprise, the house’s history is as clean as a whistle, and no other tenant had experienced any such cases. In fact, they’d add that it is a beautiful home and they miss staying in it. We were at a loss and were practically glued to each other in fear every moment of our time staying there. 

The breaking point was in the middle of the night when we were sleeping, I woke up to our TV going off on full blast. I shot off from bed and practically yanked on Cheryl’s hand until she was awake, on her feet and standing beside me. Together, we tread down the stairs, all the way down to the living room, the TV white noise getting louder, louder in my ears. I turned back to Cheryl behind me, her hand in mine, and I mouthed the words, “What do you see?”

Then, a lady’s voice, right up in my ear: “There is no escape.” At that same moment, another hand grabbed my other hand and pulled me away. Right there and then, I knew that this new person was the real Cheryl peeling me away from the company of something or someone else, so I let her drag me to wherever she was taking me. 

She led me outside, the two of us running in our pajamas, without shoes, me losing my footing going down the entrance steps and almost falling. We ran until we were far away from the house. Judging by the gravel under my feet, I think we were standing in the roadside. Then, she immediately held me tight and began sobbing. It took me a long while to register what had happened because of the shock, but as soon as I caught onto the situation, I was crying along with her. 

From what she told me a few days after, when we were sleeping that night, she woke up to get a glass of water. Although we agreed not to leave each other’s side while in that house, she thought it to be too much to drag me along for a short trip to the kitchen. While she was there, the TV backlight lit up the living room, so she went to check it out. 

She tinkered around with the TV remote and power button, but it wouldn’t turn off, so she unplugged it. Still no response. The TV kept on going, lighting up the whole living room. At that point, she was freaking out. Then, she turned around to find me walking down the stairs hand-in-hand with someone else. Cheryl refused to describe what this other girl looked like and about what had happened after the girl leaned into my ear and whispered. 

This was all conveyed to me in our stay with our friend from college, a man capable of speech, hearing and sight. Cheryl and I thought it best to stay with him for a week, given to a few factors such as his bachelorship, his living stability, and his nature to always lend a giving hand and an attentive ear. We wouldn’t bother a wife, wouldn’t leave a dent in his finances, and would have a helpful friend with us. The only downside: he was a sceptic and, with all that we told him about, he was seriously considering sending us to a therapist. 

For five days, we stayed with Cameron. In four nights, we turned a sceptic into a believer. When I heard tapping on the wall, he heard it. When Cheryl saw a handprint on the window, he saw it. But what really freaked him out, was the fourth night. All of us came out of our rooms with the sound of loud banging on the wall in the living room. 

When we all converged in the corridor, Cameron was cussing in whispers to no end. “What is that? What in the hell is that? I think there’s someone there, in the corner there. It’s too bloody dark.”

We all edged closer to the living room. Given Cheryl’s higher than average ability to see in the dark, she was very much reluctant to proceed any further because she could see exactly what it was, but she didn’t want to be left behind, so she followed along. Cameron flicked the light switch on, and all I hear from then on is chaos. There’s a man shouting in agony, banging on the wall, and Cameron’s crying out cusses, and Cheryl’s tugging on our arms, pulling us away. 

One of the last things I heard as we backed away, back into the corridor, was a man shouting, “THEY’RE COMING! THEY’RE COMING!”

As soon as we’d all backed up all the way into the guest room we were staying at, the shouting man faded along with the banging, and Cameron’s cussing finally tapered away. We’d all ended up spending a sleepless night in the same room, talking until daylight broke and Cameron couldn’t hold his eyes open anymore.  

For some things, Cheryl and I don’t even need to communicate. It’s an almost sixth sense connection about us. We can come to a mutual agreement without needing tactile sign language or lip reading. We’d been together for *that* long… since middle-school, two kids sitting alone on a lonely bench. Honestly, I never would’ve known she existed—how’s a blind boy supposed to know if a deaf-mute girl exists, right? She’d approached me and tried communicating with me using tactile sign language that we hadn’t even developed yet. She’d taken my hands and tapped them against her ears and mouth, then shook her head no. At first, I didn’t know *at all* what was going on, but we managed, and I understood, and we hit it off. The best days came from that day onwards. 

On the fifth morning staying with Cameron, while he slept in our room, Cheryl silently packed up our belongings, and I sat against the bed’s headrest with my head in my hands. And then we left, leaving behind a note for Cameron. 

“As much as you want to, do not help us. Thank you for being the best of friends and always being there for us, but we can’t drag you into this. This is something we must take on alone.”

All the countless phone calls we got from him, we rejected. Later, Cheryl would do some research on her phone and find a picture of the man she’d seen from last night, a murder victim. She told me that the guy was a stubby, balding, bearded man with down syndrome, but she wouldn’t tell me how he’d appeared to us last night. I’d imagine that it was a disfigured version of him, but that’s just a guess. 

Our heads were brimmed with questions and we couldn’t put together the pieces of the jigsaw. If we’d done our investigation even a tad sooner, we would’ve been more prepared for what was to come. That night, in all our lack of sleep, we headed to bed, ready to begin looking further into the situation the next day…

But we were a day too late. In the middle of the night, I heard footsteps and voices, things going on downstairs and so I woke Cheryl up. In no less than two seconds, she gripped onto me tightly and began shivering. 

Then, ever so quietly that it nearly slipped my hearing, a child’s scratchy, damaged voice on my left…

This happened when I was 15 years old. Me and my mother lived in this really big house in a very fancy yet welcoming society. My mother was a single parent and struggled to make ends meet. We lived in the family house, and as I remember my grandmother telling me, our family was one of the richest and most popular in our area. She had died a few years back. I was very close with her. Here’s a bit of the story she told me that you need to understand before I can continue:

The house we lived in belonged to my great grandmother’s brother. He was a priest, a really famous one. People used to flock at our house back then, asking him for favors and they even used to sleep outside our house, at night, hoping to see him in the morning. I don’t remember her telling me why. He did not have any superpowers or anything, he was just, famous and liked by everyone. I’m not going to lie; I felt a bit proud to have had someone like that in my family. I always thought that he must have been a really kind and generous priest.  We kept all his belongings in a prayer room just beside our living room. He used to spend a lot of time in that room, praying. We never opened that room, partly because it was really dusty and we didn’t have the time to clean it up regularly. It looked like the typical dark creepy room we see in horror movies. And I was never bothered by it. I should have been.

It was at the time of my exams. We had almost a month as study leave, and I was excited. I was a pretty big nerd back then, especially since I realized how my mother struggled to support me. I would study for hours at night. I studied in the living room, and usually went to sleep at around 2 am. At midnight I would take a quick power nap in the couch so that I can study for at least 1 more hour. My mother would be asleep at that time in her room. As usual, at midnight, I was taking my nap. I didn’t fall asleep yet, but my eyes were closed. In that brief moment, when you lose consciousness and fall to sleep, I felt something on my hand. I quickly opened my eyes to see something move past quickly into the prayer room. I froze, I couldn’t move. I didn’t think anything, do anything, I just laid there. It took a few seconds for me to react. I ran as fast I could to my mother’s room. She woke up. I explained what had happened to her. She smiled and asked me to take some rest. She thought I was working hard too hard lately. I didn’t sleep that night. I stayed in her room. Thinking of ways to make myself believe that it was just a nightmare. But I couldn’t. 

The next day I tried to convince my mother that there was something wrong in that room, but she eventually grew tired of me. She opened the room after a long time to prove to me that there was nothing wrong. When I saw the room, for some reason, I felt a bit relieved. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just some old pictures and clothes and stuff. “Hmm, that’s strange”, my mother said. “What?” I asked. “I don’t remember this picture being here” It was a picture of the priest, a very big one. I could sense the feeling of regret when my mother saw my face. “I don’t remember it, that’s all, will you stop with all of this?” I sighed. But I was sure I saw something. I couldn’t focus on my studies like I used to after that.

My mother eventually had to call her sister to home one day because of how I behaved. She told my aunt to make me understand that there are no ghosts in our house. My aunt was really close with me. She was a really cool lady, and used to do a lot of practical jokes. She also made the most sense when she talked so I too trusted her to solve this madness. I was a bit surprised by the way she greeted me. Usually she starts off with some sarcastic joke. But this is what happened:

Aunt: “Are you okay?”

Me: “Yeah, in a way, I need to…”

Aunt: “Let’s go upstairs”

She literally grabbed me to the room upstairs. I thought that she was really mad at me for giving my mother so much troubles

Aunt: “Tell me everything you know, saw, anything….”

I was a bit afraid of her reaction but managed to spill out what had happened.

Aunt: “What did it look like?”

That question took me out of the blue. I did not remember what it looked like. I couldn’t describe anything about it. I was very confident that I saw something moving, but I could not describe it.

Me: “Maybe it was a nightmare as my mother said”

Aunt: “No, it’s real”

Me: “What!?”

Aunt: “Sheesh, be quiet, don’t tell your mother about this. She will not like it. And don’t be afraid, I’m here with you”

Me: “okay? What’s going on?”

Aunt: “Do you remember that priest we had in our family?”

Me: “Yes, grandma told me about him”

Aunt: “What did she tell you?

Me: “That he was a really popular, rich guy at that time. He was very kind and …”

Aunt: “He’s crazy”

I just sat there looking at her with my mouth open like an idiot. I genuinely didn’t know what to reply to that.

Aunt: “Listen, what am I about to tell you is going to sound crazy, but I want you to listen carefully. I think you’re old enough to know about this, and promise you won’t tell your mom about this”

Me: “I promise”

Aunt: “Everyone knows that priest as a good guy, who helped people. But how can a priest that good, get so much money? That’s because he was not really a priest. I believe he used to do black magic. Or something like demonic rituals. In that room. Where you saw it. Nobody knows how he got the money to build this house in the first place. And secondly, he grew richer while he lived here and how? Church doesn’t give out that much money. People used to give him money for things they wanted to happen. Most of which I believe, not something good”

Me: “Aunty, please don’t make fun of me, I was serious about what I said before”, I said while almost in tears

Aunt: “Weren’t you listening? I’m saying the truth! Everything I said is true. And the most important thing – this house is cursed. No man can stay here for too long. Do you understand what I mean?”

I suddenly realized what she meant. My grandmother and mother, both were divorced way early in their life. I was in fact the only guy who stayed this long in this house, after maybe that priest. I was about to cry. I never thought things would come to this. My aunt hugged me and comforted me. I will never forget that, her words that day gave me strength to live in that house.

Aunt: “Listen, nothing is going to happen to you. I had to say this, I know it’s too much for you, especially at this time. Listen, your mother knows all about this, but she doesn’t like anybody talking ill about our family. I have urged her many times to sell this house, knowing its history. Even before she got married. She just won’t listen to me. You have to make her understand. Tell her it’s too big. Or that you need somewhere close to school. And don’t worry, just call me if anything happens, I’ll always support you”

When she left, I was thinking of how I could persuade my mother to sell it. It was almost midnight. I was sitting in the couch staring at that room. I was wondering what to do. Is my aunt telling the truth? Maybe she wants the house to herself? But she’s always been good to us. Is it even safe for us to be living here?

And then it happened. The door of that room opened. The door, which was locked with a key was opened. It was just dark inside. I couldn’t move again. I froze. I thought I had no way to escape this. When I could regain control of my body, I sprung out of the couch, ran as fast as the wind could carry me and woke up my mother. She was absolutely annoyed at me and told her to follow me. I prayed to all the gods in the world, to let the door stay open. It was. “How did you open this?”, she asked me with great curiosity. “Mom, please?” I was angry at her this time for ignoring me all this time. She looked at the drawer in her room and the key was there. My mother knew that I wouldn’t stage all this. She made me a cup of coffee that night, and for the first time comforted me by saying that everything was going to be alright. I begged her to sell  the house. She promised. We didn’t sleep that night.

Early morning, we called Aunty. My mother and her had some heated discussion that I was not allowed to listen to. Afterwards my aunt comforted me and said that there is nothing to be afraid of anymore. We lived at aunt’s house for some while before finding a house closer to my school and renting there. We rented the old house and never lived there again.

I know you might be thinking that I was just paranoid and seeing things. But this is what happened afterwards we moved with my aunt. My father came back to us. After a few fights and meetups, my parents are back together. I couldn’t be happier for them. Also, the couple that lived in our house before, when we rented it, lost the husband to a fire. The house was damaged and we didn’t repair it. My mother knew for sure that there was something wrong. Apparently, my father felt there was something wrong too. We are planning to completely destroy it and do something good out of it. Maybe give it to an orphanage or sell it and use the money to help some poor families.

I’m bent over a log in the dirt...I eagerly, with trembling fingers, reached for my knife that’s been embedded into my calf.  The sweat on my forehead felt like a slow touch from God beckoning me to plead for forgiveness; as if these were my last few breaths.  Each breath emitted a demonic whisper that subconsciously took over my lips. “Let the burning release you,” they gurgle in my ear, taunting my last breaths.  I feel ache across my entire body. I don’t remember anything before this moment. Before, I must’ve slipped over the bark, causing the knife to flip and hook under my skin.  I could feel the soggy moss saturating the bark. It made for a slippery trap I have fallen into. My breaths were returning to me. Although I could still hear the whispers, “let the burning release you,” piercing my ear drums.  My eyes finally found focus, a dense forest covered the black sky. Ahead, were patches of fog, seeping into the dirt as if the Earth were inhaling. As I regained my senses the knife digging into my bone started getting more intense.  I had to relea...release it from my calf.  


I gently and slowly pull the blade from out of my leg.  Sharp pains run through my leg as if it were happening for the first time.  My vision returns to a static state. The forest bends in front of me as the last few centimeters of the blade release.  The moment it leaves my skin, slender faces appear in the fog as they gurgle in the distance. I begin panting. They move closer.  I have no choice but to escape by hopping on my only usable leg. My ears begin to sting when suddenly the fog clears...my vision returns once more.  I look down to check the wound… It's gone and I feel no pain but something doesn't feel right…


I rest on a boulder nearest me hoping to find some clarity as to what happened previous to slipping.  My thoughts seem to be pacing and scattered without direction. The only thought that stands out, as if my gut were screaming it into my head, that I should have never removed the knife.  I tried to fight it off for how stupid it sounded. I shook my head vigorously. “What the fuck is going on!?” I shouted into the negative spaces of the forest, as if I expected an answer.  I choose to stand up. My feet sink into the wet ground as I begin walking. The fog in the forest has thickened behind me… The ground seems to get even more wet the further I walk…I know not where I go...I only hope I find an exit.


I look up, scanning the skies and the tops of the creaking trees.  I clench to my shirt drenched in sweat. My nails digging into my palms, knuckles turning white.  My body feels as a statue as I see peeling eyes at the tops of the trees. I feel a desperate urge to scream but the scream feels caught in my throat; the only mechanism of panic feels like it's being pulled back into my lungs and I stop breathing.  The eyes darken but never lose their gaze. Someone's fingers lock onto my ankles…

I freeze in place.  Long fingers curl their way into my skin, yanking my ankles downward.  I taste sour in my mouth with rushing thoughts of a dozen ways this might end.  Too terrified to look what is grasping me, I look up once more. Swollen eyes seem to have dripped down the trees like sap.  My legs go numb, I squeeze my eyes shut, exhaling as if it were my last. What felt like not even a second every ache, burn, or grasp I had felt was gone.  I open my eyes to find myself in the same place but something is different; I stand betwixt two hooded figures. They wear torn, heavy drapes. I could tell the drapes were heavy by the way it pulled down their skin.  As I hold my gaze on their molten skinned faces, they whisper echoes of a tongue that almost sounds alien. Before I could think of anything to say, they turn to me and place their palms on my forehead.

What else did I have to do to make them believe me? Forgive me humankind. I'm so sorry, but God knows I've tried.  


OK.  


I just need to relax for a minute, so I can put some order in my head because I don't even know where to start.  


Long story short: I'm a mind time traveler. Yes, I know you don't believe... FUCK YOU TOO. I don't care. Maybe that's the reason most of you are going to die.  


Listen!  


It's true. I've traveled in time, but with my mind. I'm not physically there, that's not possible (yet). My body stays here, but, with my mind, I can interact with other humans in their time. I talk to people in the future or in the past.  


I'm a former employee of a nameless secret division, overseen by the CIA in collaboration with JPL and the Pentagon's DIA. They run (they still do) this nonsense program where a bunch of idiots like me travels in time to gather information.  


I'm an orphan from a third world country. I was recruited when I was seven, just like my other ""workmates"", so if any of us die in any experiment, nobody will miss us and look for us.  


I've seen things that will make any adult crazy because everything that you'd see in these experiments defies logic as we understand it. That's the other reason why they chose us very young, because our brain, at that age, is very malleable, we believe in what we are seeing as if we ""pretend play"" or ""make-believe"". A kid's brain accepts unrealistic scenarios way easier than an adult brain because the adult one is already formed and it will fight the logic of what you are seeing with what you think the reality is or should be.  


They have been running experiments with orphans for over 70 years and I'm one of the few that has survived dozens of experiments and hundreds of mind trips for two decades in that horrible place.  


My last mind trip was in 2014. I traveled to the year 2125. I met with agents from the same agency in that time (fuck them too, I had hopes that they'd disappear in the future, but sadly, they won't). They showed me what COVID-19 was. How it started, how it spread, and how it wiped out almost 40% of the worldwide population.  


It was terrifying. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I cried and screamed at them! How is this even possible? Why nobody did anything about it?  


I was wrong. They are doing something about it. That's why I was there. They brought me there. They hacked my mind trip to show me what happened so I could warn others.  


I was their savior. All of a sudden, I became humankind's last hope.  


I was there for three weeks, traveling inside my mind, learning as much as possible. My body was in my present time, 2014, in an induced coma for the same amount of time.  


And then, I came back. I woke up terrified. Crying, like a little kid. Scared as shit.  


They thought I lost my mind, that I had a bad trip. I don't blame them. That has happened before. They've seen countless of bad trips happening to others. For God's sake, I've even seen them happening to my ""friends"". And once you have a bad trip, you are done. You become a vegetable. Your brain is fried. You get lost in your own mind, where all the realities that you have visited become one big shit hole where nothing makes sense.  


But my brain wasn't fried. I was fine. I was just fucking scared.  


They put me in quarantine, where I had a mental evaluation every day, three times a day. They wrote everything down. I explained everything I saw. I gave them names, people involved, billionaires, governments, anything they needed to know to stop it, and if they couldn't stop it, I gave them the formula of the vaccine. They have THE VACCINE right now!  


But they don't want to use it!  


The people that were in charge wanted this to happen! They wanted to eradicate the population so they can declare martial law and we will be more controllable. But their plan will fail. The agents of the future told me that that plan didn't work because the virus mutated to a form that nobody expected. It became way bigger than what anybody could imagine.  


When the virus evolves, they won't be able to control it anymore. They will regret it. Believe me, I've seen their guilt in istheir eyes in the future.  


Unfortunately, even though I had all this information with me, nobody listened to me.  


After a month locked up, they determined I wasn't fit to travel again, so I was discharged, meaning that they were going to kill me.  


I escaped.  


Two decades with them taught me a few tricks about disappearing. So I ran. I'm still running and I will never stop. I know they will eventually catch me. I'm sure of that, but I'm not going to make it easier for them.  


Good luck to you. You are going to need it. We all do.

,nosleep,"Damascus international airport hadn't changed much since the last time I had been here. Granted, I could no longer hear the thundering explosions that rumbled across the sky, rattling the very roots of the building, or the echoing gunshots that sounded way too close for comfort. But everything else was still the same, almost disconcertingly so; from the fearful expressions that would occasionally slip out and spread across the faces of the sparse crowd of mostly domestic travellers, to the sandbag fortifications in every nook and cranny of the place, manned by regime soldiers with permanent scowls marring their careworn foreheads and the plush sofas of the lounge that looked like they hadn't aged a day in the last eight years. Hell, I even recognised one of the guys manning the check in counters. 

*The more things change, the more they stay the same...* Indeed. 

A stabbing pain emanating from my knees crackled up my synapses as I walked towards the exit, a throbbing reminder of why I so destested this place. Gritting my teeth to block out the pain, I passed through the automatic sliding glass doors, pulling my suitcase across the tiled floor, making its old wheels groan and squeal in protest and eliciting annoyed looks from those around me. A pleasantly cool breeze welcomed me outside, and I felt the warm rays of the late morning sun wash over my skin. It certainly would have been a beautiful day, if it hadn't been for the man waiting for me on the steps near the doors with a shit eating grin on his face. 

""Murtaza."" He took his hands out of his pockets and pulled me in for a bone crushing hug, before pulling back and letting his bemused emerald eyes scan my face. ""Damn... You got old."" 

I groaned. ""Yes, Liam. That's what 8 excruciatingly long years do to people."" Not to him, apparently. He looked every bit as handsome as he did the last time I had seen him, with not even a single strand of his short wavy blonde hair out of place, quiet unlike my own follicularly challenged self. 

""Touche. Growing old's a bitch, isn't it?"" He asked wistfully. I didn't bother to reply. 

We made small talk, catching up on what the two of us had been upto in the past decade as we strolled over to where he had parked his car, dancing around the topic we really needed to have a discussion on, with the two of us being far too professional to do that where someone could easily eavesdrop. As we cleared the many checkpoints surrounding the airport and went deep into the city, we settled into a companionable silence as the emaciated Barada river pathetically burbled along next to us. I rested my head on the cool window of the car and gazed at the nauseatingly familiar skyline of the city. All this sight was missing was plumes of thick, black smoke rising upwards in the distant horizon and it would have felt like I had travelled back in time. 

Our journey eventually ended at a deceptively abandoned looking dilapidated school building situated in the outskirts of the city. As we drove through the rusted iron gates, kicking up dust in the process, I could feel eyes on me. My suspicions were confirmed when I spotted snipers on the roof. 

""You wanna tell me what the fuck the US military is doing this deep in regime territory?"" I asked Liam who was looking at me in the rear view mirror. 

""Well, it's all about why you're here… No, why *we're* here."" 

""So, why exactly are we here?"" I asked.

He sighed, taking one hand off the wheel and rubbing his eyes. ""It's bad, Murtaza... Really bad."" 

""As bad as the last time?"" 

He snorted. ""Worse, much worse. Last time was nothing compared to this. This thing's got everybody spooked. I've been getting calls from people I should never be getting calls from. I hauled ass and arrived here as soon as I could."" 

""What in the fuck happened?""

""A couple of weeks ago, the US military carried out a raid against a high ranking Tahrir al-Sham commander in the north... It didn't work out quite like they thought it would, in fact it was a damn mess. Everybody died.""

I raised my eyebrow. ""And I'm guessing it wasn't just an ambush by the terrorists.""

He shook his head. ""No, it certainly wasn't. We wouldn't be here if it was, now would we? No... They got it all on camera, man. Shit's really fucked. Never seen anything like it in my life."" 

That was quite a statement, considering the kind of shit we come across in our line of work. We piled out of the car and walked into the school, which served as a makeshift military base, populated by what seemed to be essential personnel only, to keep it all under wraps, I presume. Liam introduced us to the officer in command, and together we strode into what used to be the staff room of the school, now with monitors lining the walls from the floor to the ceiling. The officer gave us files containing a radio transcript of the operation and instructed one of his men to fire up some of the monitors and show us the video. 

*

We began with the strike team sliding down the ropes of the helicopter which sent sand spiralling up into the air with its powerful rotating blades. Judging by the greyish hue of the video, I deduced it was a nighttime operation, and we were looking through cameras mounted on the helmets of the soldiers. The radio crackled and they began communicating, and I had to look at the file once again to check the call signs. 

HA - Hotel Actual. (The strike team). 
H21 - Sniper spotter team. 
DP - Dog pound. (Transport helicopter).
C - Command. 

**HA - Command, Hotel Actual. Come in, over.**

The soldiers had descended and were spread out into a lose circle. They were in a rural area, and I could barely make out some old and beaten down structures in the background. The guy whose camera we were following must have been the team leader, since he was the one communicating, with his thumb on the radio on his shoulder. We heard a disembodied voice blaring from the radio as command replied. 

**C - Hotel Actual, Command. Receiving, over**

**HA - We're coming up on the compound now. We'll locate and neutralise the target while Hotel 2-1 provides overwatch. How copy, over?** 

Two of the soldiers broke away from the group and disappeared into the darkness. 

**C - Affirmative. Make sure you get a PID on the target before you engage. We're trying to avoid civilian casualties here.** 

**HA - Roger that. Over and out.** 

With their weapons drawn, the team moved as a unit towards its target, which became clearer the closer they got to it. It was a two storied building with paint peeling off the walls, some of which were crumbling so badly that I could make out the house's brick and cement skeletal structure underneath. The team assembled behind the boundary wall, and I saw one of the soldier's eyes glow under the glare from the camera as the team leader looked at him. The radio sputtered again. 

**H21 - Hotel Actual, Hotel 2-1. We are in position overlooking the compound, over.** 

**HA - Hotel 2-1, Hotel Actual, copy. Maintain eyes on target, and identify and neutralise any hostiles. Be advised, civilians are still in the area, so get a PID before engaging, over.** 

**H21 - Roger, Hotel Actual. Over and out.** 

The team leader craned his neck and the helicopter appeared as a small figure in the screen, hovering in the grey sky some distance away from the strike team. 

*""Looks like Dog Pound's covering our asses. Alright boys, let's get this shit done and go back to our warm ass beds.""* He barked some orders and the soldiers began storming the house. They swung the gate open, and entered the yard, fanning out to cover all possible entrances. The team leader had reached the front door when his radio interrupted him once again. 

**DP - Hotel Actual. I'm seeing movement to your southwest, over.** 

**HA - What was that, Dog Pound? Are we cleared to advance?** 

**DP - Negative. Hold position. Over.** 

**DP - Hotel 2-1. Do you have eyes on?** 

**H21 - Affirmative. Hotel Actual, you have an unidentified individual about a 100 metres to the southwest, unarmed. Proceed with caution.** 

""Take us to the sniper team, please."" Liam requested the man working on the computer who changed the view on the screen with a couple of rapid clicks. The scene shifted, and we were now on top of the roof of a nearby building, looking down at Hotel Actual from the back. ""There."" Liam said, pointing at the right bottom corner of the screen. ""Do you see it?"" I nodded, I could faintly make out an unusually tall figure stalking the strike team. The sniper repositioned his gun, and the figure became slightly clearer, but not much. ""Alright."" Liam continued, ""take us back."" 

We came back to the team leader of Hotel Actual who quickly gave orders to his men using some hand signals and retraced his steps to investigate. 

**HA - Roger, Hotel 2-1. We see him.** 

*""Hold!""* The team leader shouted. *""US forces. Put your hands up.""* The figure disregarded the command and continued to move closer. *""Stop. Turn around and walk away. Or we will fire on you.""* 

The figure moved in a little closer, and my heart jumped out of my mouth as I saw him for the first time. He was tall, much taller than what I had assumed him to be, clad in some black robe, probably a kaftan or a thawb, with a keffiyeh tied up like a turban on his head. His lips were stretched into an unnaturally wide and still smile, as if that expression was forever frozen on his face, an expression that oozed maliciousness. His skin was so pale that light seemed to bounce off him, like some fucked up miniature moon. But the most disturbing thing about him were his eyes, two giant glowing orbs that burnt like the sun. *""What the fuck?""* The team leader swore, and he was joined by the other soldiers.  *""Do you see his eyes, Sergeant.""* *""What the fuck is that?""* 

I couldn't help but shiver at the sheer evil emanating from this thing. The team leader was faster at getting over the shock of it all than I was. 

**HA - Command, be advised. There is a… civilian near our position.""**

**C - Hotel Actual, are you positive he's not armed?** 

Before the team leader could reply, the man with the glowing eyes just disappeared with a loud pop, and the screen shook wildly as the soldiers began to panic. *""What the fuck?""* *""Where did he go?""* 

An anguish filled scream ripped through the soldiers, making the team leader swing his head in the direction of the sound. 

**C - Hotel Actual, come in.** 

When the camera stabilised we saw that the man with the glowing eyes had stabbed one of the soldiers through the chest with his bare hand and was now dangling the poor bastard in the air like a rag doll. He pulled his hand free, and turned his head sharply to look at the team leader, his smile somehow stretching even wider. *""Sh.. Shoot it!""* The Sergeant shouted, pulling his gun up, but his finger froze with fear when the man opened his mouth, his jaw dropping low enough to touch his chest, and screeched, with the sound so low and animalistic it made those of us watching the video wince. Muzzle flashes lit up the screen as the soldiers fired at the man but he disappeared almost instantly, causing the bullets to sail through the air harmlessly.

**DP - Command, this Dog Pound 2-5, we're observing small arms fire going off in Hotel Actual's position. I repeat, shots fired.** 

**C - How many combatants are engaging them, Dog Pound?** 

**DP - Do you copy that, Hotel 2-1? Can you identify the number of combatants engaging Hotel Actual, over?** 

**H21 - Dog Pound. It's… a blur. I can't see what's going on.** 

The strike team was being picked off one by one, with the attacker being too fast for the frightened soldiers to handle. That, *thing*, wasn't content with just killing them. He was taunting them, taking his time to extend their suffering, and mocking them. At one point he ripped off the arms of one of the soldiers and used them to wave at the team leader. Sickening stuff. 

**HA - THIS IS HOTEL ACTUAL. SOMETHING IS TEARING APART OUR MEN. FUCK. SHOOT IT. REQUESTING BACKUP IMMEDIATELY.** 

The next second, the man with the glowing eyes appeared right in front of the team leader, his face just inches from the camera. I could almost feel the rot and decay in his skin, even as the glow from his eyes consumed half the screen. Then the team leader's head jerked to the side with a horrible crunch and he fell over backwards, the camera hitting the ground lens first, taking away all visibility. Liam whispered something, and the view subsequently changed to the sniper team's position. 

**H21 - Hotel Actual, come in. Steve! Rodriguez!... Dog Pound, Hotel Actual is in heavy combat and requires backup, can you fly in and assist, over?** 

**DP - Roger. We're flying in now. Keep providing overwatch and look out for RPGs.** 

**H21 - Affirmative. But be advised, Hotel Actual's position has gone completely dark. We see no movement, whatsoever.** 

The overwhelming sound of the helicopter took over as Dog Pound approached the scene of the carnage.  
""Does Dog Pound not have a camera?"" I asked softly. ""It did."" Liam replied solemnly.

**DP - Hotel 2-1, we're coming up on Hotel Actual's position, but it's a mess down there. What in the world happened here?** 

**C - Dog Pound. Do you see any survivors?** 

**DP - Negative. There seems to be no movement here..  Wait. I see somebody. He's dressed in black. Is that a civi?** 

**H21 - WAIT! Careful, Dog Pound. That is not…** 

**DP - He's running towards us, he might be armed... Is he gonna jump? OH JESUS CHRIST…**

We heard a bang from the helicopter as something too fast for the naked eye to catch slammed through it and then smoke started coming out of it in pulsating waves as it began spinning out of control. 

**DP - MAYDAY MAYDAY. THIS IS DOG POUND 2-5, WE ARE GOING DOWN IN GRID 231-** 

The helicopter slammed into the ground with a resounding crash and almost immediately burst into flames that flashed so bright in the greyish background they made me blink my eyes. 

**C - Hotel 2-1. What's happening down there?** 

**H21- Sir, it looks like something smashed into Dog Pound.** 

**C - Roger. Secure the crash site. Evac is inbound.** 

**C - Hotel 2-1. Come in.** 

The Sniper team didn't reply, probably because they saw what we were looking at right now. The thing that had murdered the others was now stalking them. 

**H21 - COMMAND, IT SAW US. LEMANSKI, PACK YOUR SHIT. WE'RE LEAVING NOW. TELL EVAC TO DOUBLE TIME IT.** 

**C - Slow down, son. Who saw you?** 

**H21 - IT'S COMING. SEND BACKUP NOW!** 

**C - Evac is inbound. But I need to know you're position... Hotel 2-1?** 

While command was speaking, that unholy shriek once again boomed in the vicinity of H21, and their camera fell over to the side, staring off into the distance uselessly. 

**C - Hotel 2-1, respond.** 

*

And with that the video finally ended. I tore my eyes off the screen and looked at Liam, my head buzzing with a thousand different questions, so I settled for the most obvious of responses. ""I need a fucking drink.""

He looked every bit as handsome as he did the last time I had seen him, with not even a single strand of his short wavy blonde hair out of place, quiet unlike my own follicularly challenged self. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Touche. Growing old&amp;#39;s a bitch, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot; He asked wistfully. I didn&amp;#39;t bother to reply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made small talk, catching up on what the two of us had been upto in the past decade as we strolled over to where he had parked his car, dancing around the topic we really needed to have a discussion on, with the two of us being far too professional to do that where someone could easily eavesdrop. As we cleared the many checkpoints surrounding the airport and went deep into the city, we settled into a companionable silence as the emaciated Barada river pathetically burbled along next to us. I rested my head on the cool window of the car and gazed at the nauseatingly familiar skyline of the city. All this sight was missing was plumes of thick, black smoke rising upwards in the distant horizon and it would have felt like I had travelled back in time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our journey eventually ended at a deceptively abandoned looking dilapidated school building situated in the outskirts of the city. As we drove through the rusted iron gates, kicking up dust in the process, I could feel eyes on me. My suspicions were confirmed when I spotted snipers on the roof. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You wanna tell me what the fuck the US military is doing this deep in regime territory?&amp;quot; I asked Liam who was looking at me in the rear view mirror. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, it&amp;#39;s all about why you&amp;#39;re here… No, why &lt;em&gt;we&amp;#39;re&lt;/em&gt; here.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, why exactly are we here?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sighed, taking one hand off the wheel and rubbing his eyes. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s bad, Murtaza... Really bad.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As bad as the last time?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He snorted. &amp;quot;Worse, much worse. Last time was nothing compared to this. This thing&amp;#39;s got everybody spooked. I&amp;#39;ve been getting calls from people I should never be getting calls from. I hauled ass and arrived here as soon as I could.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What in the fuck happened?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A couple of weeks ago, the US military carried out a raid against a high ranking Tahrir al-Sham commander in the north... It didn&amp;#39;t work out quite like they thought it would, in fact it was a damn mess. Everybody died.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raised my eyebrow. &amp;quot;And I&amp;#39;m guessing it wasn&amp;#39;t just an ambush by the terrorists.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head. &amp;quot;No, it certainly wasn&amp;#39;t. We wouldn&amp;#39;t be here if it was, now would we? No... They got it all on camera, man. Shit&amp;#39;s really fucked. Never seen anything like it in my life.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was quite a statement, considering the kind of shit we come across in our line of work. We piled out of the car and walked into the school, which served as a makeshift military base, populated by what seemed to be essential personnel only, to keep it all under wraps, I presume. Liam introduced us to the officer in command, and together we strode into what used to be the staff room of the school, now with monitors lining the walls from the floor to the ceiling. The officer gave us files containing a radio transcript of the operation and instructed one of his men to fire up some of the monitors and show us the video. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began with the strike team sliding down the ropes of the helicopter which sent sand spiralling up into the air with its powerful rotating blades. Judging by the greyish hue of the video, I deduced it was a nighttime operation, and we were looking through cameras mounted on the helmets of the soldiers. The radio crackled and they began communicating, and I had to look at the file once again to check the call signs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HA - Hotel Actual. (The strike team). 
H21 - Sniper spotter team. 
DP - Dog pound. (Transport helicopter).
C - Command. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - Command, Hotel Actual. Come in, over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soldiers had descended and were spread out into a lose circle. They were in a rural area, and I could barely make out some old and beaten down structures in the background. The guy whose camera we were following must have been the team leader, since he was the one communicating, with his thumb on the radio on his shoulder. We heard a disembodied voice blaring from the radio as command replied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Hotel Actual, Command. Receiving, over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - We&amp;#39;re coming up on the compound now. We&amp;#39;ll locate and neutralise the target while Hotel 2-1 provides overwatch. How copy, over?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the soldiers broke away from the group and disappeared into the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Affirmative. Make sure you get a PID on the target before you engage. We&amp;#39;re trying to avoid civilian casualties here.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - Roger that. Over and out.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their weapons drawn, the team moved as a unit towards its target, which became clearer the closer they got to it. It was a two storied building with paint peeling off the walls, some of which were crumbling so badly that I could make out the house&amp;#39;s brick and cement skeletal structure underneath. The team assembled behind the boundary wall, and I saw one of the soldier&amp;#39;s eyes glow under the glare from the camera as the team leader looked at him. The radio sputtered again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - Hotel Actual, Hotel 2-1. We are in position overlooking the compound, over.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - Hotel 2-1, Hotel Actual, copy. Maintain eyes on target, and identify and neutralise any hostiles. Be advised, civilians are still in the area, so get a PID before engaging, over.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - Roger, Hotel Actual. Over and out.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team leader craned his neck and the helicopter appeared as a small figure in the screen, hovering in the grey sky some distance away from the strike team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Looks like Dog Pound&amp;#39;s covering our asses. Alright boys, let&amp;#39;s get this shit done and go back to our warm ass beds.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; He barked some orders and the soldiers began storming the house. They swung the gate open, and entered the yard, fanning out to cover all possible entrances. The team leader had reached the front door when his radio interrupted him once again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Hotel Actual. I&amp;#39;m seeing movement to your southwest, over.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - What was that, Dog Pound? Are we cleared to advance?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Negative. Hold position. Over.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Hotel 2-1. Do you have eyes on?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - Affirmative. Hotel Actual, you have an unidentified individual about a 100 metres to the southwest, unarmed. Proceed with caution.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Take us to the sniper team, please.&amp;quot; Liam requested the man working on the computer who changed the view on the screen with a couple of rapid clicks. The scene shifted, and we were now on top of the roof of a nearby building, looking down at Hotel Actual from the back. &amp;quot;There.&amp;quot; Liam said, pointing at the right bottom corner of the screen. &amp;quot;Do you see it?&amp;quot; I nodded, I could faintly make out an unusually tall figure stalking the strike team. The sniper repositioned his gun, and the figure became slightly clearer, but not much. &amp;quot;Alright.&amp;quot; Liam continued, &amp;quot;take us back.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back to the team leader of Hotel Actual who quickly gave orders to his men using some hand signals and retraced his steps to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - Roger, Hotel 2-1. We see him.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hold!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The team leader shouted. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;US forces. Put your hands up.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The figure disregarded the command and continued to move closer. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Stop. Turn around and walk away. Or we will fire on you.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure moved in a little closer, and my heart jumped out of my mouth as I saw him for the first time. He was tall, much taller than what I had assumed him to be, clad in some black robe, probably a kaftan or a thawb, with a keffiyeh tied up like a turban on his head. His lips were stretched into an unnaturally wide and still smile, as if that expression was forever frozen on his face, an expression that oozed maliciousness. His skin was so pale that light seemed to bounce off him, like some fucked up miniature moon. But the most disturbing thing about him were his eyes, two giant glowing orbs that burnt like the sun. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The team leader swore, and he was joined by the other soldiers.  &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Do you see his eyes, Sergeant.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck is that?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t help but shiver at the sheer evil emanating from this thing. The team leader was faster at getting over the shock of it all than I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - Command, be advised. There is a… civilian near our position.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Hotel Actual, are you positive he&amp;#39;s not armed?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the team leader could reply, the man with the glowing eyes just disappeared with a loud pop, and the screen shook wildly as the soldiers began to panic. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Where did he go?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An anguish filled scream ripped through the soldiers, making the team leader swing his head in the direction of the sound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Hotel Actual, come in.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the camera stabilised we saw that the man with the glowing eyes had stabbed one of the soldiers through the chest with his bare hand and was now dangling the poor bastard in the air like a rag doll. He pulled his hand free, and turned his head sharply to look at the team leader, his smile somehow stretching even wider. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sh.. Shoot it!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The Sergeant shouted, pulling his gun up, but his finger froze with fear when the man opened his mouth, his jaw dropping low enough to touch his chest, and screeched, with the sound so low and animalistic it made those of us watching the video wince. Muzzle flashes lit up the screen as the soldiers fired at the man but he disappeared almost instantly, causing the bullets to sail through the air harmlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Command, this Dog Pound 2-5, we&amp;#39;re observing small arms fire going off in Hotel Actual&amp;#39;s position. I repeat, shots fired.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - How many combatants are engaging them, Dog Pound?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Do you copy that, Hotel 2-1? Can you identify the number of combatants engaging Hotel Actual, over?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - Dog Pound. It&amp;#39;s… a blur. I can&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strike team was being picked off one by one, with the attacker being too fast for the frightened soldiers to handle. That, &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, wasn&amp;#39;t content with just killing them. He was taunting them, taking his time to extend their suffering, and mocking them. At one point he ripped off the arms of one of the soldiers and used them to wave at the team leader. Sickening stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HA - THIS IS HOTEL ACTUAL. SOMETHING IS TEARING APART OUR MEN. FUCK. SHOOT IT. REQUESTING BACKUP IMMEDIATELY.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next second, the man with the glowing eyes appeared right in front of the team leader, his face just inches from the camera. I could almost feel the rot and decay in his skin, even as the glow from his eyes consumed half the screen. Then the team leader&amp;#39;s head jerked to the side with a horrible crunch and he fell over backwards, the camera hitting the ground lens first, taking away all visibility. Liam whispered something, and the view subsequently changed to the sniper team&amp;#39;s position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - Hotel Actual, come in. Steve! Rodriguez!... Dog Pound, Hotel Actual is in heavy combat and requires backup, can you fly in and assist, over?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Roger. We&amp;#39;re flying in now. Keep providing overwatch and look out for RPGs.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - Affirmative. But be advised, Hotel Actual&amp;#39;s position has gone completely dark. We see no movement, whatsoever.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming sound of the helicopter took over as Dog Pound approached the scene of the carnage.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;Does Dog Pound not have a camera?&amp;quot; I asked softly. &amp;quot;It did.&amp;quot; Liam replied solemnly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Hotel 2-1, we&amp;#39;re coming up on Hotel Actual&amp;#39;s position, but it&amp;#39;s a mess down there. What in the world happened here?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Dog Pound. Do you see any survivors?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - Negative. There seems to be no movement here..  Wait. I see somebody. He&amp;#39;s dressed in black. Is that a civi?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - WAIT! Careful, Dog Pound. That is not…&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - He&amp;#39;s running towards us, he might be armed... Is he gonna jump? OH JESUS CHRIST…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We heard a bang from the helicopter as something too fast for the naked eye to catch slammed through it and then smoke started coming out of it in pulsating waves as it began spinning out of control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DP - MAYDAY MAYDAY. THIS IS DOG POUND 2-5, WE ARE GOING DOWN IN GRID 231-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The helicopter slammed into the ground with a resounding crash and almost immediately burst into flames that flashed so bright in the greyish background they made me blink my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Hotel 2-1. What&amp;#39;s happening down there?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21- Sir, it looks like something smashed into Dog Pound.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Roger. Secure the crash site. Evac is inbound.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Hotel 2-1. Come in.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sniper team didn&amp;#39;t reply, probably because they saw what we were looking at right now. The thing that had murdered the others was now stalking them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - COMMAND, IT SAW US. LEMANSKI, PACK YOUR SHIT. WE&amp;#39;RE LEAVING NOW. TELL EVAC TO DOUBLE TIME IT.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Slow down, son. Who saw you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H21 - IT&amp;#39;S COMING. SEND BACKUP NOW!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Evac is inbound. But I need to know you&amp;#39;re position... Hotel 2-1?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While command was speaking, that unholy shriek once again boomed in the vicinity of H21, and their camera fell over to the side, staring off into the distance uselessly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C - Hotel 2-1, respond.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that the video finally ended. I tore my eyes off the screen and looked at Liam, my head buzzing with a thousand different questions, so I settled for the most obvious of responses. &amp;quot;I need a fucking drink.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

Isn’t it incredible how nature tends to sense an incoming threat? 

The insects quiet their songs; the small mammals stop dead in their tracks; hell, even the wind itself seems to come to a complete standstill. The inherent silence perpetuated by nature is enough to send chills up my spine, even to this day. 

I clearly recall the deadly quiet; with Sean and Shelton’s footfalls and screams being the only sounds that exploded in the forest that day. 

After that horrifying screech, they rounded the corner like bats out of hell. The absolute terror in their eyes along with the absence of nature’s chatter told me the certainty of the incoming threat.

What I heard next confirmed the shouts coming from the Brigade’s officers. 

Directly behind Sean and Shelton came a thunderous crashing through the forest. It sounded as if a bulldozer was flattening everything in its path- coming straight towards us. 

I turned to Douglas and nodded as we both changed forms. As they reached our location at the scene, Shelton took his place beside us in his form; while Sean stood at the ready behind us, teeth glaring in the moonlight. 

We stood completely still, an eerie silence overtaking our senses as the monster paused just outside our line of sight. The smell hit me like a train, and I almost wretched from the scent of death and decay. 

This beast took a step or two towards us and I flinched as I saw it: long, tall antlers rose out of the brush directly behind the tree line. I knew it was toying with us; almost as if it was giving us time to begin to panic. 

We stood completely still. I noticed that the sounds around us seemed to follow trait; the only thing I could hear was the blood pumping through my heart, becoming almost deafening. 

I slowly turned my head towards Douglas, fear apparent on his cat-like face. Just as he turned to mouth a quick “what the fuck” in my direction, we again heard the screech we had heard earlier. This time though, it was terrifyingly close and I could feel the ground beneath me vibrate. 

I don’t think I was mentally prepared for the shit show that finally appeared from behind that tree line. 

The fucker stood at least 10 feet tall; not including the bloody antlers that rose off it’s skull. Bits of flesh and matted fur hung from its rib cage, and it’s skull was stained a bright crimson color. 

The most disturbing trait, though, were it’s arms. Long, skinny arms dangled at its side; accompanied by knife-like claws, that easily stretched two feet in length. 

Horrified, I held up my paw in a clenched position, letting Douglas know to hold steady. The Wendigo watched my every movement; it’s jaw hanging open and releasing harsh, raspy breaths. We stood there staring at its glowing red eyes for what seemed like an eternity, waiting for the next movement. 

What happened next had me almost paralyzed from fear. 

From directly behind us, I heard something huge approaching on all fours. It was running full speed, and it was fast. My senses were so overwhelmed by the sickly smell of the beast in front of us, that I could not make out what creature was coming straight in our direction. 

I slowly turned my head in horror to face the incoming visitor, not knowing what to expect to burst through the forest behind us. 

In a flash, the creature tore through the trees behind us and sped past the four of us, stopping in front of me facing the terror at the tree line. 

I felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over my body as I recognized the werebear standing tall ahead of me. 

“Boys didn’t tell me y’all were going after a fucking Wendigo?” Randy snorted, his face keeping contact with the monstrosity ahead. 

I assume this new addition to our group really pissed the fucker off, because before I knew it, it released another otherworldly scream and tore through the trees directly at Randy. 

We all began sprinting at the creature, adrenaline pumping and hearts racing. Just as we reached Randy’s position, I noticed a familiar silver glint flash before our eyes. 

Randy slammed the silver blade into the eye socket of the beast just as it reached him. He twisted the blade as the giant stopped in it’s tracks and screeched in agony, swiping it’s claws desperately at its face. 

Randy took this opportunity to turn to us and snarl, “RUN, ASSHOLES!”

That’s all the reassurance we needed, because we all turned and high-tailed it out of that damned forest. As we ran, tearing down branches and brush ahead of us, we continued to hear the roars of pain released by the creature. 

The unholy screeches only silenced as we reached the vehicles we had parked in front of the old shack earlier. All in unison, we stopped to change forms and struggled to catch our breath. 

I met Douglas’s gaze as he slumped to the ground, his face contorted in terror. 

“Ryan what the actual fuck-“ 

He clamped his jaw shut as I saw the silver refract in the moonlight, as the blade wizzed past my head, embedding itself in a tree behind me. 

That big son-of-a-bitch had slung the blade through the trees, at my head. 

That action was all the motivation we needed as we grouped into our vehicles and got ready to haul ass out of there. Before he got into his old truck, Randy pulled the dagger out of the tree trunk and waved it at me through my Jeep window. 

I saw his mouth moving as he mumbled a slew of curses before hopping into his truck. I slammed the gas as Douglas closed the door, and tore off the dirt path we had come in on.

My cell rang loudly, making both Douglas and I both jump in our seats. It was Randy.

“Looks like we need a group therapy meeting!” Randy yelled out as I swiped my phone to answer the call. “Call your fuckin’ buddies, and you bunch of dumbasses meet me at your grandfathers place in 20 minutes!” He barked, as the phone line went quiet. 

I looked over at Douglas, a sense of relief on his face. 

“I think we fucked up” I said, a bit of a nervous chuckle in my voice. 

He shook his head with a grin appearing across his face. “No shit, man.” He looked over at me as I drove like a hellion down the main road. “What the actual SHIT was that?” He looked back to the road in front of us. 

“I believe we bit off a little more than we could chew,” I huffed as I called Sean and Shelton, informing them of the upcoming meeting at Pop’s house. 

Douglas and I drove on, nervously talking about the situation we were now in. “Why was Randy so pissed off?” Douglas asked,  a confused look on his face. 

“I guess we are going to find out here shortly,” I added with a smirk as we pulled up the path towards my grandfather’s cabin. 

Randy was already there, standing on the porch with my Pop. They both wore a worried look, as they watched us pull up. The boys from the Brigade screeched up behind us, terror still etched into their faces, as they got out of their vehicle and headed towards the porch. 

Something was wrong, and I knew it. The looks on my pop’s and Randy’s face told me that there was new information, and we were about to get a full-blown bitch session. 

As we all made our way to the porch, my grandfather stood in the doorway with an absent-minded gaze on his face. Randy stood in front of him, arms crossed and eyes glaring. 

There was something else off, though. Someone, or something, else stood behind my grandfather, shrouded in the darkness of the cabin. 

He stepped out onto the porch, wearing a two-piece suit and dark sunglasses. The guy looked official, but also strangely familiar. 

I noticed Sean and Shelton both drop their heads as the figure appeared, telling me they knew exactly who was standing before us. 

The man stretched out his hand to me, a glimmer of white flashing across his face as he smiled. His teeth were sharp and pointed at the ends, like tiny knives poking out of his gums. 

“Hello Ryan,” he said, his voice deep, slow and steady. “My name is Rustev. These boys here,” he nodded towards Sean and Shelton, “almost got you all killed.” 

I stopped and turned to the two behind us, their heads still dropped and hands held behind their backs. 

I looked back to the strange man and cocked my head to the side. “What in the hell are you talking about?” I choked out, a blaring anger rising in my chest. 

Randy stepped in front of the man in black and stared intently into my eyes, and then sternly glared at the officers behind us. 

“Fellas, It’s about time we had ourselves that little group therapy session now!” I could sense the aggressive tinge to Randy’s voice.

The red glint seeping into Randy’s irises told me that there was much, much more to this situation than what we had originally bargained for. 

My mind racing a million miles a minute, we carefully followed the man in the suit and Randy into the cabin. Douglas elbowed me and widened his eyes, as if to ask what the hell was happening. I shrugged and we entered into my Pop’s living room. 

Shock ran across my face as I stepped into the room. 

Papers were strewn everywhere, missing persons posters were scattered across the table. 

The one thing that particularly stood out to me was a small, ornate chest in the middle of the table. I walked over to it and placed my hand on the top, carefully lifting the lid. Inside were some crumpled notes, and a broken piece of bone lay on top. 

Only then I realized that it was not bone, but a piece of a long, sharp claw. 

I gasped loudly as I read the label pinned to the claw, my breathing almost coming to a complete halt. 

‘ALPHA WENDIGO, WEETIVA” was written in red ink on the label. 

Underneath it in smaller print is the sentence that made me cringe in absolute dread.

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it incredible how nature tends to sense an incoming threat? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insects quiet their songs; the small mammals stop dead in their tracks; hell, even the wind itself seems to come to a complete standstill. The inherent silence perpetuated by nature is enough to send chills up my spine, even to this day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clearly recall the deadly quiet; with Sean and Shelton’s footfalls and screams being the only sounds that exploded in the forest that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that horrifying screech, they rounded the corner like bats out of hell. The absolute terror in their eyes along with the absence of nature’s chatter told me the certainty of the incoming threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I heard next confirmed the shouts coming from the Brigade’s officers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directly behind Sean and Shelton came a thunderous crashing through the forest. It sounded as if a bulldozer was flattening everything in its path- coming straight towards us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned to Douglas and nodded as we both changed forms. As they reached our location at the scene, Shelton took his place beside us in his form; while Sean stood at the ready behind us, teeth glaring in the moonlight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stood completely still, an eerie silence overtaking our senses as the monster paused just outside our line of sight. The smell hit me like a train, and I almost wretched from the scent of death and decay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beast took a step or two towards us and I flinched as I saw it: long, tall antlers rose out of the brush directly behind the tree line. I knew it was toying with us; almost as if it was giving us time to begin to panic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stood completely still. I noticed that the sounds around us seemed to follow trait; the only thing I could hear was the blood pumping through my heart, becoming almost deafening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slowly turned my head towards Douglas, fear apparent on his cat-like face. Just as he turned to mouth a quick “what the fuck” in my direction, we again heard the screech we had heard earlier. This time though, it was terrifyingly close and I could feel the ground beneath me vibrate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I was mentally prepared for the shit show that finally appeared from behind that tree line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fucker stood at least 10 feet tall; not including the bloody antlers that rose off it’s skull. Bits of flesh and matted fur hung from its rib cage, and it’s skull was stained a bright crimson color. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most disturbing trait, though, were it’s arms. Long, skinny arms dangled at its side; accompanied by knife-like claws, that easily stretched two feet in length. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horrified, I held up my paw in a clenched position, letting Douglas know to hold steady. The Wendigo watched my every movement; it’s jaw hanging open and releasing harsh, raspy breaths. We stood there staring at its glowing red eyes for what seemed like an eternity, waiting for the next movement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened next had me almost paralyzed from fear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From directly behind us, I heard something huge approaching on all fours. It was running full speed, and it was fast. My senses were so overwhelmed by the sickly smell of the beast in front of us, that I could not make out what creature was coming straight in our direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slowly turned my head in horror to face the incoming visitor, not knowing what to expect to burst through the forest behind us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a flash, the creature tore through the trees behind us and sped past the four of us, stopping in front of me facing the terror at the tree line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over my body as I recognized the werebear standing tall ahead of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boys didn’t tell me y’all were going after a fucking Wendigo?” Randy snorted, his face keeping contact with the monstrosity ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume this new addition to our group really pissed the fucker off, because before I knew it, it released another otherworldly scream and tore through the trees directly at Randy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all began sprinting at the creature, adrenaline pumping and hearts racing. Just as we reached Randy’s position, I noticed a familiar silver glint flash before our eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randy slammed the silver blade into the eye socket of the beast just as it reached him. He twisted the blade as the giant stopped in it’s tracks and screeched in agony, swiping it’s claws desperately at its face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randy took this opportunity to turn to us and snarl, “RUN, ASSHOLES!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all the reassurance we needed, because we all turned and high-tailed it out of that damned forest. As we ran, tearing down branches and brush ahead of us, we continued to hear the roars of pain released by the creature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unholy screeches only silenced as we reached the vehicles we had parked in front of the old shack earlier. All in unison, we stopped to change forms and struggled to catch our breath. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Douglas’s gaze as he slumped to the ground, his face contorted in terror. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ryan what the actual fuck-“ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clamped his jaw shut as I saw the silver refract in the moonlight, as the blade wizzed past my head, embedding itself in a tree behind me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That big son-of-a-bitch had slung the blade through the trees, at my head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That action was all the motivation we needed as we grouped into our vehicles and got ready to haul ass out of there. Before he got into his old truck, Randy pulled the dagger out of the tree trunk and waved it at me through my Jeep window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw his mouth moving as he mumbled a slew of curses before hopping into his truck. I slammed the gas as Douglas closed the door, and tore off the dirt path we had come in on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cell rang loudly, making both Douglas and I both jump in our seats. It was Randy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Looks like we need a group therapy meeting!” Randy yelled out as I swiped my phone to answer the call. “Call your fuckin’ buddies, and you bunch of dumbasses meet me at your grandfathers place in 20 minutes!” He barked, as the phone line went quiet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked over at Douglas, a sense of relief on his face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we fucked up” I said, a bit of a nervous chuckle in my voice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head with a grin appearing across his face. “No shit, man.” He looked over at me as I drove like a hellion down the main road. “What the actual SHIT was that?” He looked back to the road in front of us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe we bit off a little more than we could chew,” I huffed as I called Sean and Shelton, informing them of the upcoming meeting at Pop’s house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas and I drove on, nervously talking about the situation we were now in. “Why was Randy so pissed off?” Douglas asked,  a confused look on his face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I guess we are going to find out here shortly,” I added with a smirk as we pulled up the path towards my grandfather’s cabin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randy was already there, standing on the porch with my Pop. They both wore a worried look, as they watched us pull up. The boys from the Brigade screeched up behind us, terror still etched into their faces, as they got out of their vehicle and headed towards the porch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something was wrong, and I knew it. The looks on my pop’s and Randy’s face told me that there was new information, and we were about to get a full-blown bitch session. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all made our way to the porch, my grandfather stood in the doorway with an absent-minded gaze on his face. Randy stood in front of him, arms crossed and eyes glaring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something else off, though. Someone, or something, else stood behind my grandfather, shrouded in the darkness of the cabin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stepped out onto the porch, wearing a two-piece suit and dark sunglasses. The guy looked official, but also strangely familiar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed Sean and Shelton both drop their heads as the figure appeared, telling me they knew exactly who was standing before us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man stretched out his hand to me, a glimmer of white flashing across his face as he smiled. His teeth were sharp and pointed at the ends, like tiny knives poking out of his gums. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello Ryan,” he said, his voice deep, slow and steady. “My name is Rustev. These boys here,” he nodded towards Sean and Shelton, “almost got you all killed.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped and turned to the two behind us, their heads still dropped and hands held behind their backs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked back to the strange man and cocked my head to the side. “What in the hell are you talking about?” I choked out, a blaring anger rising in my chest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randy stepped in front of the man in black and stared intently into my eyes, and then sternly glared at the officers behind us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fellas, It’s about time we had ourselves that little group therapy session now!” I could sense the aggressive tinge to Randy’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red glint seeping into Randy’s irises told me that there was much, much more to this situation than what we had originally bargained for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind racing a million miles a minute, we carefully followed the man in the suit and Randy into the cabin. Douglas elbowed me and widened his eyes, as if to ask what the hell was happening. I shrugged and we entered into my Pop’s living room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shock ran across my face as I stepped into the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Papers were strewn everywhere, missing persons posters were scattered across the table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that particularly stood out to me was a small, ornate chest in the middle of the table. I walked over to it and placed my hand on the top, carefully lifting the lid. Inside were some crumpled notes, and a broken piece of bone lay on top. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only then I realized that it was not bone, but a piece of a long, sharp claw. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gasped loudly as I read the label pinned to the claw, my breathing almost coming to a complete halt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘ALPHA WENDIGO, WEETIVA” was written in red ink on the label. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath it in smaller print is the sentence that made me cringe in absolute dread. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Status: active. Immortal. DO NOT engage under ANY circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep," 

The world was going to end in one day. In one day, it was the summer solstice. The final solstice of the year, according to ancient prophecies. As you could expect, the crime rate went up and the people of the world were distraught. As for me, not so much. I expected this. I saw ahead and planned. I was ready. 

On days like these, I would walk along the street. An evening stroll before 12 am, the supposed due date of the end. Some were looting the stores along the road, the police didn’t care due to the fact there would be no way to try the criminals. Owners didn’t care for the same reason. Everything would be gone anyways, what would it matter?

Aside from the few people looting the stores, granted nobody else had reason to care either, the streets were completely deserted. Empty.

I liked it. The emptiness of it all. You could taste the hopelessness in the air. In a way, it was comforting. It was comforting to know the end would take care of all of your problems, you wouldn’t have to worry about anything anymore. No more money issues, no worrying about food, or social problems. Nothing. I guess that was the comfort most people found in knowing you were going to die in a few hours. 

I sighed and sat on a bench that overlooked the large expanse of the river. The sun had set. It was dark already. I pulled out my phone to check the time, 11:57 pm it read. Three minutes. Three minutes till the end. 

A small smile appeared on my face as I looked up at the stars and the sky slowly began to grow brighter. A large fireball appeared in the night sky. It lit up the night as if it was the sun. And I felt the heat. I felt the fire lick at the air, churning it into a hot burning oven. My smile grew wider as my skin began to burn. 

I knew I was pushing it too far, but the pain edged me on. Finally, I closed my fist as fire started raining down on top of me and it all stopped.

Then it started again, but the rain of fire was going backwards, going back to the large ball of fire. My nails dug into my palm as it sped up, and the sky was dark again, and then sun began to rise from where it had set in the west. It traveled along the sky. People appeared, walking backwards and crying, breaking down in the middle of the grass before getting back up and walking once more. And then it began to grow dim as time moved faster backwards, the sun was setting in the east, before it had risen. It was pitch black once more, and the stars lit up the night sky. The moon hung in the middle of the darkness. I let go of my fist, my nails having punctured the skin on my palm, blood beading out. Everything stopped.

,nosleep,"Scrolling casually through Facebook one day, I found a part time babysitting job advert that needed a person to take care of a 5 y/o male child from 6 to 10 p.m. At that time, I was desperately looking for a part-time job to clear all off my student loans as they were getting me troubled every now and then. I had my college hours before that time and I knew that this was the perfect job that would get me easy money. 

I texted the person who had put it up and the reply came rather too quickly than expected.
It was a woman in her late 30s or so, and she didn't say much but just that the job starts at 6:00 tomorrow and told me to arrive at the specified address. Also, she said that I was going to be payed over $500 a night which made me question my decision. 'Was it a scam?' I said to myself, but also quickly presumed that they were rich as was my desperation .

When I reached the venue the next day, the door was opened by whom I had expected, the woman I had texted yesterday. She was well dressed and seemed like she was going to work. _Obviously_, I thought. 

I pulled out my ID but the woman just glanced at it casually and said 'I trust you,' in a low tone, 'But he'll be sleeping right now, don't wake him up.' she completed. She also handed the keys of the house and a paper chit to me, and started walking towards her car to leave. 
'Can I make some coffee?' I cried out from behind, waving the sachet I had brought with me. She didn't turn around but nodded her head, went inside, and drove away. _Okay._ 
I didn't waste time getting in the house because of the cold outside and the fact that there was a whole new house for me to explore, I knew it couldn't be a bad experience.

I went in, kept the keys and the chit on the shoe rack and sat down on the couch as I knew it was gonna be more boring than I had convinced myself for. 
I took out my phone and started my daily regimen, that is scrolling through r/nosleep. The stories seldom scared me anymore. So, at around 7 p.m. the boredom started getting the better of me.
I got up went into the kitchen and saw a mug that was probably kept for me as it seemed clean and was the only one on the kitchen rack. There were also plenty of utensils that I could use to warm up the water as I had also brought a packet of powdered milk with me. 

I had just started boiling the water, when I started hearing strange yawns from the room across the living room. The house was two storied and I presumed that it was the child whom I had heard.
I ignored it and resumed making my coffee, and when it was done I went to check on the child. 
I switched on the lights of the room but inside, found no one. 
I felt weird as my ears rarely deceived me. But I didn't pay much attention and went back, sat back on the couch and on the way, also picked up the chit that the woman had given me. The writing in the chit was neatly divided into pointers and not paragraphs, so it looked like it wasn't a message but a set of instructions. This is what it said:

_**Dear Ethan, thank you for applying for this job.**_ _Rather formal_, I thought.

_**Please follow what is written in this paper for a pleasant experience. You won't have to do much if you follow as written**_

_**1. If you hear a voice from the room across the living room, do not enter it. Just wait till the sound stops. If you try to enter the room and see someone, we'll take no responsibility thereafter.**_

_**2. If you had food, then do not go back to keep the utensils into the kitchen. Leave it for us.**_ 

_**3. Do not walk into the kitchen after 8:15 even if you hear something break or fall.**_

_**4. If the child stares at you from above the stairs and tells you to sing him to sleep, go with him and immediately leave the room after he is asleep.**_ 

_**5. Do not wake up the child after 8:00 p.m. and if you hear voices coming from upstairs, stay put in the living room.**_

_**6. Do not ask the child his name, and if you did,  do not call him by whatever name he told you.**_

_**7. From 6-7 p.m. he'll wait for you to get comfortable. But don't let your guard down.**_

I was shocked. I stared at it for a few minutes till I could digest whatever was written in it. I knew these rules were simple to follow but they also let out a creepy vibe. What was this, a cliché horror movie? 
It was also unnerving that they referred to their son as 'the child', it seemed as if these words were completely devoid of any empathy. What the hell was this 'do not call the child by his name' bullshit even?!

I put my cup down and thought that if I pass the test of time in the living room, there shouldn't be any problems, but suddenly a child's voice interrupted. 'Hello are you... the babysitter?'
I kept staring at the dim figure upstairs. 

'I am trying to sleep but I can't, could you just sing me a song?' he said in his soft voice. My eyes finally adjusted to see his face in the dark.
The little kid looked like the sweetest thing ever and I couldn't resist myself from asking, 'What's your name?' but suddenly realised that it it was told not to say this.
 'Jimmy,' he replied.
I didn't know what to do after that. On one mind I had that it was a prank but on the other the nosleep stories had made me question every life decision I had ever made. But still his innocent face drew me as I followed him up the stairs and into his room.

**7:45**
The bedside clock told me.

Jimmy lay down on his bed and picked up a paper. 'Please sing me this song, it's written by mama.'
I took the paper and told him that I didn't know how to sing but he was still adamant.

No choice, I decided and started singing. 

_**Monsters running everywhere 
Little kids may stay with me here
Where is the monster? Where is he? 
Little Jimmy wants to know who's there.**_
_What was with those lyrics?_

Clink! All the lights in the house went out together and there was silence. 'J... Jimmy?' I called. No response. I could almost shit my pants by this time but if that wasn't enough I felt a cold and strong grip on my arm.
I screamed out in fear and didn't shut up until the lights turned back as quickly as they had went out. I finally managed myself to look up and around the room.

Little Jimmy was in his bed and it was his arm gripping me. 

_**Immediately leave the room after he is asleep**_

I didn't want to take any excuses from myself after this and started to walk fast towards the door. But that 5-year old's grip was stronger than me. I pulled slowly but couldn't get his arm off. 'Jimmy leave me!' I screamed and pulled as hard as I could. He didn't move an inch. 

I almost would've cried at this point but what made me fear the most was that it was now 8:00 p.m. and I was still in his room. 

_**Do not wake up the child at 8:00 p.m. and if you hear voices coming from upstairs, stay put in the living room**_

He opened his eyes and to my horror, they weren't like any human. They somewhat would've resembled a cat's eyes. 'You forgot to wish me sweet dreams,' he said grinning, and released me. I didn't wait a second more, ran out and down the stairs, holding my breath. 
I thanked the Holy Spirit to have saved me from that nightmarish bedroom, and as soon as I reached my head hit the couch. I was shit scared to the point that I didn't want to look back up anymore. 

When I gained composure after 10-15 minutes or so, I was back up on my feet. 'I won't let my $500 go waste, kid,' I thought. I walked around the room thinking of what to do next, when I heard the sound of running water. 
If I carefully followed the sound, I knew it was coming from the kitchen. 

*I knew it! Some other person was also in this house, whom I had heard in the adjacent room. They were gonna have to face the shit they'd put me through today!*

I walked towards the kitchen with confident steps and found a woman washing the utensils with her back faced towards me. 
'Uhhhm... Excuse me,' I said but it seemed liked she didn't care. 

'Uh your kid, he...' I dropped my words after I noticed the utensils, all dripping with blood. She was washing utensils with blood! Shit shit shit, why's this going all wrong! 

_**Do not walk into the kitchen after 8:15**_

She closed the tap and I'd say she faced me, but actually only her head did. 

I knew I was gonna go nuts and didn't scream this time. I couldn't face a demon woman after a demon kid. I ran towards the shoe rack and grabbed the keys, all the time hearing slow approaching footsteps.

I ran out of that hellish place that night, but didn't dare to enter the bedroom or kitchen of my apartment. I didn't care about dinner. I just buried my face on my couch but, couldn't sleep a blink until morning. It's been about a month, and writing this was a tough decision, but I finally did. 

I did receive a message the next morning though:

**Hey, thanks for taking care of my child. He told me that you have a beautiful voice. Will eagerly wait for your shift today.**

Oh hell no. 
I blocked her account and deleted mine as well. 
I still don't know who that woman in the kitchen was, and quite literally, I'm not dying to find out. I've vowed to never return to that place again.",t2_5wdkix3g,False,,0,False,I wasn't hired for babysitting a human,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgm3tm,False,dark,,public,28,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,28,,False,,1583879585.0,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583906940.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrolling casually through Facebook one day, I found a part time babysitting job advert that needed a person to take care of a 5 y/o male child from 6 to 10 p.m. At that time, I was desperately looking for a part-time job to clear all off my student loans as they were getting me troubled every now and then. I had my college hours before that time and I knew that this was the perfect job that would get me easy money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I texted the person who had put it up and the reply came rather too quickly than expected.
It was a woman in her late 30s or so, and she didn&amp;#39;t say much but just that the job starts at 6:00 tomorrow and told me to arrive at the specified address. Also, she said that I was going to be payed over $500 a night which made me question my decision. &amp;#39;Was it a scam?&amp;#39; I said to myself, but also quickly presumed that they were rich as was my desperation .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I reached the venue the next day, the door was opened by whom I had expected, the woman I had texted yesterday. She was well dressed and seemed like she was going to work. &lt;em&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my ID but the woman just glanced at it casually and said &amp;#39;I trust you,&amp;#39; in a low tone, &amp;#39;But he&amp;#39;ll be sleeping right now, don&amp;#39;t wake him up.&amp;#39; she completed. She also handed the keys of the house and a paper chit to me, and started walking towards her car to leave. 
&amp;#39;Can I make some coffee?&amp;#39; I cried out from behind, waving the sachet I had brought with me. She didn&amp;#39;t turn around but nodded her head, went inside, and drove away. &lt;em&gt;Okay.&lt;/em&gt; 
I didn&amp;#39;t waste time getting in the house because of the cold outside and the fact that there was a whole new house for me to explore, I knew it couldn&amp;#39;t be a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went in, kept the keys and the chit on the shoe rack and sat down on the couch as I knew it was gonna be more boring than I had convinced myself for. 
I took out my phone and started my daily regimen, that is scrolling through &lt;a href=""/r/nosleep""&gt;r/nosleep&lt;/a&gt;. The stories seldom scared me anymore. So, at around 7 p.m. the boredom started getting the better of me.
I got up went into the kitchen and saw a mug that was probably kept for me as it seemed clean and was the only one on the kitchen rack. There were also plenty of utensils that I could use to warm up the water as I had also brought a packet of powdered milk with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just started boiling the water, when I started hearing strange yawns from the room across the living room. The house was two storied and I presumed that it was the child whom I had heard.
I ignored it and resumed making my coffee, and when it was done I went to check on the child. 
I switched on the lights of the room but inside, found no one. 
I felt weird as my ears rarely deceived me. But I didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention and went back, sat back on the couch and on the way, also picked up the chit that the woman had given me. The writing in the chit was neatly divided into pointers and not paragraphs, so it looked like it wasn&amp;#39;t a message but a set of instructions. This is what it said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Ethan, thank you for applying for this job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rather formal&lt;/em&gt;, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please follow what is written in this paper for a pleasant experience. You won&amp;#39;t have to do much if you follow as written&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. If you hear a voice from the room across the living room, do not enter it. Just wait till the sound stops. If you try to enter the room and see someone, we&amp;#39;ll take no responsibility thereafter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. If you had food, then do not go back to keep the utensils into the kitchen. Leave it for us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Do not walk into the kitchen after 8:15 even if you hear something break or fall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. If the child stares at you from above the stairs and tells you to sing him to sleep, go with him and immediately leave the room after he is asleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Do not wake up the child after 8:00 p.m. and if you hear voices coming from upstairs, stay put in the living room.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Do not ask the child his name, and if you did,  do not call him by whatever name he told you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. From 6-7 p.m. he&amp;#39;ll wait for you to get comfortable. But don&amp;#39;t let your guard down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked. I stared at it for a few minutes till I could digest whatever was written in it. I knew these rules were simple to follow but they also let out a creepy vibe. What was this, a cliché horror movie? 
It was also unnerving that they referred to their son as &amp;#39;the child&amp;#39;, it seemed as if these words were completely devoid of any empathy. What the hell was this &amp;#39;do not call the child by his name&amp;#39; bullshit even?!&lt;/p&gt;

Hello all, thank you for all the concerns. I think I am being watched right now, I feel like they are closing in on me. Before I tell you where I am, let me tell you about my second shift at the private cemetery. 


After my first night, I went home and slept for about 30 minutes. So many thoughts were racing through my head. I knew what I heard, there was no mistaking the laughing. While I vaguely believe in the paranormal, I know what I heard. I looked over the list a few more times when I was home, each time sounding more crazier then the last. I looked up the cemetery online and found little information about it, everything about this place sounded like a mystery. As the day winded down, I barely realized that I hadn't slept much since getting back from my first shift and I was 8 coffees deep, tonight was going to be a long night. I packed my backpack, brought some snacks and headed out. 


Like before, the narrow dirt path was empty as the sun began to settle behind the tree tops. Ravens cawed and flew overhead as I descended deeper into the woods towards the cemetery. I approached the familiar steel gate, ravens rested on top of the sharp studded spikes that lined the length of the rusty gate. While I pulled into the cemetery, I noticed it wasn't as quiet as the other night, no I was hearing something, sirens. I drove along the winding path, where my view of the hut was obscured by a dozen of police cars and ambulances. I froze panicking in my car, a cold sweat was running down my neck as I watched two paramedics wheel out a large black bag. Besides the hut, was the same car that was here yesterday, excepts its front window was caved in like someone threw a bowling ball through it, I only figured the red had to be blood. The paramedics wheeled out what appeared to be a body bag, my mind was racing while I tried to swallow the dry lump in my throat. I nearly jumped out of my skin when a nearby officer tapped his baton on my window. 


He motioned for me to roll down my windows, I didn't even realize my hands were shaking *""Sir if you do not work here i'm going to have to ask you to leave""* the officer sternly asked.


I shakily responded *""I...I do work here, what is going on?""* wiping my clay hands against my pant legs.


*""Sir there has been an accident here, tell me now, do you know this gentleman""* the officer handed me a picture of the morning security guard. He looked tired in the picture like he did the other night, again I thought he must not get enough sleep. My mind flashed back to the minutes of sleep I racked up in the previous two days. *""Yes I do, is that him over there""* pointing towards the body bag that was being wheeled into the ambulance*"" 


*""It is son, like I said there had been an accident, did you happen to have any ongoing contact with him, Robert I think his name was?""* the cop asked, leaning more into my car, his eyes scanning the back of my seats.


*""No, I...I barely spoke to him, yesterday was my first day on the job, he is supposed to relieve me of my shift in the morning while I do him for the evening""*. I shakily replied, my voice cracking a bit.


The cop fumbled in his pocket, his suit was pressed sharply and his muscles bulged from his arms *""Son, why don't you take my card, we may have some more questions for you in a bit. You said you relieve him of his shift in the evening, I'm assuming your here in front of me now about to do just that. While I can't say exactly what, I will suggest that you be careful tonight son, I ain't never seen anything like what happened to that boy in years""* 


If I wasn't already on the verge of shitting my pants, what he told me made me close. I put his card in my back pocket and rolled up my window. The officer pointed me along where I parked alongside Roberts car. The bowling ball shaped hole in the windshield pointed inwards, like something was thrown through it from the outside; the jagged remainders of glass were painted red. A tow truck lifted the car onto its bed, the ambulances began to drive off and soon I was alone along the hut. The last to leave was the officer I spoke to before, he stood along his driver side door, met my gaze and nodded slowly before getting in and driving off. Before I could collect my thoughts, my phone vibrated. Another text message came in which read an additional months of advance pay had been transferred into my bank account. Soon enough, I got an email to confirm just that. I started to think I was going crazy now, either from lack of sleep or fright. My mind started racing, could the Robert have died from not following the rules? What made the hole in his car? 


I reluctantly grabbed my bag and headed inside the hut. Before I could sit down, the HAM radio began going off, it was only a couple minutes after my shift started. *""Hello""* I answered, clearing my throat. 


*"" Glad to see you back, such a shame about Robert, he was with us for 3 years""* a woman answered. *""I'm sure you got the bank statement sent to you""* I nodded like she could see that. 


*""Good, well think of it as payment for seeing Robert go out like that, just keep quiet and more rewards will be sent you're way*"" the receiver clicked off. 


Great I thought, having to keep quiet just because I am getting paid off, I had to think about it. I had all night to wonder about Robert, as well as what I could do with the money now. While I rhymed over the endless possibilities of what to buy, I refreshed myself on the rules of the night which were neatly placed on the desk ready for me. 


1.Do not investigate any ringing bells, no matter how close they sound, they aren't
2.If bugs start landing on the huts glass window, burn the candles that are under the desk till your shifts end.
3.If pebbles are thrown at the huts glass, turn the light off and hide under the desk till the laughing stops.
4.If grave stones began to appear and reappear, go outside and pour oil over them, oil located under the desk.
5.If a gravedigger comes, do not approach him, let him come to the window, he will stare at you for a few hours but will leave after, DO NOT GO OUTSIDE WHILE HES HERE
6.Do not venture out past the great angel grave under any circumstance
7.Do not answer anyone talking from the HAM Radio except for the initial call when you came in.
8.Lock the hut after each time you step outside.
9.Do not leave for the bathroom for more than 10 minutes at time, if you have to, come back, wait, then go back.
10. If at any point you return to the hut, and see someone else sitting in the hut, get in your car and drive off.


Before long, a couple hours passed by, and I was starting to feel the effects of only limited sleep from before. I sucked down two RedBulls within those first few hours. Time seemed to stand still when the sun went down. The cemetery was swallowed by darkness and the world went quiet. Soon I was face to face with just the few graves I could see in front of me, I counted each to make sure I appeased rule number 4. While I struggled to stay awake, I was jolted up by the sound of the receiver from the radio going off. It hummed alive and struggled to catch a signal. I reactively went to grab it when I stopped myself short, number 7. I read the list again, sure enough, number 7, do not answer anyone talking from the HAM radio except for the initial cal when you came in. I held back and waited for the receiver to end. 


What seemed like an eternity, the receiver continued until a faint raspy voice began to speak from within the static. *""He...Hellloo....Helllo*"" The voice from the receiver called out. I sat nervously in front of the receiver, my watch read 10pm. *""Hellloooo""* drawn out the voice came in, more masculine each time. I tried to distract myself, I counted the graves, six, just like last time. Then, the receiver went out, the static stopped. I let out my breathe, which I didn't even realize I was holding. I looked out into the cemetery, zoning out  a bit when something caught my attention. Trying to focus on my faint reflection in the glass, itt looked like something was behind me. I froze up, feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I squinted harder, trying to focus on the black shape in the dull reflection. When I gathered enough courage, I swiftly turned around, bracing for the worst; nothing. Again, I let out a sigh of relief. 


The receiver shot to life with ear piercing static *""HELLO!""* the mans voice roared out. *""HELLO! HELLO! HELO!""*  each time the voice shrieked  higher in pitch. *""HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!""* sounding like a demented clown who sucked too much helium. My ears were ringing, I plugged them and shut my eyes tight, then silence. The receiver clicked off. I held tight for a few moments, before I opened, I was alone. I scooted back from the radio and rested my head on the desk, tears were bubbling in the corner of my eyes. Before I could wallow in fright, my bladder began to hurt when I realized I really needed to pee. 


This was something I was hoping I didn't have to do, but the 8 coffees all day and two quick RedBulls weren't doing me any favors. I reluctantly sat up, zippered my hoodie and braced myself to go outside. The port-a-potty was about 20 feet from the hut, right next to a massive oak tree with big spider web looking branches full of thick leaves. As I stepped outside the hut, rule 9 echoed in my head, 10 minutes I got, don't forget to lock the door. I locked the door behind me and sped walked to the port-a-potty. 


I reached it in seconds, slamming the plastic door behind me and frantically reached my zipper. Waiting to pee, I started hearing rustling outside. The port-a-potty was dark, not a light except for the moonlight peering through the hole on the corner roof. I started to pee, despite the rustling growing louder. 2 minutes since I started, plenty of time. I finished peeing and pushed the door open, 7 minutes to spare. I raced out and made my way towards the hut. I was stopped short when a ringing bell caught my ear. *""Ding*"" a bell went off in the darkness. I checked my watch, a little under 7 minutes to spare. I stopped and peered into the black void of the cemetery, the ding came again, only sounding closer. That dry lump in my throat was coming back. I felt an unseen force try to lull me into the darkness, the ding came once again; I took a step towards it. I stopped, listened, *""Ding""* a bell rang towards my right, I could have sworn it was to my left a minute ago. 


Again, I felt the force pull me closer, it was comforting. *""Ding""* the bell rang, this time straight ahead, I nearly toppled over a gravestone that was broke in half. It was old, thick moss was growing on the side of it. I crouched down and felt the cold stone on the palm of my hand. I tried to make out the header. I squinted, shinning my phone light onto the grave. *""ROBERT""* it read, a sharp pain seized up my body, and my mind flashed back to Robert being wheeled out in a body bag. The bell rang again, towards my right, then again, towards my left, then again to the front, then to behind me, then above me. I frantically searched around, looking for the source, that's when it hit me. I wasn't supposed to leave for more than 10 minutes. I had been gone for 8 minutes when I checked my phone, I didn't realize how far I had wandered from the port-a-potty. 


I raced back the way I came, slamming my knees into gravestone I swore were not there when I first came. My shin rang in pain and I felt a warm trickle of blood race down my leg. I could barely see a few feet in front of me through the darkness. The hut was in sight, its bright luminous glow in a sea of darkness. I raced along, checking my phone from my pocket, got one minute. Then, I smashed into another gravestone, this one a bit bigger. My phone sprang from my hand towards the side into the darkness. My knee screamed in pain as I felt the electric hot pain surge through my body while I crashed into the grass. With a bolt of adrenaline, I leapt up and raced towards the hut, I had to of had only seconds left, thats when I realized I left my phone. I stopped at the hut door, unlocked it and looked back, I couldn't see it but I know I dropped it. I couldn't take a chance. I went inside and saw the extent of my knee, a bright red gash right on my knee cap, my pants stained red. I sat at the desk and dressed my wound as much as I could. 


Checking my watch became an ingrained memory at that point, how could I have been so dumb, why didn't I just check my watch. Cursing at my own stupidity, I was brought back to reality by a little clank agains the glass. I froze in place, did I hear what I just heard? Then again, a clang, a pebble hit the glass. I dove for the lights and before I could dive under the desk I met the gaze of a figure in the cemetery. It stood in the darkness, it's eyes glowing yellow. I stood frozen by this being, its eyes seeming to pulsate from within the darkness. Within a moments flash, something smashed into the glass, my phone. My phone was stuck in the glass half in my side as sparks shot out from it. From within the darkness, a hellish shriek came. I dove under the desk as the earth thudded and vibrated around me. 


It sounded like a bear was prowling out there, then the laughing started. The little girls laugh came in waves then the ground would shake like an earthquake, feeling like the whole hut would come down. I sat in the fetal position with my eyes shut. The girls laugh became more sinister and less human while the ground erupted around me. When I peaked out, bright yellow lights pulsated from within the darkness of the cemetery. I dove back under for safety and waited. I waited and waited, eventually having to piss myself as the yellow lights and vibrating ground continued for hours. For what felt like an eternity, until day began to rise.


My shift was nearing an end, but who was going to relieve my duty I thought. As the sun shone higher, I gathered enough courage to come out from under the desk. My bloodied leg stiff and sharp with pain. I let out a welp, and winced over. My phone lodged within the glass, I was unable to pry it out. An old silver Cadillac began to pull up the road, its windows tinted black. It raced along, dragging up clouds of dirt, I figured this must be the new morning guy. As I stepped out of the hut, took in the morning air and noticed my back tires were both slashed. Not having any spares, I had to get home. 


The Cadillac pulled up along side me and a pimply faced teen came out, he was led to the hut without saying a word or acknowledging me by a tall woman with bright red hair and big dark sunglasses, her skin as white as milk. She met my gaze and nodded slowly, maybe she is the one who contacts me on the radio I thought. Too exhausted to care, I gathered my things and limped towards my car. I could see the woman talking to the teen outside the hut, she was holding the laminated rules in her hand. My car painstakingly kicked to life while I carefully road down the path on two flats. I got home, with nearly my rims destroyed and changed the tires quickly. I took a long shower, cleaned my wounds and crashed into bed. I awoke later in the afternoon, did my daily ritual and prepared for my third shift. My leg was sore and achy, I wrapped it tight and took a couple of advils. Before I headed out for my car, my phone began to ring. 


*""Hello?""* I answered. Nothing. *""Hello*"" again I called. 


*""You broke some rules Henry did you?""* my mind raced back to later last night, all the horrific memories pouring back.


*""I...I didn't? or I thought I followed them, what now?""* I screamed out. 


*""Get to the cemetery""* the woman calmly spoke, *""I'll explain""*. With my bag already packed, I raced towards my car and frantically sped down the road. Night was already approaching, much quicker than usual. The streets were empty and the air felt hot, a murder of crows swarmed over head like a massive school of fish, I had a sick feeling bubbling in my stomach.

&lt;p&gt;Hello all, thank you for all the concerns. I think I am being watched right now, I feel like they are closing in on me. Before I tell you where I am, let me tell you about my second shift at the private cemetery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my first night, I went home and slept for about 30 minutes. So many thoughts were racing through my head. I knew what I heard, there was no mistaking the laughing. While I vaguely believe in the paranormal, I know what I heard. I looked over the list a few more times when I was home, each time sounding more crazier then the last. I looked up the cemetery online and found little information about it, everything about this place sounded like a mystery. As the day winded down, I barely realized that I hadn&amp;#39;t slept much since getting back from my first shift and I was 8 coffees deep, tonight was going to be a long night. I packed my backpack, brought some snacks and headed out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like before, the narrow dirt path was empty as the sun began to settle behind the tree tops. Ravens cawed and flew overhead as I descended deeper into the woods towards the cemetery. I approached the familiar steel gate, ravens rested on top of the sharp studded spikes that lined the length of the rusty gate. While I pulled into the cemetery, I noticed it wasn&amp;#39;t as quiet as the other night, no I was hearing something, sirens. I drove along the winding path, where my view of the hut was obscured by a dozen of police cars and ambulances. I froze panicking in my car, a cold sweat was running down my neck as I watched two paramedics wheel out a large black bag. Besides the hut, was the same car that was here yesterday, excepts its front window was caved in like someone threw a bowling ball through it, I only figured the red had to be blood. The paramedics wheeled out what appeared to be a body bag, my mind was racing while I tried to swallow the dry lump in my throat. I nearly jumped out of my skin when a nearby officer tapped his baton on my window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He motioned for me to roll down my windows, I didn&amp;#39;t even realize my hands were shaking &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sir if you do not work here i&amp;#39;m going to have to ask you to leave&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; the officer sternly asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shakily responded &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I...I do work here, what is going on?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; wiping my clay hands against my pant legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sir there has been an accident here, tell me now, do you know this gentleman&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; the officer handed me a picture of the morning security guard. He looked tired in the picture like he did the other night, again I thought he must not get enough sleep. My mind flashed back to the minutes of sleep I racked up in the previous two days. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Yes I do, is that him over there&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; pointing towards the body bag that was being wheeled into the ambulance*&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It is son, like I said there had been an accident, did you happen to have any ongoing contact with him, Robert I think his name was?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; the cop asked, leaning more into my car, his eyes scanning the back of my seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;No, I...I barely spoke to him, yesterday was my first day on the job, he is supposed to relieve me of my shift in the morning while I do him for the evening&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. I shakily replied, my voice cracking a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cop fumbled in his pocket, his suit was pressed sharply and his muscles bulged from his arms &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Son, why don&amp;#39;t you take my card, we may have some more questions for you in a bit. You said you relieve him of his shift in the evening, I&amp;#39;m assuming your here in front of me now about to do just that. While I can&amp;#39;t say exactly what, I will suggest that you be careful tonight son, I ain&amp;#39;t never seen anything like what happened to that boy in years&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wasn&amp;#39;t already on the verge of shitting my pants, what he told me made me close. I put his card in my back pocket and rolled up my window. The officer pointed me along where I parked alongside Roberts car. The bowling ball shaped hole in the windshield pointed inwards, like something was thrown through it from the outside; the jagged remainders of glass were painted red. A tow truck lifted the car onto its bed, the ambulances began to drive off and soon I was alone along the hut. The last to leave was the officer I spoke to before, he stood along his driver side door, met my gaze and nodded slowly before getting in and driving off. Before I could collect my thoughts, my phone vibrated. Another text message came in which read an additional months of advance pay had been transferred into my bank account. Soon enough, I got an email to confirm just that. I started to think I was going crazy now, either from lack of sleep or fright. My mind started racing, could the Robert have died from not following the rules? What made the hole in his car? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reluctantly grabbed my bag and headed inside the hut. Before I could sit down, the HAM radio began going off, it was only a couple minutes after my shift started. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I answered, clearing my throat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot; Glad to see you back, such a shame about Robert, he was with us for 3 years&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; a woman answered. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure you got the bank statement sent to you&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I nodded like she could see that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Good, well think of it as payment for seeing Robert go out like that, just keep quiet and more rewards will be sent you&amp;#39;re way&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; the receiver clicked off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great I thought, having to keep quiet just because I am getting paid off, I had to think about it. I had all night to wonder about Robert, as well as what I could do with the money now. While I rhymed over the endless possibilities of what to buy, I refreshed myself on the rules of the night which were neatly placed on the desk ready for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Do not investigate any ringing bells, no matter how close they sound, they aren&amp;#39;t
2.If bugs start landing on the huts glass window, burn the candles that are under the desk till your shifts end.
3.If pebbles are thrown at the huts glass, turn the light off and hide under the desk till the laughing stops.
4.If grave stones began to appear and reappear, go outside and pour oil over them, oil located under the desk.
5.If a gravedigger comes, do not approach him, let him come to the window, he will stare at you for a few hours but will leave after, DO NOT GO OUTSIDE WHILE HES HERE
6.Do not venture out past the great angel grave under any circumstance
7.Do not answer anyone talking from the HAM Radio except for the initial call when you came in.
8.Lock the hut after each time you step outside.
9.Do not leave for the bathroom for more than 10 minutes at time, if you have to, come back, wait, then go back.
10. If at any point you return to the hut, and see someone else sitting in the hut, get in your car and drive off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, a couple hours passed by, and I was starting to feel the effects of only limited sleep from before. I sucked down two RedBulls within those first few hours. Time seemed to stand still when the sun went down. The cemetery was swallowed by darkness and the world went quiet. Soon I was face to face with just the few graves I could see in front of me, I counted each to make sure I appeased rule number 4. While I struggled to stay awake, I was jolted up by the sound of the receiver from the radio going off. It hummed alive and struggled to catch a signal. I reactively went to grab it when I stopped myself short, number 7. I read the list again, sure enough, number 7, do not answer anyone talking from the HAM radio except for the initial cal when you came in. I held back and waited for the receiver to end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What seemed like an eternity, the receiver continued until a faint raspy voice began to speak from within the static. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;He...Hellloo....Helllo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; The voice from the receiver called out. I sat nervously in front of the receiver, my watch read 10pm. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hellloooo&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; drawn out the voice came in, more masculine each time. I tried to distract myself, I counted the graves, six, just like last time. Then, the receiver went out, the static stopped. I let out my breathe, which I didn&amp;#39;t even realize I was holding. I looked out into the cemetery, zoning out  a bit when something caught my attention. Trying to focus on my faint reflection in the glass, itt looked like something was behind me. I froze up, feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I squinted harder, trying to focus on the black shape in the dull reflection. When I gathered enough courage, I swiftly turned around, bracing for the worst; nothing. Again, I let out a sigh of relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The receiver shot to life with ear piercing static &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;HELLO!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; the mans voice roared out. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;HELLO! HELLO! HELO!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  each time the voice shrieked  higher in pitch. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; sounding like a demented clown who sucked too much helium. My ears were ringing, I plugged them and shut my eyes tight, then silence. The receiver clicked off. I held tight for a few moments, before I opened, I was alone. I scooted back from the radio and rested my head on the desk, tears were bubbling in the corner of my eyes. Before I could wallow in fright, my bladder began to hurt when I realized I really needed to pee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was something I was hoping I didn&amp;#39;t have to do, but the 8 coffees all day and two quick RedBulls weren&amp;#39;t doing me any favors. I reluctantly sat up, zippered my hoodie and braced myself to go outside. The port-a-potty was about 20 feet from the hut, right next to a massive oak tree with big spider web looking branches full of thick leaves. As I stepped outside the hut, rule 9 echoed in my head, 10 minutes I got, don&amp;#39;t forget to lock the door. I locked the door behind me and sped walked to the port-a-potty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached it in seconds, slamming the plastic door behind me and frantically reached my zipper. Waiting to pee, I started hearing rustling outside. The port-a-potty was dark, not a light except for the moonlight peering through the hole on the corner roof. I started to pee, despite the rustling growing louder. 2 minutes since I started, plenty of time. I finished peeing and pushed the door open, 7 minutes to spare. I raced out and made my way towards the hut. I was stopped short when a ringing bell caught my ear. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Ding&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; a bell went off in the darkness. I checked my watch, a little under 7 minutes to spare. I stopped and peered into the black void of the cemetery, the ding came again, only sounding closer. That dry lump in my throat was coming back. I felt an unseen force try to lull me into the darkness, the ding came once again; I took a step towards it. I stopped, listened, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Ding&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; a bell rang towards my right, I could have sworn it was to my left a minute ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I felt the force pull me closer, it was comforting. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Ding&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; the bell rang, this time straight ahead, I nearly toppled over a gravestone that was broke in half. It was old, thick moss was growing on the side of it. I crouched down and felt the cold stone on the palm of my hand. I tried to make out the header. I squinted, shinning my phone light onto the grave. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;ROBERT&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; it read, a sharp pain seized up my body, and my mind flashed back to Robert being wheeled out in a body bag. The bell rang again, towards my right, then again, towards my left, then again to the front, then to behind me, then above me. I frantically searched around, looking for the source, that&amp;#39;s when it hit me. I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to leave for more than 10 minutes. I had been gone for 8 minutes when I checked my phone, I didn&amp;#39;t realize how far I had wandered from the port-a-potty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raced back the way I came, slamming my knees into gravestone I swore were not there when I first came. My shin rang in pain and I felt a warm trickle of blood race down my leg. I could barely see a few feet in front of me through the darkness. The hut was in sight, its bright luminous glow in a sea of darkness.

The girls laugh became more sinister and less human while the ground erupted around me. When I peaked out, bright yellow lights pulsated from within the darkness of the cemetery. I dove back under for safety and waited. I waited and waited, eventually having to piss myself as the yellow lights and vibrating ground continued for hours. For what felt like an eternity, until day began to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My shift was nearing an end, but who was going to relieve my duty I thought. As the sun shone higher, I gathered enough courage to come out from under the desk. My bloodied leg stiff and sharp with pain. I let out a welp, and winced over. My phone lodged within the glass, I was unable to pry it out. An old silver Cadillac began to pull up the road, its windows tinted black. It raced along, dragging up clouds of dirt, I figured this must be the new morning guy. As I stepped out of the hut, took in the morning air and noticed my back tires were both slashed. Not having any spares, I had to get home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cadillac pulled up along side me and a pimply faced teen came out, he was led to the hut without saying a word or acknowledging me by a tall woman with bright red hair and big dark sunglasses, her skin as white as milk.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You broke some rules Henry did you?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; my mind raced back to later last night, all the horrific memories pouring back.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep," I lost my job ten days ago. It broke my heart. 

I had never thought I would love a job, during school I enjoyed none of the subjects. I didn’t enjoy anything about school at all really, I was a quiet girl from Fatima in Dublin but because my Ma got a job in Donnybrook I ended up going to a posh secondary school surrounded by posh arseholes from Dublin 4, all my friends were off enjoying themselves in the community school nearby while I got called a ‘knacker’ and a ‘scumbag’ on a daily basis because my parents had the audacity to hold regular paying jobs. They didn’t want me there and I didn’t want to be there.

The best part about school was the road out of the place because I knew when I got home I could retreat into my bubble and play video games for the rest of the evening, I guess this was another reason why I didn’t really fit in in my school, a lot of the girls there were stereotypically generic in how they acted, rich white girls who wanted their lives to be like an episode of *Gossip Girl*, but I wasn’t that. I was a nerdy girl who cared more about *PlayStation* trophies than I did about my outward appearance or what people thought of me. 

As I said I didn’t enjoy any subjects in school so I really didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life career-wise but when I began researching college courses I quickly found my dream job; **Game Developer**. So I applied for some Game Development courses around Ireland and I was offered a place in *Athlone Institute of Technology.* I had never lived anywhere else than Dublin but I knew this was my calling in life so I packed up my bags and moved to Athlone to pursue that calling. I studied the course for four years and ended up graduating with good grades, during my third year, I had to partake in some work experience and I worked for a small game development studio out of Galway City called *Prophecy Games*. I kept in contact with some of the employees and after graduating I was actually offered a full-time job with the company, the job that I have now been let go from. The first two years with the company were brilliant, I fell in love with game development and the city of Galway, but that all changed in the last year as the sales for the company began to fall and eventually the studio heads were forced to let go of 15 of us (over 70% of the workforce). 

I fell into a small bout of depression over the next few days, not leaving my house and finding it hard to even get out of my bed. I knew this wasn’t healthy for me so I forced myself up and out of the house deciding to go for a midnight walk to clear my head and hopefully gain an epiphany of sorts, I began wandering for a time until I found myself somewhat lost, something that must have been clearly obvious from my facial expression because I soon heard  
“Not from around here are ye?”   
The person questioning me was an elderly man who was sitting on a tree stump a couple of metres from me. He was wearing corduroy pants, a knitted cardigan and sandals while holding a walking stick.  


“Ehm, no I’m from Dublin but I live in Salthill. I’m not really sure where I am though” I responded while walking over to the man.  
He motioned for me to sit on the stump beside him by tapping it with the palm of his hand.  
“Ah ye aren’t too far out from there now. You’ll be grand getting back but she’s a cold aul night ye may take a taxi back” he said

“So what’s your name or will I be calling you girl for the conversation?” 

“Caoimhe, and yours?” I replied  
He looked off into the distance for a few seconds, focused on the few stars in the night sky which had not been obscured by the cirrus clouds. 

“Caoimhe is a lovely name, a strong, Irish name. Nice to meet you, Caoimhe. I’m **Bodach**” he said while reaching his hand out towards me to signal a handshake. His hands were old and wrinkly, they were covered in scars and broken skin, the signal of hard-working hands, most Irish men who grew up during the country's poorer periods had hands like his. I reached my own much younger hand out to shake his. His hands were completely ice-cold to touch, a freezing reaction shot up my arm that took me by such surprise I forgot to let go of his hand for a few seconds.

“So what is a pretty beure like yerself doing out alone at this time of night anyways? Not that I don’t think ye can handle yerself it’s just walking around alone in the middle of the night ain’t too normal” Bodach said to me while taking back ownership of his hand.

“I lost my job recently and I haven’t really been feeling myself lately so I guess I’m just out trying to clear my head” I replied

After I had uttered my reply Bodach began to grin from ear-to-ear, a large smile brandished across his aged face, the smile and glint in his eyes turned the freezing feeling that shot up my arm when we shook hands into a glacial sensation that consumed my entire body. Bodach had found a way to be inviting and unnerving simultaneously.

“Can I show ye something? It might just cheer ye up” he asked.

“Ehm...okay but it better not be anything weird.” I hesitantly replied to the old man.

Bodach stuck his index finger and thumb into his mouth and blew creating a blistering whistle which belted through the eerily quiet streets, there was a moment of complete silence sandwiched between the whistle and thundering gallops coming from the distance. The noise got closer and closer as the land beneath my feet shook more and more, the noise eventually revealed itself to be a large, snow-white stallion galloping into view. The horse towered over myself and Bodach as we sat. Bodach helped himself up from the stump with his walking stick and began to lightly brush his hand through the horse’s impressive, flowing mane. 

“This is my horse *Bataí*” Bodach informed me as he continued to rub the horse.

“He’s brought me round the ringer on more than one occasion.”

“D’ya want to take a ride on him?”

Bataí turned to look at me, my confused demeanour shining back at me from his obsidian eyes.  

“Ehm, I’m not really sure I haven’t rode a horse in years” I replied

“My cousin Mikey used to keep one in his garden that I used to ride but that was years ago” 

Bodach reached out and grabbed me by the arm, his tight hold on me was surprising and he was deceptively strong for his frame and age, he lifted me up from my seat and put me beside the horse.  
“Ah, you’ll be fine lassie there really ain’t much to it. He rides handy and does all the work,” he informed me.

It became apparent that the old man wasn’t going to let me leave until I rode his horse so I decided it would be easier for us all if I just had a light gallop on the beauty., I had always wished to get back into horse riding anyway. I grabbed onto the mighty stallion and with a help up from Bodach I threw myself onto its back. Once I got up and steadied myself Bodach gave me that chilling grin again.  
“Enjoy the ride and don’t let go! HA HA HA” he screamed before slapping the horse on the backside.

Bataí let out a blustering neigh and shot off sprinting, the horse began to run faster than I had thought a horse could run, the wind screamed in my ears as we roared through the streets. I held on tight to Bataí with my eyes closed as he continued to thrust forward, I reluctantly opened my eyes and saw that the snow-white stallion had turned a shadowy black and its eyes were glowing red like two pieces of fiery hot coal. As I moved my gaze downward I saw that the surface beneath was being burnt by a blaze of fire being left in the path of the horse. My mind was racing and I was thrust into a fight-or-flight panic. If I jumped off the horse at this speed I would surely be painted across the road beneath so flight was out of the question, fight it is. I took a small knife from out of my pocket that I made sure to carry with me whenever I went for a late-night walk, I pulled my arm back and thrust the knife into the neck of the beast as hard as I could but the knife bounced off the neck of the horse and snapped immediately on impact. I could neither fight or fly now so all I could think was to hold on tight and hope for the best. Bataí galloped onwards and onwards until we reached the pier at Salthill I had foolishly thought this would be the way to halt the stallion but instead, he blasted onto the water and powered out into the Atlantic Ocean, Bataí continued to pick up speed, sprinting faster and faster across the water every step creating large ripples on the water’s surface, my surroundings became blurred from the speed and my skin felt like it was going to tear off my body until we came to a screeching halt. I felt delirious atop Bataí and eventually fell off his back and face-first onto the hard ground beneath me.   
“Welcome Caoimhe, you’ve arrived a little sooner than I had expected,” said a coarse and powerful voice.

Suddenly the bones in my body felt like they were being crushed and trying to leap out of my skin and in an instant, I was lifted off the ground and held up in the air, my lungs felt as if they were going to explode as I struggled to breathe. I could only slightly raise my head but I could do it just enough to identify the owner of the coarse voice. Before me stood a man around 7 feet tall, he looked powerfully strong, he had long, flowing, white hair which somewhat obscured his face and hung down just past the shoulder blades of his heavy and intricate armour that was covered in Celtic circles. His right eye was a glowing red similar to Bataí’s and his left eye was completely white and most likely blind. 

“Do you know who I am child?” the man asked me.  
I couldn’t think straight, I attempted to answer his question but when I opened my mouth the lack of air in my lungs only allowed me to let out a whimpering cough. 

“I am Balor, the Demon King of the Otherworld and your life is now in my hands,” he said.

I felt blood slowly drip down from my nose and into my open mouth the metallic taste stinging my tongue. Balor was suspending me from above the ground and crushing my body in on itself while standing calmly as if he was waiting for a bus. 

“Tell me, my child, do you want to die?” he asked me while turning his back to me, his arms folded behind his back.

“Wha...What?” I replied.

“Death, do you wish it upon yourself? Should I crush your bones to dust and toss your soul to the Lake of the Damned?” he quickly responded to me.

“No, no I would prefer to live if I’m honest” I struggled to reply to the Demon King who stood before me. My facial expression didn’t show it but I was terrified, my heart pounded in my chest as I waited for him to kill me. 

“Good because I have use for you” he responded

“My power here is immense, I would be sure you’d agree. In the mortal world, however, my power has waned, my followers used to praise my name and at Samhain, my emissaries would cross the mortal barrier and collect souls for my army but this has changed in recent times. My soldiers haven’t crossed over in generations and I have lost my most loyal follower, *The Dullahan.* This is where you come in Caoimhe, this is where we have a mutual need for each other”

“Why would I ever need you? You maniac.” I said instantly regretting insulting the immortal being standing before me. 

“Well because you need me not to kill you, to allow you to continue to experience the mortal world and to allow you to make something of yourself and I need you to collect the souls of the wicked for me, to help me grow my army once again,” he said while lightly wiping the stream of blood from beneath my nose. 

“I need you to become my new Dullahan, Caoimhe. What do you say?” 

As I floated above the ground unable to move I was astutely aware of how little I had a choice in the matter, deny him and I would be swiftly dealt with but self-preservation wasn’t the only motivation against my soon-to-be vocal decision. All my life I’d been a pushover, doing what others told me and never speaking up, my parents pushed me into a school they knew I’d hate and I never stood up for myself, in that horrific hellhole I was constantly pushed around by little rich bitches and I just let them do it. They called me poor, smelly, ugly, a pig and I would lower my head and walk on. When life was finally going well and I found my dream job fate made a mockery of me once more, well no more for now on my fate is in my hands. 

“Okay, I’ll do it. I give you my soul” I said while smiling viciously back at Balor.

He reciprocated the smile before theatrically snapping his fingers and I fell to the dusty cave floor. I pushed myself up from the ground and onto my knees, my bones still aching.

“I felt you would,” he replied

“In giving me your soul you give me your essence. Taking your essence as my own I imbue it with my power and baptise you as my emissary and collector of debts.” 

Balor took out a knife and cut his right palm opening a crimson coloured wound on his alabaster skin. He reached out his hand and placed it on my forehead. His baltic touch made Bodach feel warm in comparison as his blood trickled down my face. 

“Caoimhe Paula Smith will be no more when you awaken she will be nothing more than a name. You will arise from her ashes born anew as *The Dullahan, rider of darkness and collector of souls”*

Balor took his palm slowly off my head and in an instant I was thrown from the Otherworld, flailing through a darkened tunnel with the only visible objects the screaming faces of lost souls stuck in the cave walls. I flew by the screaming heads of the wicked before slamming into the ground and awaking in my bed. I climbed out of the bed groggy and delirious barely able to find my way down the stairs and into my kitchen. I began to wonder if I had dreamed the whole thing, the walk, the meeting with Bodach and my agreement with Balor, I began to think my desire to be more important than a meaningless soul traversing through life without leaving any mark had culminated in this elaborate almost lucid dream.   
I began to think all of these things before I pulled the blinds aside in my kitchen and saw standing in my back garden a titan of a stallion as black and he was beautiful with sullen, shining carmine eyes. 

[Time to get to work.](https://twitter.com/midniteauth0r)",t2_4sot6ljn,False,,0,False,An Unexpected Job Proposal,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fglzmp,False,dark,,public,28,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,28,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583906518.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lost my job ten days ago. It broke my heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never thought I would love a job, during school I enjoyed none of the subjects. I didn’t enjoy anything about school at all really, I was a quiet girl from Fatima in Dublin but because my Ma got a job in Donnybrook I ended up going to a posh secondary school surrounded by posh arseholes from Dublin 4, all my friends were off enjoying themselves in the community school nearby while I got called a ‘knacker’ and a ‘scumbag’ on a daily basis because my parents had the audacity to hold regular paying jobs. They didn’t want me there and I didn’t want to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about school was the road out of the place because I knew when I got home I could retreat into my bubble and play video games for the rest of the evening, I guess this was another reason why I didn’t really fit in in my school, a lot of the girls there were stereotypically generic in how they acted, rich white girls who wanted their lives to be like an episode of &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/em&gt;, but I wasn’t that. I was a nerdy girl who cared more about &lt;em&gt;PlayStation&lt;/em&gt; trophies than I did about my outward appearance or what people thought of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said I didn’t enjoy any subjects in school so I really didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life career-wise but when I began researching college courses I quickly found my dream job; &lt;strong&gt;Game Developer&lt;/strong&gt;. So I applied for some Game Development courses around Ireland and I was offered a place in &lt;em&gt;Athlone Institute of Technology.&lt;/em&gt; I had never lived anywhere else than Dublin but I knew this was my calling in life so I packed up my bags and moved to Athlone to pursue that calling. I studied the course for four years and ended up graduating with good grades, during my third year, I had to partake in some work experience and I worked for a small game development studio out of Galway City called &lt;em&gt;Prophecy Games&lt;/em&gt;. I kept in contact with some of the employees and after graduating I was actually offered a full-time job with the company, the job that I have now been let go from. The first two years with the company were brilliant, I fell in love with game development and the city of Galway, but that all changed in the last year as the sales for the company began to fall and eventually the studio heads were forced to let go of 15 of us (over 70% of the workforce). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell into a small bout of depression over the next few days, not leaving my house and finding it hard to even get out of my bed. I knew this wasn’t healthy for me so I forced myself up and out of the house deciding to go for a midnight walk to clear my head and hopefully gain an epiphany of sorts, I began wandering for a time until I found myself somewhat lost, something that must have been clearly obvious from my facial expression because I soon heard&lt;br/&gt;
“Not from around here are ye?”&lt;br/&gt;
The person questioning me was an elderly man who was sitting on a tree stump a couple of metres from me. He was wearing corduroy pants, a knitted cardigan and sandals while holding a walking stick.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ehm, no I’m from Dublin but I live in Salthill. I’m not really sure where I am though” I responded while walking over to the man.&lt;br/&gt;
He motioned for me to sit on the stump beside him by tapping it with the palm of his hand.&lt;br/&gt;
“Ah ye aren’t too far out from there now. You’ll be grand getting back but she’s a cold aul night ye may take a taxi back” he said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So what’s your name or will I be calling you girl for the conversation?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Caoimhe, and yours?” I replied&lt;br/&gt;
He looked off into the distance for a few seconds, focused on the few stars in the night sky which had not been obscured by the cirrus clouds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Caoimhe is a lovely name, a strong, Irish name. Nice to meet you, Caoimhe. I’m &lt;strong&gt;Bodach&lt;/strong&gt;” he said while reaching his hand out towards me to signal a handshake. His hands were old and wrinkly, they were covered in scars and broken skin, the signal of hard-working hands, most Irish men who grew up during the country&amp;#39;s poorer periods had hands like his. I reached my own much younger hand out to shake his. His hands were completely ice-cold to touch, a freezing reaction shot up my arm that took me by such surprise I forgot to let go of his hand for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So what is a pretty beure like yerself doing out alone at this time of night anyways? Not that I don’t think ye can handle yerself it’s just walking around alone in the middle of the night ain’t too normal” Bodach said to me while taking back ownership of his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I lost my job recently and I haven’t really been feeling myself lately so I guess I’m just out trying to clear my head” I replied&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had uttered my reply Bodach began to grin from ear-to-ear, a large smile brandished across his aged face, the smile and glint in his eyes turned the freezing feeling that shot up my arm when we shook hands into a glacial sensation that consumed my entire body. Bodach had found a way to be inviting and unnerving simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can I show ye something? It might just cheer ye up” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ehm...okay but it better not be anything weird.” I hesitantly replied to the old man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bodach stuck his index finger and thumb into his mouth and blew creating a blistering whistle which belted through the eerily quiet streets, there was a moment of complete silence sandwiched between the whistle and thundering gallops coming from the distance.

&lt;p&gt;“He’s brought me round the ringer on more than one occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“D’ya want to take a ride on him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bataí turned to look at me, my confused demeanour shining back at me from his obsidian eyes.  &lt;/p&gt;

Maya and I used to play in the willow, when we were young and relatively carefree. In fact our only problems were Evan Dartwood and if we were going to get puppies for our birthday. Our parents used to say that we weren’t born as twins to one family because they couldn’t handle us.  It was simple back then. You know?

When Maya took her own life at age 17 we were all shocked. She was so happy, so friendly, so animated and like my Maya. But she hung herself from the willow we spent our entire youths at. I think she wanted to be found by me. For me to cut her down and rest her head in my lap as I braided her hair sobbing while waiting for the cops to arrive. 

I moved out as soon as I, a half of two twin-friends, turned 18. I moved to the city where I met a wonderful girl, fell in love, adopted a dog. Had a great life.

But the past has a way of finding you. I have had dreams of the willow since October 23rd. The anniversary of Maya’s death. It’s calling to me. Beckoning me to be next.

I couldn’t ignore it’s siren call so I snuck out tonight, brought the chainsaw and drove the Jeep the hour west to my hometown.

I pulled onto Harper Avenue, the street where the empty nature park stands and hefted my chainsaw onto my shoulder.

I retraced my steps on autopilot, a new memory emerging each step.

Step. Maya and I just found the willow. We called it fort win. We thought it sounded like for-twin as in for the twins.

Step. We had two birthday parties. Mine in the morning at my house hers in the afternoon at her house.

Step. I broke my arm climbing the willow. Maya made a splint using willow branches and a stick.

Step. We just finished our first double date and we both feel like we could soar. We sit under the stars just before the curtain of the willow branches and talk.

Step. The lifeless body of Maya stares at me from the tree, her skin already taking on a grey-ish hue and her eyes are hazy, like a galaxy. A galaxy in a dead-girls eyes.

I look up at the willow. “You expected me to bring rope?” I ask the tree as I rev my chainsaw.

I cut into the willow. I feel as though large spiders are climbing up and down my back. I ignore the feeling. I hear Maya’s familiar sing-songy voice. I keep cutting into the willow. The willow is ready for its final cut.

“Don’t leave me alone. Please.” I hear those words and I sob. Because I know Maya is here and I know that she saw me leave 4 years ago.

I turn and see my best friend, as young as she was when she died standing next to me. Her eyes are galaxies, but not hazy like those of a dead girl. No they are the eyes of someone who has been the abyss. She hasn’t stared into it, waiting for it to blink at her. No, she is the abyss. A welcome abyss. I smile painfully as I rev the engine once more and cut into the willow.

The angle is right and it topples over me.

My back is broken and I am sure to die before the sun rises. I’m just glad I brought my phone to tell this story. Because where the willow lies is where you can find us one day. One day, someone will walk into this and be greeted by the song of old friends. Laughter, crying, jokes, insults. It will be Maya and I’s song and it will be sung soon enough.",t2_3ej6zxje,False,,0,False,Where the Willow Lies,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgswdu,False,dark,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583937515.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the Willow lies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step. Maya and I just found the willow. We called it fort win. We thought it sounded like for-twin as in for the twins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step. We had two birthday parties. Mine in the morning at my house hers in the afternoon at her house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step. I broke my arm climbing the willow. Maya made a splint using willow branches and a stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step. We just finished our first double date and we both feel like we could soar. We sit under the stars just before the curtain of the willow branches and talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step. The lifeless body of Maya stares at me from the tree, her skin already taking on a grey-ish hue and her eyes are hazy, like a galaxy. A galaxy in a dead-girls eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look up at the willow. “You expected me to bring rope?” I ask the tree as I rev my chainsaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut into the willow. I feel as though large spiders are climbing up and down my back. I ignore the feeling. I hear Maya’s familiar sing-songy voice. I keep cutting into the willow. The willow is ready for its final cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t leave me alone. Please.” I hear those words and I sob. Because I know Maya is here and I know that she saw me leave 4 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turn and see my best friend, as young as she was when she died standing next to me. Her eyes are galaxies, but not hazy like those of a dead girl. No they are the eyes of someone who has been the abyss. She hasn’t stared into it, waiting for it to blink at her. No, she is the abyss. A welcome abyss. I smile painfully as I rev the engine once more and cut into the willow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angle is right and it topples over me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My back is broken and I am sure to die before the sun rises. I’m just glad I brought my phone to tell this story. Because where the willow lies is where you can find us one day. One day, someone will walk into this and be greeted by the song of old friends. Laughter, crying, jokes, insults. It will be Maya and I’s song and it will be sung soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"I used to work as a security guard at the mall a few miles away from my house. I’m going to tell you about the case that made me quit. More than anything else, I want you all to help me with something. I want you to tell me what I should do. I’ll explain the story and ask a more in depth question at the end.

So, there was one night where I wasn’t working and I was enjoying my night off. Nothing bad or weird happened to me that night. When I went into work the next day, I found out that a man had been found dead in the downstairs Old Navy. I learned his name, but out of respect, I’ll call him Anthony. The workers were obviously horrified when they opened up the shop doors in the morning and found a man’s body laying in the middle of the store floor. They had to close the store for the entire day so no customers would find out. The strange part was that there was absolutely no evidence showing what exactly happened to him. Almost everything in the store seemed untouched, and there was nothing around him to indicate a possible weapon. They asked me to look through the security cameras to see what happened to him. I agreed.

Big mistake.

I opened up the security footage for Old Navy and rewinded all the way back to the previous night at about 8 P.M. I didn’t see anything for a while, but I sat and waited until I saw the man enter. At about 8:40, Anthony walked in. There were only a few people left in there because the mall would close in 20 minutes. The store manager saw Anthony and told him this fact. Anthony agreed and said that he just had to go to the bathroom. He clumsily waddled into the men’s room nervously clutching the area between his pants. He found his way to a stall and leaned against the side of it. I fast forwarded the camera and looked away as he did his business. I looked back hesitantly after a bit and saw that he was passed out inside the stall. I rewinded a few seconds and saw that while he was leaning against the stall wall, it seemed like he was relying on it for support. He must have zoned out or fallen asleep standing up or something because he fell down and smacked head on the cement wall on the way down. He knocked himself out cold.

I fast forwarded to the part where he woke up. I was a little angry that the store maintenance didn’t come in and check the bathrooms before closing, but I wasn’t surprised. The cleaning staff in the mall has always been notoriously lazy and never do their jobs well. When Anthony woke up, I stopped fast forwarding and let the video play. At this point, it was about 9:20. He probably realized that he had been passed out for a while, so he scrambled to his feet. He gently rubbed the tender spot on his head where he hit the wall. It was quickly growing into a nasty rugged bruise.

Anthony yanked open the bathroom door handle and ran into the main section of the store, except he only took a few steps in before he quickly halted himself. The store, as well as the entire rest of the mall, was closed. This meant that all the lights were off, and all the doors were closed and locked. Anthony could only see darkness. Nothing else. He was locked in.

When the room is pitch black for more than a minute or two, the cameras automatically switch to night vision mode, so I continued watching with ease. Anthony did not have this luxury, so he started feeling around the walls and squinting through the darkness to try and find some sort of lightswitch or flashlight he could use. There was suddenly the sound of a loud rustle and what sounded like something moving. The cameras are not very good at picking up sound, and even I heard it. Anthony panicked slightly, but he tried (not very well) to remain cool. He began to frantically feel along the walls to find anything that could help. He eventually felt something slightly sticking out of the wall. He didn’t think twice before flicking it up. Thank God it was a lightswitch. Most of the lights in the store’s main section turned on and gave Anthony sight again. The night vision camera nearly blinded me for a moment before deactivating and switching back to regular camera settings. He looked around the store. He was probably looking to see if there was any sort of person or animal sneaking around, but there was no one.

Anthony began walking around the store, surveying his surroundings. There were several large metal gates sealing all the front entrances shut. He looked around for any other possible way out. But everywhere he looked he just saw clothing. There were shelves everywhere. Absolutely filled with clothes. They were covering every single mannequin. Then he saw all the mannequins.

I’ve never liked those goddamn mannequins. There must’ve been at least twenty of them. They looked like they were everywhere with the bodies positioned in every which way. Looking in every direction with their lifeless faces and plastic bodies and accessories. They were enough to give you the chills if you were too scared. I’ve always wondered why stores even started using them in the first place.

Then suddenly, a huge crash of thunder scared Anthony half to death. It was storming outside that night. Bad. There was a terrible thunderstorm for a few hours. I knew the store would probably lose power at any moment. He knew this too, so that gave him even more motivation to start finding a way out. He started walking over to the other end of the store looking for any other exits, but on his way over, just as I predicted, all the lights in the store went out. They came back on again after a few seconds, but in that brief moment of pitch black darkness, I could barely hear something move again. That meant that Anthony definitely heard it too. I could tell he was trying to brush it off as something else, but what bothered me was the fact that the cameras never turned off. If the power went off, the cameras would be diabled and would need to be rebooted, but they stayed fully functional. I didn’t understand.

Anthony walked all the way to the back of the store, but found a bunch of small offices. No exits. As he turned back around to go back to the main section of the store, the lights flickered off and on again. This time, they stayed off for slightly longer. I was hoping that at any moment the night vision would switch on so I could see what was happening, but the lights came on again soon. The cameras stayed on yet again. This time, the store was different.

Anthony walked back into the store’s main section and stopped for a moment. He looked at all the mannequins in front of him. He could swear that at least five of them were turned towards him, and at least two of them were looking him dead in the eyes. I’m positive that they were not in those positions before, but he tried to pay no mind to them. He walked towards the main help desk and started looking through drawers. I could assume he was looking for some sort of keyring or something else to break out with.

The lights went out again, but they came back up after only about five seconds. Anthony looked back out towards the store. He looked at the mannequins. Almost all of them were looking at him or facing him in some way. Their dead-panned, lifeless faces pierced Anthony’s soul. I could sense this and I was just watching it in complete safety. Some of the mannequins had clearly moved a substantial amount. Some of their arms were in completely different positions, and their bodies were beginning to shape in a way that only a human body could. A few of them had completely moved off of the panels they were initially displayed on, and they seemed to be moving towards Anthony.

He began to breathe very quickly and nervously. He backed away from the desk and ran back down towards the narrow bathroom hallway. He probably thought it was a safer place. He forcefully pushed on the door, but it didn’t budge. He tried pushing it again, but it didn’t open. Poor Anthony. He didn’t realize that the workers always lock all the doors in the workplace before leaving. He was able to leave the bathroom, but he couldn’t get back in. He pounded the door hard with his fist. Then, almost as if on cue, it got pitch black again. The lights were off for what seemed like an eternity. I most definitely heard many footsteps moving around the store. I prayed that Anthony was moving around them and was escaping the store at this very moment.

The light came back on, the cameras were still on, and Anthony stood in the same spot he was when the lights went out. We were both terribly startled when we saw a large group of mannequins crowding the hallway directly in front of him. There were at least ten of them that were reaching out towards him like a bunch of zombies. But their faces still remained fixed in their default smile.

Anthony quickly looked for space in the hallway. The mannequins were crowding him, and if he didn’t move out of there right now, the mannequins would corner him and. . . and do something to him. The only way to avoid them was by going back down that hallway and scooting out of the way of all the mannequins. In order to do that, Anthony would have to inch past each and every one while praying to heaven that the lights didn’t go out while he was there. So that’s just what he did. He quickly and carefully maneuvered his way around the huge pack of plastic people, and with every one he passed, I would pray as hard as he could that the lights would stay on. It’s odd. I hadn’t really felt this sort of feeling before, and I’ve never felt it since then. It was a sense of hoping and praying that he would get by each mannequin even though I knew exactly how this whole situation would end. I can only describe it as “hopeful dread”. I guess the best I can compare it to is when you’re watching a movie where a character makes a big mistake. Then, the next time you watch it, you pray that the character makes a different decision even though you already know what happens and what the outcome is. Sorry, I’m rambling.

He eventually got out of the hallway without a scratch on him. He quickly ran to the opposite side of the store and away from the hoard of death. Now he could begin to catch his breath. He looked towards the bathroom hallway and saw the backs of all the mannequins. They were all still facing that spot on the bathroom door where he once stood. At this point, we both knew that the mannequins only moved when the lights turned off. So long as the lights stay on, he would be safe.

I shouldn’t have been thinking that because the moment the thought entered my head, the darkness surrounded the screen once more. This time, it stayed off for longer than before. I counted down from 2 minutes and waited until the night vision mode kicked in, but it never got there. I initially thought that he should move and find somewhere else safe, but that would’ve be stupid. The mannequins knew where he was no matter what, and even if they didn’t, Anthony would most likely trip and fall over something which would get himself killed even faster. Then suddenly, I just listened for a moment. I heard the static noise of the camera, but I couldn’t hear the storm any more. Before, I heard the vicious thunder and rain as it poured down on the mall’s roof, but I couldn’t hear anything anymore. That didn’t make any sense. If the storm was gone, then how was the power still out? How were the lights still flickering? Why were the cameras still in perfect working order?

Then the lights came back on. Anthony was backed against a wall. Every single mannequin in the store was about a half foot away from Anthony’s face. All of their arms and legs were extended out to him, and all of their dead eyes were staring into his soul. When the lights turned off again, every single mannequin would do something ungodly to Anthony.

Well, all except one.

Anthony wasn’t able to move out of his position, but he was able to see out into the store, and he saw one lone mannequin who was far separated from the others. I could clearly see this mannequin too. This one was a woman with a great big smile, short blonde hair, and a red handbag. She was in a corner that was a little hard to see from cameras, so I could have easily missed her if I wasn’t looking for her. She was standing against the wall on the opposite side of the store as Anthony. She had her arm outstretched towards the wall, and her finger was getting ready to touch something, but I couldn’t see what it was at first. I shifted to another camera on the other wall and zoomed in. I saw what she was about to touch. Her finger was hovering directly over the light switch. The storm wasn’t making the lights flicker on and off. It was the mannequins. He was at their mercy in that moment. He looked back at the woman’s face. She wasn’t looking at the lightswitch; she was looking directly at Anthony with her great big smile, just like all the others. His stress and anxiety must have been unimaginable. Nothing could ever compare to being deathly stared down by a bunch of oversized dolls. He tried shouting and telling the mannequin no, but he knew it wouldn’t do any good. It’s a damn mannequin.

Eventually, Anthony gave up on pleading. He looked back at the mannequin’s finger and waited. The last thing we saw was the small plastic finger move down every so slightly. Then, darkness enveloped the screen. Darkness, and nothing else. I heard screaming and lots of movement from the screen. I desperately wanted to know what was happening but also never ever wanted to know what fate he was suffering in that moment. I heard silence after a while. This time, the night vision mode did turn on, and when it did, I saw the store just as it looked this morning. I still to this day do not know what happened to that man, and at this point, I don’t ever want to know.

I need you guys to tell me what to do now. After a few more moments of watching the motionless store, I pressed stop, and I did my best to destroy all the surveillance footage from that night. I couldn’t let anyone know. I walked out and told them all that the store cut off the power to the camera and they didn’t record anything major. I quit right after that. Should I go back and tell them the truth? I do feel bad. Leaving that store with those monsters still inside. There’s only one big reason I don’t want to go back and tell the mall about what happened. One small feature bothered me about the end of the surveillance video. When Anthony’s body laid lifeless on the floor and the mannequins returned to their regular store poses, one mannequin was still off. The female one that had turned off the lightswitch for the final time. She was striking her appropriate pose, but she was staring directly into the camera. Directly at me. She knew I was there. She knew I was watching. Now, she’s watching me.",t2_3pdh0fhd,False,,0,False,Don’t look at a mall’s overnight security cameras,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fg6uxz,False,dark,,public,821,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,821,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583836680.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to work as a security guard at the mall a few miles away from my house.

,nosleep,"[I stared at the severed ear, limbs trembling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fdvplk/my_dog_has_gained_one_pound_a_day_for_the_past/) Marley had never attacked a human before. Had his appetite for violence taken such a horrific leap? The thought of him desecrating a person like he did rabbits, or squirrels, filled me with dread. 

Surely there had to be another explanation for the ear’s sudden appearance in my yard. Maybe he had dug up a grave—we lived near a cemetery—or found a discarded movie prop. 

But what about the blood? The iron scent drifting from the hole certainly wasn’t corn syrup. I’m a nurse—I know what blood smells like. The congealed, crimson mass lining the fence was the real deal, and mortified me with its implications. 

I resisted the urge to call the police. The least I could do was investigate the matter before condemning Marley for a crime he didn’t commit. So I grabbed a ladder from my garage, propped it against the fence, and climbed into my neighbor’s yard. 

The ladder creaked as I leapt off the top rung, then tumbled to the ground. I cringed as it crashed into a tree and sent the gathered birds fleeing into the sky. 

I glanced towards my neighbor’s house, heart pounding in my ears. Fortunately, nobody appeared in the windows. 

Whether this meant they simply weren’t home, or were wedged between Marley’s teeth, I didn’t yet know. 

I scanned the yard, trying to locate Marley. Tall rose bushes circled the fence, filling the air with a sweet aroma. Two sprawling oak trees dominated the center of the yard. Their untrimmed braches blocked the sun and cast deep shadows along the grass. 

I called Marley’s name, voice a hoarse whisper. But only the wind greeted my ears, freezing the sweat collecting on my brow. 

I leaned against the closest tree, debating about what I should do. Marley obviously wasn’t here. He would’ve come running the moment he heard his name, or at the very least barked. That the yard remained silent told me that he had either fled down the alleyway, or escaped into the neighborhood. 

Just as I was about to return to my yard, I heard a single bark explode from my neighbor’s house. Although this bark was faint, it was clearly Marley’s. 

A thousand questions swam through my mind. What was Marley doing inside the house? Bradley hated dogs. And besides, he was the most reclusive man I had ever seen. The thought of him stealing Marley shocked me even more than the ear languishing in the dirt behind me. 

Another bark sounded through the window, this one louder. 

I sprinted over to the window and peered into the living room. Unfortunately, the room was too dark for me to see anything, so I retreated from the glass, heart pounding. 

I paced through the shadows, deliberating what my next move should be. Knocking on Bradley’s door was the obvious solution, but what if he hid Marley the moment he heard my knock? If he had truly stolen my dog, then he wouldn’t relinquish him without a fight. For this reason, I decided a covert approach would yield better results. 

So I crept towards the backdoor on silent feet, breath shallow. 

Luckily the doorknob turned with ease, and I passed into the kitchen unnoticed. 

The curtains were drawn, shrouding the kitchen in darkness. I ducked behind the bar. If Bradley was home, then I couldn’t let him discover me. Despite the likelihood that he had stolen Marley, breaking into his house was still illegal. He could have me arrested, or at the very least fined. 

The anger I felt at Marley’s abduction surprised me. I had considered giving him up for adoption only a few days ago. That I was so hell-bent on rescuing him proved to me once and for all that I truly loved him, regardless of the trouble he caused me. 

I remained crouched behind the bar, heart roaring in my ears, for five minutes. The house remained silent for the entirety of this time, convincing me that Bradley was away. 

I stood up and walked into the living room. 

What I saw sent me stumbling back into the hall. 

Bradley was laying in the middle of the floor, limbs reduced to bloody stumps. Beside him laid Marley, face stained with gore and fast asleep. 

My head struck the wall. The sound made Bradley raise his head. 

Our eyes locked.

He screamed. 

\---

Bradley’s hoarse scream awoke Marley and sent him jumping to his feet. He stared at Bradley for a few moments, face contorted with rage, then wrapped his jaws around the ruined mass of flesh that used to be his arm. 

Bradley hollered with pain as blood poured from his festering flesh. 

Stars swam in front of my vision as I bolted to my feet. My lungs constricted as I watched Marley gnaw on his exposed bones. I opened my mouth to command Marley to release him, but my words never passed my throat. The sight of Bradley’s wounds—and the bump quickly forming on my head—stunned me into silence. 

“Help me!” roared Bradley. 

The sound of his gravely voice tearing through the air jolted me from my stupor. 

“Marley!” I said. “Let go!” 

Other than raising his ears, Marley ignored my command. He had gone completely feral. The ferociousness of his gaze resembled a hunting wolf rather than a house dog. 

“Marley! Sit!”

Marley continued gnawing. 

Feeling the situation spinning out of control, I sprinted into the room and pushed Marley away. He howled as his feet skidded across the floor like skipping stones, then barred his teeth and growled. 

I wrapped my hands around Bradley’s armpits. The odor of his decomposing flesh drifted to my nose, causing me to gag. 

The moment I started dragging him into the hallway Marley barked and sprinted towards us. 

His jaws enveloped my calf before I had time to react. Tears filled my eyes as he tore off a mouthful of muscle and swallowed it whole. I swatted at him with my hands, sending Bradley crashing to the ground. 

Marley yelped as my fist crashed into his nose. He jumped back, stunned. I had never hit him in the five years that I owned him. That I had crossed such an extreme boundary surprised him as much as it did me.

Knowing that I might not receive another opportunity to drag Bradley to safety, I re-wrapped my hands around his armpits and dragged him into the kitchen. We passed into the pantry just as Marley resumed his growling and stepped into the hall. 

A nauseating mixture of blood and spices filled my nostrils. I looked down at Bradley, and nearly cringed when I saw how badly Marley had mutilated his face. 

“I’m going to get you out of here,” I said, voice breathless. “Give me a second to call the police.”

I grabbed Beth’s hand and tried to reassure her. I said:

“Beth? Beth. It’s okay. They’re all just conspiracy theories. You heard what the WHO said. As long as you’re young and healthy, you’ll have no problem surviving the virus.”

“They are *not* just conspiracy theories.” A young Asian man shouted loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear.

Once he had the attention of everyone, he said:

“I follow the news in China. They say that the government is hiding the actual numbers. We’re told there’s 30,000 infected people, but that’s not the truth.”

“Well, what is the truth then?” A woman in her thirties who had a waitress’ uniform asked.

“At least 150,000 have been infected in China alone, confirmed from reputable Chinese sources.”

There were a few scoffs and gasps in the room, as murmurs filled the air.

“It’s true.” The old man at the counter said, as he loaded a magazine with bullets “I heard the same news. My son lives in Hong Kong, says the numbers are suspected to be way higher than what they’re told. They’re trying to keep it under wraps to prevent widespread panic.”

“Well what about these freaks outside? What the hell happened to them?” I asked.

There was a loud bang on the shutter, making everyone in the room jump. We kept quiet for a moment in anticipation while the screams outside permeated the air, but luckily nothing else happened.

“No idea.” The old man shrugged “All I do know is, we can’t get out now. Whoever is infected and I assume that’s most of the town by now, has probably gone batshit crazy. If we have any infected people here, they’ll probably become the same way.”

“You don’t know that.” I protested “We don’t know what went down with those people.”

A loud click permeated the room, as the man loaded the magazine into his handgun. He placed the gun on the counter and said:

“Guess we’ll find out soon.”

Since we no longer had cellphone reception, the old man suggested we stay put until the government decided to do something, as slim as those chances were. He stocked up on canned goods long before the outbreak, because he anticipated something like this would happen. He had enough to last the eight of us around a week, if we rationed it properly. He was willing to selflessly share it with us.

We had time to kill, so we got to know each other. The old man’s name was Stan and he ran his shop alone. His kids lived in Seattle, so he wasn’t overly worried about them just yet. The Chinese guy’s name was Xiaotian, but since no one could pronounce it, he told us to call him Frank. The middle-aged woman who managed to get inside the shop before Beth and I was called Marianne and the waitress’ name was Cindy. Finally, there was a mother with her child and their names were Elizabeth and Mark. The two of them mostly spent time huddled in the corner, with her constantly having to re-explain to the kid why they couldn’t go home yet.

“Oh, by the way.” Stan said “This door behind me leads upstairs to my room. If anyone wants to get some sleep or fresh air, you can get to the rooftop here.”

Beth and I exchanged glances, silently agreeing to go upstairs to observe the situation more clearly. We opened the door behind Stan and he frowned at us, before saying:

“Hey. Don’t go doing any nasty things on my bed.”

We ignored him and climbed the stairs. The door at the end of the stairwell opened into a small, dim room, crammed with a bed, closet, TV and other basic things that could fit inside. The room was messy, with the bed sheets half on the bed and half on the floor, clothes piled in various parts of the room and empty beer bottles on the nightstand.

“Better than nothing, I guess.” I said and looked at the small latter in the corner of the room.

It was placed under the rooftop access door, which seemed to open upwards. I climbed up first and pushed the door open, immediately letting rays of grey light inside. I climbed out and immediately, the sounds of screams on the streets surrounding the building became louder.

“Come on, Beth.” I helped her up.

I looked around the roof and said:

“Well, I guess we’ll be safe here for a while, until the dust settles at least. Even if they break in, we can just close the hatch and we’ll be fine, yeah?”

“Yeah.” Beth said, almost in a whisper.

I went to the edge of the roof and leaned on it, while Beth joined next to me. 

“Jesus, look at that.” I said, not believing the sight in front of me.

There were dozens of those freaks on the streets, just running in random directions, attacking any normal people that happened to find themselves in their way. The streets were already littered with countless dead bodies, mutilated in all sorts of unimaginable ways that would make horror movie directors envious. There red stains and dismembered limbs all over the streets, with cars abandoned in the middle of the road.

One driver tried to get through the street with his car, but a group of the crazed people piled on top of his vehicle, not caring that they’d be crushed under the weight of it. It wasn’t long until the car crashed into a lamp post and from there, the driver stood no chance of surviving.

“Oh my god. They’re killing everyone.” Beth said with a quivering voice.

Just then, I saw a young girl crouching behind a trash container in a nearby alley. She peeked around curiously, waiting for the right time to get out. I tried to wave to her not to move from there, but she didn’t see me. She got out from her cover and started moving across the street in the direction of the army checkpoint. A loud shriek echoed in the street when one of the freaks saw her.

“Oh god, no…” Beth gasped.

The girl started running, but it was in vain. The horde was on top of her and before she even managed to let out a proper scream, she was dead. A minute later, when the horde of freaks dispersed, where the girl was before, was now a bloody, unrecognizable mess, with blood staining the ground.

By now, there were no more normal humans on the streets, so the horde stopped running and screaming and was instead walking around in seemingly random directions, twitching as they did so, producing gurgling and coughing noises. I heard Beth crying next to me and I hugged her.

“Beth. Hey, it’s okay, we’re safe here.” I put my hands on her shoulders and she wiped her tears.

She pulled away and took a few steps away from me.

“Don’t. You know I’m infected.” She said, turning away from me.

“Beth, it’s fine. If you’re infected, chances are I am, too. We won’t know for at least a few days though, because the incubation period is around two weeks. But if we stay here, we should be-“

“Aaron, did you see what’s out there?” Beth shot back in my direction and pointed to the edge of the rooftop, with a furious glare in her eye.

She put down her hand and said in a quivering voice:

“I’ll become like them soon. If I do-“

“Beth, you’re not gonna-“

“Just listen to me!” She raised her tone and pulled away once more when I tried to embrace her “Please, just listen. If I become like them, if I try to harm you or anyone else… you have to promise to kill me.”

I stared at her for a moment, unable to comprehend if she was serious or not. When her stern look persisted, I shook my head and said:

“What? Beth, I’m not gonna kill you. You’re not gonna be like them!”

“You heard what Stan said. This isn’t random. It isn’t normal. Whatever is happening to those people out there has something to do with the virus. So if I become like that, you have to promise me.”

She was serious. I opened my mouth to protest, but I knew whatever I said, she would find a way to beat my argument. She always did.

“Okay, Beth. Okay. I promise.” I said and put my hands on my hips.

That seemed to be enough for her, because in the next moment, she ran up to me and hugged me, as she started to cry. I consoled her, until a voice came from the middle of the rooftop.

“You guys okay up here?” Frank said, half inside the building “Stan is giving us some food, come on.”

He sank back inside the building and Beth and I followed him down. We were each given a can of beans and as meager as it sounded, Stan said we may have to reduce the rations to have them last longer. He estimated that the army should be here to clean up the mess within two days, but that we should be prepared just in case.

\*\*\*

Falling asleep on the first night was difficult. There was only one bed, which we gave to Elizabeth and her son Mark. The rest of us had to use jackets and other clothes from Stan’s room as bedding, which wasn’t nearly enough to soften the hard surface of the floor. On top of that, the constant screams, gunshots and other noises filled the air of the streets outside, putting most of us on edge. Marianne complained multiple times about the lack of food she’d received and the fact that the bed was given to the mother and the child, until the rest of us politely asked her to shut the fuck up.

The following day was uneventful, as we waited on the rooftop most of the day, expecting to see tanks and choppers roll in. The longer we waited, the more we lost hope, so to pass the time we talked with each other. Beth and Frank started coughing a little, which raised a concern with the other survivors. Marianne suggested we kick the two of them out, but that idea was quickly shut down by the rest of the group.

“Ma’am, if all you’ll be doing is complaining, then we may just toss *you* out from the roof.” Stan said, as he seemed to be in a crotchety mood all day.

“But they could infect the rest of us!” Marianne protested.

“Then you’re free to leave.” Stan said and that was the end of it.

\*\*\*

On day four, there was still no sign of the military and Beth started having a fever. We took Stan’s room to ourselves, where I tended to her. She spent two whole days in bed sleeping, as I stood by her side, checking every moment if her condition would worsen. On the morning of day six, I woke up to find her gone. The sheets of the bed were messily strewn on the side of the bed.

“Beth?” I called out and when I looked up, I saw the rooftop door open.

I climbed up and saw Beth standing at the edge of the roof, observing the street below.

“Beth! What are you doing? You should be in bed.” I approached her.

When she turned around, she smiled and said:

“I’m feeling fine today, it’s okay. I guess I managed to get over the virus after all.” She hugged me.

I sighed in relief, seeing her miraculously healthy. I didn’t expect her to recover so quickly, but I guessed all she needed was a good rest. I kissed her on the forehead and said:

“Oh thank god. See? I won’t have to kill you, after all.” We both chuckled “Well I’ll go grab us breakfast, be right back.”

I climbed down the ladder and as I reached for the door handle leading downstairs, I heard the sound of glass shattering coming from the shop.

“Guys?” I asked, as I opened the door.

As soon as I did open it, I heard something that could only be described as ravenous growling. A scream filled the shop and I rushed downstairs.

“What the hell is going on here?!” I asked as I burst inside.

I saw Stan standing behind the counter, point his gun at something. I looked at the direction he was pointing and saw Marianne laying on her back, while Frank sat on top of her, flailing his arms and shaking his head, sending spit flying everywhere. He was growling like a wild animal, as he tried hitting Marianne, while the woman held him back and whimpered.

Cindy, Elizabeth and Mark were huddled in a corner, crying. I went around the counter and said:

“Frank, what are you doing?! Stop!”

He jerked his head in my direction so violently, that hair fell partially over his eyes and before he turned his attention back to Marianne, I saw that his eyes were bloodshot, while he frothed at the mouth.

*Oh shit, he’s infected.* I thought to myself in the panic.

“Stan, shoot him!” I shouted, but Stan simply stood with his gun pointed, while his hands trembled furiously.

“Stan!” I repeated.

Frank finally managed to grab Marianne’s hands and he sunk his face in her neck. Marianne screamed and when Frank raised his head, a big chunk of flesh was in his mouth. Blood dripped from it and a pool was already starting to form around the woman’s neck. Without further hesitation, I ran up to Stan and grabbed the gun from his hand. I pointed it at Frank, who went down and took another bite, this time directly from Marianne’s throat. I squeezed the trigger and a loud bang resounded in the room.

Frank fell on top of Marianne and the growling instantly stopped.

“Oh my god.” I heard Beth say behind me, as the sounds of whimpering permeated the air.

I lowered my gun, suddenly realizing what I did.

“Oh, fuck.” I said “Oh, shit. I killed him.”

I don’t quite clearly remember it, but I know that the gun was taken from me and that I found myself embraced by Beth.

“You did the right thing, sweetie.” She said as she stroked my hair “He would have killed all of us.”

“I didn’t save her in time.” I said catatonically.

“She couldn’t be saved. It was too late.” Beth said.",t2_3k4um4cf,False,,0,False,COVID-19 is a lot worse than we were told [Part 2],[],r/nosleep,False,6,flair-series,0,False,t3_fgbpky,False,dark,,public,183,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Series,False,183,,True,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583864889.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffbhk2/covid19_is_a_lot_worse_than_we_were_told_part_1/""&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just conspiracy theories.” A young Asian man shouted loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he had the attention of everyone, he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I follow the news in China. They say that the government is hiding the actual numbers. We’re told there’s 30,000 infected people, but that’s not the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, what is the truth then?” A woman in her thirties who had a waitress’ uniform asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At least 150,000 have been infected in China alone, confirmed from reputable Chinese sources.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few scoffs and gasps in the room, as murmurs filled the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s true.” The old man at the counter said, as he loaded a magazine with bullets “I heard the same news. My son lives in Hong Kong, says the numbers are suspected to be way higher than what they’re told. They’re trying to keep it under wraps to prevent widespread panic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well what about these freaks outside? What the hell happened to them?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a loud bang on the shutter, making everyone in the room jump. We kept quiet for a moment in anticipation while the screams outside permeated the air, but luckily nothing else happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No idea.” The old man shrugged “All I do know is, we can’t get out now. Whoever is infected and I assume that’s most of the town by now, has probably gone batshit crazy. If we have any infected people here, they’ll probably become the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t know that.” I protested “We don’t know what went down with those people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A loud click permeated the room, as the man loaded the magazine into his handgun. He placed the gun on the counter and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Guess we’ll find out soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we no longer had cellphone reception, the old man suggested we stay put until the government decided to do something, as slim as those chances were. He stocked up on canned goods long before the outbreak, because he anticipated something like this would happen. He had enough to last the eight of us around a week, if we rationed it properly. He was willing to selflessly share it with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had time to kill, so we got to know each other. The old man’s name was Stan and he ran his shop alone. His kids lived in Seattle, so he wasn’t overly worried about them just yet. The Chinese guy’s name was Xiaotian, but since no one could pronounce it, he told us to call him Frank. The middle-aged woman who managed to get inside the shop before Beth and I was called Marianne and the waitress’ name was Cindy. Finally, there was a mother with her child and their names were Elizabeth and Mark. The two of them mostly spent time huddled in the corner, with her constantly having to re-explain to the kid why they couldn’t go home yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, by the way.” Stan said “This door behind me leads upstairs to my room. If anyone wants to get some sleep or fresh air, you can get to the rooftop here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beth and I exchanged glances, silently agreeing to go upstairs to observe the situation more clearly. We opened the door behind Stan and he frowned at us, before saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey. Don’t go doing any nasty things on my bed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ignored him and climbed the stairs. The door at the end of the stairwell opened into a small, dim room, crammed with a bed, closet, TV and other basic things that could fit inside. The room was messy, with the bed sheets half on the bed and half on the floor, clothes piled in various parts of the room and empty beer bottles on the nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Better than nothing, I guess.” I said and looked at the small latter in the corner of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was placed under the rooftop access door, which seemed to open upwards. I climbed up first and pushed the door open, immediately letting rays of grey light inside. I climbed out and immediately, the sounds of screams on the streets surrounding the building became louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come on, Beth.” I helped her up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around the roof and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I guess we’ll be safe here for a while, until the dust settles at least. Even if they break in, we can just close the hatch and we’ll be fine, yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” Beth said, almost in a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the edge of the roof and leaned on it, while Beth joined next to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jesus, look at that.” I said, not believing the sight in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were dozens of those freaks on the streets, just running in random directions, attacking any normal people that happened to find themselves in their way. The streets were already littered with countless dead bodies, mutilated in all sorts of unimaginable ways that would make horror movie directors envious. There red stains and dismembered limbs all over the streets, with cars abandoned in the middle of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One driver tried to get through the street with his car, but a group of the crazed people piled on top of his vehicle, not caring that they’d be crushed under the weight of it. It wasn’t long until the car crashed into a lamp post and from there, the driver stood no chance of surviving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god. They’re killing everyone.” Beth said with a quivering voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then, I saw a young girl crouching behind a trash container in a nearby alley. She peeked around curiously, waiting for the right time to get out. I tried to wave to her not to move from there, but she didn’t see me. She got out from her cover and started moving across the street in the direction of the army checkpoint. A loud shriek echoed in the street when one of the freaks saw her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh god, no…” Beth gasped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl started running, but it was in vain. The horde was on top of her and before she even managed to let out a proper scream, she was dead. A minute later, when the horde of freaks dispersed, where the girl was before, was now a bloody, unrecognizable mess, with blood staining the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, there were no more normal humans on the streets, so the horde stopped running and screaming and was instead walking around in seemingly random directions, twitching as they did so, producing gurgling and coughing noises. I heard Beth crying next to me and I hugged her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beth. Hey, it’s okay, we’re safe here.” I put my hands on her shoulders and she wiped her tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She pulled away and took a few steps away from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t. You know I’m infected.” She said, turning away from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beth, it’s fine. If you’re infected, chances are I am, too. We won’t know for at least a few days though, because the incubation period is around two weeks. But if we stay here, we should be-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aaron, did you see what’s out there?” Beth shot back in my direction and pointed to the edge of the rooftop, with a furious glare in her eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She put down her hand and said in a quivering voice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll become like them soon. If I do-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beth, you’re not gonna-“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just listen to me!” She raised her tone and pulled away once more when I tried to embrace her “Please, just listen. If I become like them, if I try to harm you or anyone else… you have to promise to kill me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at her for a moment, unable to comprehend if she was serious or not. When her stern look persisted, I shook my head and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? Beth, I’m not gonna kill you. You’re not gonna be like them!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You heard what Stan said. This isn’t random. It isn’t normal. Whatever is happening to those people out there has something to do with the virus. So if I become like that, you have to promise me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was serious. I opened my mouth to protest, but I knew whatever I said, she would find a way to beat my argument. She always did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Beth. Okay. I promise.” I said and put my hands on my hips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seemed to be enough for her, because in the next moment, she ran up to me and hugged me, as she started to cry. I consoled her, until a voice came from the middle of the rooftop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You guys okay up here?” Frank said, half inside the building “Stan is giving us some food, come on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sank back inside the building and Beth and I followed him down. We were each given a can of beans and as meager as it sounded, Stan said we may have to reduce the rations to have them last longer. He estimated that the army should be here to clean up the mess within two days, but that we should be prepared just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falling asleep on the first night was difficult. There was only one bed, which we gave to Elizabeth and her son Mark. The rest of us had to use jackets and other clothes from Stan’s room as bedding, which wasn’t nearly enough to soften the hard surface of the floor. On top of that, the constant screams, gunshots and other noises filled the air of the streets outside, putting most of us on edge. Marianne complained multiple times about the lack of food she’d received and the fact that the bed was given to the mother and the child, until the rest of us politely asked her to shut the fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day was uneventful, as we waited on the rooftop most of the day, expecting to see tanks and choppers roll in. The longer we waited, the more we lost hope, so to pass the time we talked with each other. Beth and Frank started coughing a little, which raised a concern with the other survivors. Marianne suggested we kick the two of them out, but that idea was quickly shut down by the rest of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ma’am, if all you’ll be doing is complaining, then we may just toss &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; out from the roof.” Stan said, as he seemed to be in a crotchety mood all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But they could infect the rest of us!” Marianne protested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then you’re free to leave.” Stan said and that was the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day four, there was still no sign of the military and Beth started having a fever. We took Stan’s room to ourselves, where I tended to her. She spent two whole days in bed sleeping, as I stood by her side, checking every moment if her condition would worsen. On the morning of day six, I woke up to find her gone. The sheets of the bed were messily strewn on the side of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beth?” I called out and when I looked up, I saw the rooftop door open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I climbed up and saw Beth standing at the edge of the roof, observing the street below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beth! What are you doing? You should be in bed.” I approached her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she turned around, she smiled and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m feeling fine today, it’s okay. I guess I managed to get over the virus after all.” She hugged me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed in relief, seeing her miraculously healthy. I didn’t expect her to recover so quickly, but I guessed all she needed was a good rest. I kissed her on the forehead and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh thank god. See? I won’t have to kill you, after all.” We both chuckled “Well I’ll go grab us breakfast, be right back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I climbed down the ladder and as I reached for the door handle leading downstairs, I heard the sound of glass shattering coming from the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Guys?” I asked, as I opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I did open it, I heard something that could only be described as ravenous growling. A scream filled the shop and I rushed downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell is going on here?!” I asked as I burst inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw Stan standing behind the counter, point his gun at something. I looked at the direction he was pointing and saw Marianne laying on her back, while Frank sat on top of her, flailing his arms and shaking his head, sending spit flying everywhere. He was growling like a wild animal, as he tried hitting Marianne, while the woman held him back and whimpered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cindy, Elizabeth and Mark were huddled in a corner, crying. I went around the counter and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Frank, what are you doing?! Stop!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He jerked his head in my direction so violently, that hair fell partially over his eyes and before he turned his attention back to Marianne, I saw that his eyes were bloodshot, while he frothed at the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh shit, he’s infected.&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself in the panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stan, shoot him!” I shouted, but Stan simply stood with his gun pointed, while his hands trembled furiously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stan!” I repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank finally managed to grab Marianne’s hands and he sunk his face in her neck. Marianne screamed and when Frank raised his head, a big chunk of flesh was in his mouth. Blood dripped from it and a pool was already starting to form around the woman’s neck. Without further hesitation, I ran up to Stan and grabbed the gun from his hand. I pointed it at Frank, who went down and took another bite, this time directly from Marianne’s throat. I squeezed the trigger and a loud bang resounded in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank fell on top of Marianne and the growling instantly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god.” I heard Beth say behind me, as the sounds of whimpering permeated the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lowered my gun, suddenly realizing what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, fuck.” I said “Oh, shit. I killed him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t quite clearly remember it, but I know that the gun was taken from me and that I found myself embraced by Beth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You did the right thing, sweetie.” She said as she stroked my hair “He would have killed all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t save her in time.” I said catatonically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She couldn’t be saved. It was too late.” Beth said.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep," 

When I was in college, I got the opportunity to join my genetic ecology professor on an excursion into the near-untouched forests of the Pacific Northwest one summer. I was the only underclassman on the trek, having proved myself valuable to Dr. Umban’s research the previous year as a freshman. I joined two juniors and two seniors on the ten hour drive out to the wilds of northeastern Washington state as our eccentric leader belted out seventies hits behind the wheel of a white stalker van. 

The sun was sinking low but not in danger of darkening by the time the van stopped on the soft grass before the trailhead. We were to spend one week camping out here, searching for early gymnosperms. Professor Umban had hypothesized there was a community of ancient plants growing in the region and had selected the five of us to help him track down and document species only described in the fossil records. Mike, one of the seniors, was out of the sliding door almost before the doc had even shifted to park. The rest of us followed suit quickly, eager to stretch our legs and feel some real sun on our skin, however briefly. Kate, the other senior, opened the passenger door and stretched all the way up and down, turning her face to the sun. Molly spilled out languidly after Mike, red hair flaming in the late afternoon light, followed shortly by Shannon with her headphones dangling haphazardly from her neck. I brought up the rear, marveling at the sheer remoteness of the location. Our decidedly simple route of up and back the stream in six days seemed much more daunting now that I was confronted with the wall of pines murmuring threateningly in the warm summer breeze.

After setting up camp near the entrance to the woods, we built a fire and reviewed our plan for the week. Our dinner was served from a barely utilitarian pot we had suspended above the flames and subsequently dumped a few cans of Campbell’s soups into.

“Alright,” Dr. Umban started, outdated map sprawled in front of him on the forest floor. “Tomorrow, we set out at first light and we hike it until we reach our first checkpoint here,” he pointed to a spot where two streams converged, just over ten kilometers north of where we were. “If we’re lucky,” he continued, “we should be able to reach it just after noon so we have the rest of the day to collect samples. We’ll split up into teams of two and we’ll rotate through the days. John,” he nodded at me, “you and I will be together the first day, with Kate and Mike making up team two and Molly and Shannon the third.” We all nodded and muttered our assent before we retired to our tents. Personally, I was thrilled to be sharing a tent with Mike, although I’d never let that on.  Huge biceps, handsome and earnest face, athletic, and still smart on top of all of that, but so “bro” that it was almost comical. He was a caricature of the buff, handsome jock, where I was a lean, rather awkward nerd. Still cute, but totally beneath his league, regardless of his preferences. Ah well, I sighed to myself, as I zipped in to my sleeping bag. 

“Night, man.” He said softly as he turned out the lantern. 

“Night, dude.” I smiled back in the dark.

We were up and packed by six the next morning. After a hurried breakfast of bacon and toast over the fire, we strapped up and hit the trail. The oppressive beauty of the woods beat us all into quiet. Even Mike, who had been quick enough with a joke or a witty observation on the trip up, seemed awed into respectful silence. Our bootsteps fell muffled on the thick bed of needles as we marched stolidly along the soft burbling river; the light filtered muted through the dark green canopy;  even the birds’ songs seemed distant and staid. I shuffled along the ancient riverbank and lost myself in the trees. 

I had never seen so many species of insects in my life. Sure, it was no tropical wonderland of color and frill, but the size of the beetles was far greater than I'd ever thought possible this far north of the equator. Nor had I seen dragonflies or grasshoppers of such varying kinds. Every few steps or so I'd catch a scuttle of a bright shell or a flicker of straight wings. At one point, about an hour in, a huge katydid landed on Shannon’s pixie-cut hair. She gave a brief screech before brushing it away furiously. We all laughed and the journey became distinctly more relaxed. 

“See these here, kids?” asked the doc as he bent down, “these ferns down at the forest floor here belong to a very old genus that branched off before seed plants were born.” We all crowded around the short leafy plant to check it out. Honestly, to me, it just looked like a regular old fern, although I was prepared to take professor Umban’s word for it. 

After another couple of hours of walking in alternating silence and field lecture from the doc, we finally reached the confluence of the rivers. We set about pitching our tents and building a fire pit before digging in hungrily to a lunch of salami sandwiches. As we ate, Dr. Umban outlined what we should be looking for.

“Okay folks,” he started, “we’re going to split up in to our teams and collect some specimens. Remember, we’re here looking for basal gymnosperms and anything older, so if it flowers, we don’t want it. Keep your searches low, although there may be some old mosses on some of the trees.” we all agreed and split up, myself tagging after the professor. 

The work was tedious. Since I was “young and healthy,” Dr. Umban had me do all of the collections from the forest floor. Here were some more ancient ferns, he pointed out, just on the cusp of developing seeds. And under those roots were some lycopods. At one point I dragged out some horse-tail looking thing from under a leaf and Dr. Umban got visibly excited. He gabbled about how old and beautiful it was as I brushed a few millipedes off the early fronds. He made sure I stowed it in a specimen jar before we continued our work.

We regrouped about four hours later, eager to see what everyone had found. The river burbled and the crickets chirped as we built the fire up again and shared our progress. Mike and Kate had found several examples of carpeting worts while the girls had found another horse-tail like plant. Dr. Umban was thrilled with our work and pulled out the map again.

“Based on our collections today, I think we want to continue upriver again tomorrow. Great work, kids, I think we’re on the right track. Tomorrow we’ll be switching up. Kate with me, Shannon with Mike, and Molly with John.” We all muttered assent once more, although Molly looked a little disappointed in having to settle for me. 

“Professor,” said Shannon, “How could some of these plants possibly be still extant? I thought most of these were wiped out during the permian extinction?”

“Very good, Shannon, the vast majority were,” was the response, “I believe, although I have little evidence to back it up, that there’s a stable, isolated ecosystem somewhere near the head of the river, probably underground, that was able to survive the extinction. I think the geography of the place is particularly conducive to caves and underground grottos: there was a fault line somewhere around here on Pangaea.” 

We spent the evening documenting our finds in our field journals and sharing another pot of soups around the fire. Kate had brought her ukulele and softly serenaded us around the fire with Jason Mraz and Israel Kamakawiwo’ole songs. Eventually the embers smouldered low and it was time to retire. We all packed in to our tents. I followed Mike in and zipped up. 

“Do you think we’re gonna find what the doc thinks is out here, dude?” he asked after we’d both stripped down and gotten into our sleeping bags.

“I really don’t know,” I responded heavily, “it seems like a huge longshot, but I guess stranger things have happened.”

“Yeah…” he trailed off, “you notice all the weird bugs out here too?”

“Shit, dude, I thought I was the only one, no one said anything earlier.”

“Yeah man it’s weird. I didn’t know they grew that big this far north. They’re kinda freaky.”

“No kidding,” I replied, “earlier I thought I saw a millipede the size of an earthworm, but that can’t possibly be right.”

“Yeah, probably just an actual earthworm. But they’re definitely big here.” We mused a little longer on the invertebrates we’d encountered until we’d freaked each other out enough. Mike eventually rolled over and shut the lantern off with his massive left arm, but not before flashing a wink and telling me sweet dreams with an adorable, impish grin. I croaked out a weak “same man” before sinking into inappropriate dreams about the boy I was sharing a tent with, glad for the darkness hiding my blush.  

The next day progressed much as the day before did. A relatively quiet hike in the morning gave way to setting up camp about ten more klicks upstream in a clearing nearby. Although the river seemed still, we could hear a distant flowing as though a waterfall were another few kilometers upstream.

“Hear that kids?” asked the doc, “that’s the spring at the head of the river. I think I was right! Hurry hurry, let’s collect all we can!”

We broke into our teams, with Molly and me heading toward the river. As we neared the banks I saw a group of beautifully iridescent dragonflies flitting among the reeds in the shallows. I motioned Molly to follow and she trailed behind me to the river’s edge. We collected specimens all afternoon and filled our jars with strange plants we’d never seen before. Just as we were about to head back to camp, Molly screamed. I rushed over to her to see what was wrong as she stood there terrified, red hair flashing danger. 

“What? What is it?” I panicked around her. 

“There’s a huge bug right on that leaf in front of me.” I looked and saw that she was very much not joking. A dragonfly with a wingspan of eight inches easily sunned itself on a rather stout-looking fern. 

“Should we jar it up?” I asked.

“Ewww! No! Plus, Dr. Umban says we’re here only to collect basal gymnosperms, so no animals.”

“Yeah, but this thing is huge! I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Yeah, well, doesn’t mean it’s anything new.”

I sullenly returned the specimen jar to my pack and dragged her by the elbow back towards camp. We were the last ones there, but only because it seemed the other teams had filled up their jars early. The doc was gabbling excitedly to Mike and Kate, who scrawled furiously in their notebooks. Shannon was organizing the rest of the jars as Molly and I strolled up. I overheard the wizened man talking about plants that hadn’t been seen except in the fossil record closely resembling some club mosses he and Kate had found growing near some pine trees. Molly and I added our jars to the collection that Shannon was messing with and I pulled up a scrap of earth to listen to the mad genius as he brandished what looked to be a young fern.

“... and you see, because the last time anything resembling a cycad this closely was seen this far north, the dinosaurs hadn’t even been here. These things were everywhere in the carboniferous period, about three hundred twenty some-odd million years ago. It was the age of plants. It’s where we get most of our oil from these days...hello John!” he smiled at me. “Anything old to report?” he chuckled. 

“Well, we found some really interesting woody-looking plants down by the river, but honestly I was more taken with the insect life.” I said kind of sheepishly. 

“Well, did you bottle any up?” asked Dr. Umban

“No,” I started, “Molly got a little freaked out.” I nodded back to where the ladies were fussing with the specimens, “But we did fill our jars. I found something else that looked old and weird...kind of scaly, I left it with Shannon. Molly found a huge horsetail, more of a small tree, really...”

“Excellent work!” the professor cried. There didn’t seem to be a thing that could dampen his spirits. “Alright team,” he started, now that we had all reunited, “tomorrow we’re going looking for that spring we hear up ahead. I want to get there early so we have all day to explore. Shannon, you’ll be with me, John with Mike, and Molly with Kate.” I tried very hard not to let my excitement show. Again we built a fire, though tonight we had more bacon and toast instead of soups. Again we retired to our tents, and tonight I'd noticed Mike had set his sleeping bag closer to mine, lantern on the other side of his bag instead of between us. My little overanalyzing heart beat furiously as we got down to our boxers and T-shirts. His knee bumped mine as we wrestled ourselves into our sleeping bags. 

“We gotta beat everyone tomorrow,” started Mike as he turned over to face me with a roguish smile on his face “need to bring your A-game, okay?”

“Oh don’t worry,” I responded, “we’re gonna collect the shit out of some specimens. Bitches won’t even know what bottled them up.” He laughed at that and lightly chucked me on the shoulder. My nerves exploded. 

“Alright man,” he said, turning over to get the lantern, “let’s get some sleep. Gotta be fresh to get the best shit.” I melted into my sleeping bag. 

I woke up before him, my arm unconsciously draped over his broad chest; I quickly pulled it back into my bag. We eventually rose and met the rest of the crew outside the tent. It didn’t take long for everyone to get alert, as we were all excited to find the spring. We set out just as the sun was breaking the treeline, following the crescendo of the rushing waters. After we had walked for an hour or so, hearing the rush of the elusive source growing ever louder, we found a great hill. The river curved up and over the giant mound, and the foot a small hole opened, presumably, to a cave. The sound was very clearly emanating from within.

“This is it, kids!” the professor said, almost bursting, “I'm willing to bet the spring, and this ecosystem I've hypothesized, is in this underground grotto. Let’s go get some specimens. And remember, if it tests as a new species when we get back, you get to name it!” 

Our intrepid six walked into that cave like we owned the damn place. We should have left well enough alone. As we passed through the entrance, the climate got quite a bit warmer and moister, and the path angled down sharply. We took careful, halting steps down into an increasingly muggy cavern until we arrived in the most bizarre and beautiful place of which I could never have dreamt.

The air was thick with fog, sunlight streaming through a distant hole in the top of the hill. As it parted to let us in, an outlandish beauty was revealed. Dragonflies the size of crows flew through the trees. Except they weren’t really trees, they were huge ferns and horsetails grown to gargantuan size, climbing thirty and forty meters high, supported by huge shingles of thick wood. Grasshoppers as big as my hand bounced through the dense underbrush of vascular leaves and green-grey mosses. And all around us we heard the constant rushing of the invisible spring. It was an ancient and mystical place. I breathed in reverently, filling my lungs with oxygen-rich primordial air and the thrill of discovery. 

“Holy shit.” Dr. Umban said under his breath, as a pair of protodonates flew past his head. “Just, holy shit!” he shouted. “This is it, this is fucking it, this is what I’ve always dreamed of!” he couldn’t contain himself. The five of us students stood there dumbly. It was the most marveolus, impossible thing that could ever occur to any of us. I was lost in the antediluvian wonder when the doc’s voice called us back to reality.

“Okay kids, real talk, bottle up everything you see. Split into your teams. First team to find the spring gets first credit on the paper. Ready? Go!”

Mike and I dashed off headfirst into the archaic jungle ahead, crashing over green leaves and furled fronds, looking for the unseen source with wild abandon. We were giddy with the reality of an actual untouched wonderland.

“Dude, I think it’s this way!” Mike hooted with delight. I kept pace with him as best I could until we reached a clearing with a small pool, although there wasn’t nearly enough water in it to generate the deafening rush all around us. We could faintly hear the crash of the other teams further off in the distance over the roar of the still hidden water. I stood there perplexed for a while.

“I guess this isn’t near big enough?” I said, gesturing to the pool, hoping my partner wouldn’t be too disappointed. “Mike? Hey, Mike!” I tapped him on the shoulder but he just pointed to something on the ground in front of him, frozen to the spot. 

It was the body of a giant millipede, easily two meters long, but halfway decayed. Part of its body hung limp over a rock, primitive innards spilled out towards the water. 

“Hey Professor!” I started to shout but Mike clamped a hand over my mouth and grabbed me tight so I couldn't move, dragging me back into the cover of the giant bushes.

As the professor and the ladies tramped through the foliage, Mike whispered tremulously in my ear, “Dude, I saw something huge moving in that pool. Whatever it was, I think it ate that millipede. We need to get the fuck out of here.”

When the rest of the party finally reached the clearing, they looked around for the two of us, bewildered at our absence. The professor, upon seeing the pool, cried out in delight and rushed over to it. I struggled against the muscles holding on to me, but Mike wouldn’t let go. I could feel him shaking in silent fear behind me.

The doc bent down to test the water and all at once the forest became silent. It was as if the spring had suddenly been shut off like a faucet, leaving the place completely still. Then it finally clicked for me. We hadn’t been hearing water rushing at all. It had been the scuttling and scurrying of sixes of millions of legs. We had trespassed in the domain of the insects and now they realized we were intruding. I could feel those myriad compound eyes trained on us, immobile and aware.

Dr. Umban started when the grot went still. He looked around in trepidation before returning his gaze to the water. The girls were all huddled together very closely, knowing something was wrong but not understanding the significance of the silence.

Without any warning, a massive, disgusting, feeler-tipped head exploded from the water followed by a snaking body banded in blue and red. I gazed in horror at the first dozen or so segments of an absolutely unthinkable water centipede undulating in the muggy, cloying atmosphere. The dangerously colored myriapod must have been at least fifteen meters long, if this was only the top bit above the water. It shot down and grabbed the professor by the waist in its jaws, slicing him neatly in half and spraying venom and blood all over the clearing as it scuttled horribly out of the water. Its body was longer and more grotesque than I could have possibly comprehended. Pair after pair of dark, red, feathery legs snaked up from the deep, waving and dripping horribly as they gained purchase on the soft, now bloody ground. Shannon screamed briefly as the centipede rounded on her, cutting off both her body and her shriek.

“Kate! Molly! Run!” Mike screamed as he released me and fled back toward the entrance. As I stumbled back I saw the hideous segments wrap themselves around Molly, crushing her feeble endoskeleton with its chitinous, serpentine body. As it waved its feelers in search of the other two bodies, I screamed for Mike. He stopped and ran back to grab me by the upper arm and drag me with him. I pulled at first, but then started to follow him as the centipede dragged its prey down into the depths. Kate flew past us and we all started hauling ass out of there.

That’s when the great rush from the spring of millions of jointed limbs resumed. Except this time it was far angrier and more determined than the gentle scurrying of casual insects we had heard before. I heard the beatings of uncountable wings prepare for flight and saw the ground begin to ripple. 

The arthropods were mad. 

\*\*\*

During the Carboniferous Period, roughly 350-300 million years ago, most of the common types of insects we know today, including beetles, cockroaches, dragonflies, grasshoppers, ants, bees, and flies, along with spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpions, were established in the fossil record. Many were giant by today’s standards. This stretch of time is called the Carboniferous Period because the land on our planet was covered with green vascular plants (subsequently supplying much of our carbon-based fuel today). The explosion of photosynthesis led to a massive increase in molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. Because of this, insects and other terrestrial arthropods, with their diffusion-limited, oxygen-based respiratory systems, grew to sizes of up to eight times those of their present-day counterparts. Moreover, with this evolutionary advantage, and a lack of seriously competing taxa, there must have been a similar explosion in the number of species, eventually being whittled down to the roughly 1.2 million arthropods we have described at present, comprising more than 80% of all known animal species.

\*\*\*

Mike, Kate, and I ran as hard as we could, sprinting madly on a shining, boiling carpet of writhing bugs. I felt wings beat around my ears as I covered the top of my head with my arms to keep the flying ones out of my face. I was crying and sprinting as hard as I could, knowing this would be my death. Up ahead I heard Kate scream as her foot found an unfortunate hole in the ground and she fell to the floor hard. By the time I had reached where she fell, she was little more than a human-shaped ripple of frantic legs and incensed wings. She was still trying to scream for help as I passed. Her mouth was frozen open in pain and terror as the heinous chitin invaded her body. I sped cravenly by, too terrified to open my mouth to cry out to her, lest I catch a throatful of wings. All I could do was pound my feet into the ever more slick ground in the hope I could reach the exit before I tripped or succumbed. 

Finally the ground turned steep under my feet and the invertebrates were behind me, though following closely. Mike was just in front of me, climbing the hill out to the forest of this day and age. I finally opened my mouth to breathe and then my foot fell wrong and I twisted my ankle. I went down, my arms outstretched, and my wrists took a bad tweak as they caught my weight. I looked back in panic to see the seething horde close on my trail. I screamed and began scrambling frantically on my elbows and knees. Mike hesitated, then turned back to get me. He scooped me up and slung me over his shoulder and ran us the rest of the way up to the light of modern day. He didn’t stop when we broke out of the hill, still pounding the dirt and putting distance between the ancient insects and us. When I looked back, I noticed the shining black floor had stopped about fifty meters from the hole into that cursed cavern. I pounded on Mike’s back and told him to stop. He did not. He finally fell from exhaustion after an hour or so, sending us both into a sprawling heap on the forest floor. We held onto each other and sobbed in fear until one of us could pull himself together.

It turned out I was able to calm down first. I slumped out of Mike’s embrace and up against a tree, sighing heavily, finally letting it sink in that we were alive. The image of that horrible centipede was burned into my mind. I couldn’t stop seeing it snatch the doc in half, blue and red bands twisting impossibly, antennae waving and sniffing out the fresh blood. Whenever I blinked, I saw Kate under that mass of living exoskeletons, face covered in anguish and rustling limbs, her skin alive with piecemeal movement. I let Mike have his time and he eventually recovered after a little bit. We stood up, my ankle hurt but not too badly injured, and he helped me limp back almost 20 kilometers to where we had parked the van. We broke in and futzed around with the wires under the steering wheel until we found some that started the ignition and drove the fuck away from that place in traumatized silence.

We of course told the police what happened, as we had to account for four people, including our sponsor, missing on a college-funded research outing. We were treated for bites the entomologists had never seen before and it was concluded that we had simply gotten lost and separated, with Mike and I being the only two to find our way out of the woods. There was a search but it turned up nothing. Even after giving the police detailed instructions on how to find the wicked cavern, there was no trace of it. They offered to let us come on the search but neither of us was stepping foot in those damned woods again. 

The centipede still haunts my dreams. I’ll often wake up in a cold sweat next to Mike these days, feeling thousands of little, jointed limbs on my skin after I’ve watched the prehistoric monster snatch up my beautiful husband. It’s very hard to return to sleep when I remember some of those bugs that made it out probably survived due to genetic mutations that made them adaptable to lower-oxygen environments. And those genes are now back in the evolutionary pool, waiting to take over the earth once again.",t2_6o6z0,False,,0,False,Arthropoda,[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgkt5n,False,dark,,public,26,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,26,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583902187.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in college, I got the opportunity to join my genetic ecology professor on an excursion into the near-untouched forests of the Pacific Northwest one summer. I was the only underclassman on the trek, having proved myself valuable to Dr. Umban’s research the previous year as a freshman. I joined two juniors and two seniors on the ten hour drive out to the wilds of northeastern Washington state as our eccentric leader belted out seventies hits behind the wheel of a white stalker van. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was sinking low but not in danger of darkening by the time the van stopped on the soft grass before the trailhead. We were to spend one week camping out here, searching for early gymnosperms. Professor Umban had hypothesized there was a community of ancient plants growing in the region and had selected the five of us to help him track down and document species only described in the fossil records. Mike, one of the seniors, was out of the sliding door almost before the doc had even shifted to park. The rest of us followed suit quickly, eager to stretch our legs and feel some real sun on our skin, however briefly. Kate, the other senior, opened the passenger door and stretched all the way up and down, turning her face to the sun. Molly spilled out languidly after Mike, red hair flaming in the late afternoon light, followed shortly by Shannon with her headphones dangling haphazardly from her neck. I brought up the rear, marveling at the sheer remoteness of the location. Our decidedly simple route of up and back the stream in six days seemed much more daunting now that I was confronted with the wall of pines murmuring threateningly in the warm summer breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting up camp near the entrance to the woods, we built a fire and reviewed our plan for the week. Our dinner was served from a barely utilitarian pot we had suspended above the flames and subsequently dumped a few cans of Campbell’s soups into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright,” Dr. Umban started, outdated map sprawled in front of him on the forest floor. “Tomorrow, we set out at first light and we hike it until we reach our first checkpoint here,” he pointed to a spot where two streams converged, just over ten kilometers north of where we were. “If we’re lucky,” he continued, “we should be able to reach it just after noon so we have the rest of the day to collect samples. We’ll split up into teams of two and we’ll rotate through the days. John,” he nodded at me, “you and I will be together the first day, with Kate and Mike making up team two and Molly and Shannon the third.” We all nodded and muttered our assent before we retired to our tents. Personally, I was thrilled to be sharing a tent with Mike, although I’d never let that on.  Huge biceps, handsome and earnest face, athletic, and still smart on top of all of that, but so “bro” that it was almost comical. He was a caricature of the buff, handsome jock, where I was a lean, rather awkward nerd. Still cute, but totally beneath his league, regardless of his preferences. Ah well, I sighed to myself, as I zipped in to my sleeping bag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Night, man.” He said softly as he turned out the lantern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Night, dude.” I smiled back in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were up and packed by six the next morning. After a hurried breakfast of bacon and toast over the fire, we strapped up and hit the trail. The oppressive beauty of the woods beat us all into quiet. Even Mike, who had been quick enough with a joke or a witty observation on the trip up, seemed awed into respectful silence. Our bootsteps fell muffled on the thick bed of needles as we marched stolidly along the soft burbling river; the light filtered muted through the dark green canopy;  even the birds’ songs seemed distant and staid. I shuffled along the ancient riverbank and lost myself in the trees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never seen so many species of insects in my life. Sure, it was no tropical wonderland of color and frill, but the size of the beetles was far greater than I&amp;#39;d ever thought possible this far north of the equator. Nor had I seen dragonflies or grasshoppers of such varying kinds. Every few steps or so I&amp;#39;d catch a scuttle of a bright shell or a flicker of straight wings. At one point, about an hour in, a huge katydid landed on Shannon’s pixie-cut hair. She gave a brief screech before brushing it away furiously. We all laughed and the journey became distinctly more relaxed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“See these here, kids?” asked the doc as he bent down, “these ferns down at the forest floor here belong to a very old genus that branched off before seed plants were born.” We all crowded around the short leafy plant to check it out. Honestly, to me, it just looked like a regular old fern, although I was prepared to take professor Umban’s word for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another couple of hours of walking in alternating silence and field lecture from the doc, we finally reached the confluence of the rivers. We set about pitching our tents and building a fire pit before digging in hungrily to a lunch of salami sandwiches. As we ate, Dr. Umban outlined what we should be looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay folks,” he started, “we’re going to split up in to our teams and collect some specimens. Remember, we’re here looking for basal gymnosperms and anything older, so if it flowers, we don’t want it. Keep your searches low, although there may be some old mosses on some of the trees.” we all agreed and split up, myself tagging after the professor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work was tedious. Since I was “young and healthy,” Dr. Umban had me do all of the collections from the forest floor. Here were some more ancient ferns, he pointed out, just on the cusp of developing seeds. And under those roots were some lycopods. At one point I dragged out some horse-tail looking thing from under a leaf and Dr. Umban got visibly excited. He gabbled about how old and beautiful it was as I brushed a few millipedes off the early fronds. He made sure I stowed it in a specimen jar before we continued our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We regrouped about four hours later, eager to see what everyone had found. The river burbled and the crickets chirped as we built the fire up again and shared our progress. Mike and Kate had found several examples of carpeting worts while the girls had found another horse-tail like plant. Dr. Umban was thrilled with our work and pulled out the map again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Based on our collections today, I think we want to continue upriver again tomorrow. Great work, kids, I think we’re on the right track. Tomorrow we’ll be switching up. Kate with me, Shannon with Mike, and Molly with John.” We all muttered assent once more, although Molly looked a little disappointed in having to settle for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Professor,” said Shannon, “How could some of these plants possibly be still extant? I thought most of these were wiped out during the permian extinction?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Very good, Shannon, the vast majority were,” was the response, “I believe, although I have little evidence to back it up, that there’s a stable, isolated ecosystem somewhere near the head of the river, probably underground, that was able to survive the extinction. I think the geography of the place is particularly conducive to caves and underground grottos: there was a fault line somewhere around here on Pangaea.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the evening documenting our finds in our field journals and sharing another pot of soups around the fire. Kate had brought her ukulele and softly serenaded us around the fire with Jason Mraz and Israel Kamakawiwo’ole songs. Eventually the embers smouldered low and it was time to retire. We all packed in to our tents. I followed Mike in and zipped up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you think we’re gonna find what the doc thinks is out here, dude?” he asked after we’d both stripped down and gotten into our sleeping bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I really don’t know,” I responded heavily, “it seems like a huge longshot, but I guess stranger things have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah…” he trailed off, “you notice all the weird bugs out here too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shit, dude, I thought I was the only one, no one said anything earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah man it’s weird. I didn’t know they grew that big this far north. They’re kinda freaky.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No kidding,” I replied, “earlier I thought I saw a millipede the size of an earthworm, but that can’t possibly be right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, probably just an actual earthworm. But they’re definitely big here.” We mused a little longer on the invertebrates we’d encountered until we’d freaked each other out enough. Mike eventually rolled over and shut the lantern off with his massive left arm, but not before flashing a wink and telling me sweet dreams with an adorable, impish grin. I croaked out a weak “same man” before sinking into inappropriate dreams about the boy I was sharing a tent with, glad for the darkness hiding my blush.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day progressed much as the day before did. A relatively quiet hike in the morning gave way to setting up camp about ten more klicks upstream in a clearing nearby. Although the river seemed still, we could hear a distant flowing as though a waterfall were another few kilometers upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hear that kids?” asked the doc, “that’s the spring at the head of the river. I think I was right! Hurry hurry, let’s collect all we can!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We broke into our teams, with Molly and me heading toward the river. As we neared the banks I saw a group of beautifully iridescent dragonflies flitting among the reeds in the shallows. I motioned Molly to follow and she trailed behind me to the river’s edge. We collected specimens all afternoon and filled our jars with strange plants we’d never seen before. Just as we were about to head back to camp, Molly screamed. I rushed over to her to see what was wrong as she stood there terrified, red hair flashing danger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? What is it?” I panicked around her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a huge bug right on that leaf in front of me.” I looked and saw that she was very much not joking. A dragonfly with a wingspan of eight inches easily sunned itself on a rather stout-looking fern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Should we jar it up?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ewww! No! Plus, Dr. Umban says we’re here only to collect basal gymnosperms, so no animals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but this thing is huge! I’ve never seen anything like it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, well, doesn’t mean it’s anything new.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sullenly returned the specimen jar to my pack and dragged her by the elbow back towards camp. We were the last ones there, but only because it seemed the other teams had filled up their jars early. The doc was gabbling excitedly to Mike and Kate, who scrawled furiously in their notebooks. Shannon was organizing the rest of the jars as Molly and I strolled up. I overheard the wizened man talking about plants that hadn’t been seen except in the fossil record closely resembling some club mosses he and Kate had found growing near some pine trees. Molly and I added our jars to the collection that Shannon was messing with and I pulled up a scrap of earth to listen to the mad genius as he brandished what looked to be a young fern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“... and you see, because the last time anything resembling a cycad this closely was seen this far north, the dinosaurs hadn’t even been here. These things were everywhere in the carboniferous period, about three hundred twenty some-odd million years ago. It was the age of plants. It’s where we get most of our oil from these days...hello John!” he smiled at me. “Anything old to report?” he chuckled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, we found some really interesting woody-looking plants down by the river, but honestly I was more taken with the insect life.” I said kind of sheepishly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, did you bottle any up?” asked Dr. Umban&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” I started, “Molly got a little freaked out.” I nodded back to where the ladies were fussing with the specimens, “But we did fill our jars. I found something else that looked old and weird...kind of scaly, I left it with Shannon. Molly found a huge horsetail, more of a small tree, really...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Excellent work!” the professor cried. There didn’t seem to be a thing that could dampen his spirits. “Alright team,” he started, now that we had all reunited, “tomorrow we’re going looking for that spring we hear up ahead. I want to get there early so we have all day to explore. Shannon, you’ll be with me, John with Mike, and Molly with Kate.” I tried very hard not to let my excitement show. Again we built a fire, though tonight we had more bacon and toast instead of soups. Again we retired to our tents, and tonight I&amp;#39;d noticed Mike had set his sleeping bag closer to mine, lantern on the other side of his bag instead of between us. My little overanalyzing heart beat furiously as we got down to our boxers and T-shirts. His knee bumped mine as we wrestled ourselves into our sleeping bags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We gotta beat everyone tomorrow,” started Mike as he turned over to face me with a roguish smile on his face “need to bring your A-game, okay?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh don’t worry,” I responded, “we’re gonna collect the shit out of some specimens. Bitches won’t even know what bottled them up.” He laughed at that and lightly chucked me on the shoulder. My nerves exploded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright man,” he said, turning over to get the lantern, “let’s get some sleep. Gotta be fresh to get the best shit.” I melted into my sleeping bag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up before him, my arm unconsciously draped over his broad chest; I quickly pulled it back into my bag. We eventually rose and met the rest of the crew outside the tent. It didn’t take long for everyone to get alert, as we were all excited to find the spring. We set out just as the sun was breaking the treeline, following the crescendo of the rushing waters. After we had walked for an hour or so, hearing the rush of the elusive source growing ever louder, we found a great hill. The river curved up and over the giant mound, and the foot a small hole opened, presumably, to a cave. The sound was very clearly emanating from within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is it, kids!” the professor said, almost bursting, “I&amp;#39;m willing to bet the spring, and this ecosystem I&amp;#39;ve hypothesized, is in this underground grotto. Let’s go get some specimens. And remember, if it tests as a new species when we get back, you get to name it!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our intrepid six walked into that cave like we owned the damn place. We should have left well enough alone. As we passed through the entrance, the climate got quite a bit warmer and moister, and the path angled down sharply. We took careful, halting steps down into an increasingly muggy cavern until we arrived in the most bizarre and beautiful place of which I could never have dreamt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air was thick with fog, sunlight streaming through a distant hole in the top of the hill. As it parted to let us in, an outlandish beauty was revealed. Dragonflies the size of crows flew through the trees. Except they weren’t really trees, they were huge ferns and horsetails grown to gargantuan size, climbing thirty and forty meters high, supported by huge shingles of thick wood. Grasshoppers as big as my hand bounced through the dense underbrush of vascular leaves and green-grey mosses. And all around us we heard the constant rushing of the invisible spring. It was an ancient and mystical place. I breathed in reverently, filling my lungs with oxygen-rich primordial air and the thrill of discovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit.” Dr. Umban said under his breath, as a pair of protodonates flew past his head. “Just, holy shit!” he shouted. “This is it, this is fucking it, this is what I’ve always dreamed of!” he couldn’t contain himself. The five of us students stood there dumbly. It was the most marveolus, impossible thing that could ever occur to any of us. I was lost in the antediluvian wonder when the doc’s voice called us back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay kids, real talk, bottle up everything you see. Split into your teams. First team to find the spring gets first credit on the paper. Ready? Go!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike and I dashed off headfirst into the archaic jungle ahead, crashing over green leaves and furled fronds, looking for the unseen source with wild abandon. We were giddy with the reality of an actual untouched wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dude, I think it’s this way!” Mike hooted with delight. I kept pace with him as best I could until we reached a clearing with a small pool, although there wasn’t nearly enough water in it to generate the deafening rush all around us. We could faintly hear the crash of the other teams further off in the distance over the roar of the still hidden water. I stood there perplexed for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I guess this isn’t near big enough?” I said, gesturing to the pool, hoping my partner wouldn’t be too disappointed. “Mike? Hey, Mike!” I tapped him on the shoulder but he just pointed to something on the ground in front of him, frozen to the spot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the body of a giant millipede, easily two meters long, but halfway decayed. Part of its body hung limp over a rock, primitive innards spilled out towards the water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey Professor!” I started to shout but Mike clamped a hand over my mouth and grabbed me tight so I couldn&amp;#39;t move, dragging me back into the cover of the giant bushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the professor and the ladies tramped through the foliage, Mike whispered tremulously in my ear, “Dude, I saw something huge moving in that pool. Whatever it was, I think it ate that millipede. We need to get the fuck out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the rest of the party finally reached the clearing, they looked around for the two of us, bewildered at our absence. The professor, upon seeing the pool, cried out in delight and rushed over to it. I struggled against the muscles holding on to me, but Mike wouldn’t let go. I could feel him shaking in silent fear behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doc bent down to test the water and all at once the forest became silent. It was as if the spring had suddenly been shut off like a faucet, leaving the place completely still. Then it finally clicked for me. We hadn’t been hearing water rushing at all. It had been the scuttling and scurrying of sixes of millions of legs. We had trespassed in the domain of the insects and now they realized we were intruding. I could feel those myriad compound eyes trained on us, immobile and aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Umban started when the grot went still. He looked around in trepidation before returning his gaze to the water. The girls were all huddled together very closely, knowing something was wrong but not understanding the significance of the silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without any warning, a massive, disgusting, feeler-tipped head exploded from the water followed by a snaking body banded in blue and red. I gazed in horror at the first dozen or so segments of an absolutely unthinkable water centipede undulating in the muggy, cloying atmosphere. The dangerously colored myriapod must have been at least fifteen meters long, if this was only the top bit above the water. It shot down and grabbed the professor by the waist in its jaws, slicing him neatly in half and spraying venom and blood all over the clearing as it scuttled horribly out of the water. Its body was longer and more grotesque than I could have possibly comprehended. Pair after pair of dark, red, feathery legs snaked up from the deep, waving and dripping horribly as they gained purchase on the soft, now bloody ground. Shannon screamed briefly as the centipede rounded on her, cutting off both her body and her shriek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kate! Molly! Run!” Mike screamed as he released me and fled back toward the entrance. As I stumbled back I saw the hideous segments wrap themselves around Molly, crushing her feeble endoskeleton with its chitinous, serpentine body. As it waved its feelers in search of the other two bodies, I screamed for Mike. He stopped and ran back to grab me by the upper arm and drag me with him. I pulled at first, but then started to follow him as the centipede dragged its prey down into the depths. Kate flew past us and we all started hauling ass out of there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when the great rush from the spring of millions of jointed limbs resumed. Except this time it was far angrier and more determined than the gentle scurrying of casual insects we had heard before. I heard the beatings of uncountable wings prepare for flight and saw the ground begin to ripple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arthropods were mad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Carboniferous Period, roughly 350-300 million years ago, most of the common types of insects we know today, including beetles, cockroaches, dragonflies, grasshoppers, ants, bees, and flies, along with spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpions, were established in the fossil record. Many were giant by today’s standards. This stretch of time is called the Carboniferous Period because the land on our planet was covered with green vascular plants (subsequently supplying much of our carbon-based fuel today). The explosion of photosynthesis led to a massive increase in molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. Because of this, insects and other terrestrial arthropods, with their diffusion-limited, oxygen-based respiratory systems, grew to sizes of up to eight times those of their present-day counterparts. Moreover, with this evolutionary advantage, and a lack of seriously competing taxa, there must have been a similar explosion in the number of species, eventually being whittled down to the roughly 1.2 million arthropods we have described at present, comprising more than 80% of all known animal species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike, Kate, and I ran as hard as we could, sprinting madly on a shining, boiling carpet of writhing bugs. I felt wings beat around my ears as I covered the top of my head with my arms to keep the flying ones out of my face. I was crying and sprinting as hard as I could, knowing this would be my death. Up ahead I heard Kate scream as her foot found an unfortunate hole in the ground and she fell to the floor hard. By the time I had reached where she fell, she was little more than a human-shaped ripple of frantic legs and incensed wings. She was still trying to scream for help as I passed. Her mouth was frozen open in pain and terror as the heinous chitin invaded her body. I sped cravenly by, too terrified to open my mouth to cry out to her, lest I catch a throatful of wings. All I could do was pound my feet into the ever more slick ground in the hope I could reach the exit before I tripped or succumbed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the ground turned steep under my feet and the invertebrates were behind me, though following closely. Mike was just in front of me, climbing the hill out to the forest of this day and age. I finally opened my mouth to breathe and then my foot fell wrong and I twisted my ankle. I went down, my arms outstretched, and my wrists took a bad tweak as they caught my weight. I looked back in panic to see the seething horde close on my trail. I screamed and began scrambling frantically on my elbows and knees. Mike hesitated, then turned back to get me. He scooped me up and slung me over his shoulder and ran us the rest of the way up to the light of modern day. He didn’t stop when we broke out of the hill, still pounding the dirt and putting distance between the ancient insects and us. When I looked back, I noticed the shining black floor had stopped about fifty meters from the hole into that cursed cavern. I pounded on Mike’s back and told him to stop. He did not. He finally fell from exhaustion after an hour or so, sending us both into a sprawling heap on the forest floor. We held onto each other and sobbed in fear until one of us could pull himself together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out I was able to calm down first. I slumped out of Mike’s embrace and up against a tree, sighing heavily, finally letting it sink in that we were alive. The image of that horrible centipede was burned into my mind. I couldn’t stop seeing it snatch the doc in half, blue and red bands twisting impossibly, antennae waving and sniffing out the fresh blood. Whenever I blinked, I saw Kate under that mass of living exoskeletons, face covered in anguish and rustling limbs, her skin alive with piecemeal movement. I let Mike have his time and he eventually recovered after a little bit. We stood up, my ankle hurt but not too badly injured, and he helped me limp back almost 20 kilometers to where we had parked the van. We broke in and futzed around with the wires under the steering wheel until we found some that started the ignition and drove the fuck away from that place in traumatized silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We of course told the police what happened, as we had to account for four people, including our sponsor, missing on a college-funded research outing. We were treated for bites the entomologists had never seen before and it was concluded that we had simply gotten lost and separated, with Mike and I being the only two to find our way out of the woods. There was a search but it turned up nothing. Even after giving the police detailed instructions on how to find the wicked cavern, there was no trace of it. They offered to let us come on the search but neither of us was stepping foot in those damned woods again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centipede still haunts my dreams. I’ll often wake up in a cold sweat next to Mike these days, feeling thousands of little, jointed limbs on my skin after I’ve watched the prehistoric monster snatch up my beautiful husband. It’s very hard to return to sleep when I remember some of those bugs that made it out probably survived due to genetic mutations that made them adaptable to lower-oxygen environments. And those genes are now back in the evolutionary pool, waiting to take over the earth once again.&lt;/p&gt;

It's about 6 AM, I look tired as all hell and I'm sitting at a table without a drink or meal, just typing on my phone. Under normal circumstances this would be weird to do, but if you know what happened to me, you'll probably understand, so, I'll tell you guys, even though I know you'll all call me crazy, I just need to get this off my chest

It had been a normal Saturday morning, when John called. John, or Johnny as everyone used to call him, had been my best friend since High School. Back in those days we definitely made some teachers reconsider their career choices, those were the good times. Even after graduation, we stayed in contact. This wasn't hard, because he had 'accidentally' moved in to a house not even half a mile away from my home, but, I'm getting off track here, so anyway, he called me. He told me he had bought a cabin in the woods a few miles north of our town and he wanted to invite me for a (in his words) 'guy night'. After some consideration, I agreed. ""By the way,"" he said as he hung up, ""we're taking your car!"". I laughed, but understood why. His Charger is a cool car, but if you want to get to a cabin in the middle of the woods, an X5 is a better choice.

That afternoon we were loading up the car, when Sarah arrived. Sarah has been my girlfriend for about 5 months now, and even though I love her, she does say some weird stuff sometimes, you could almost classify her as a conspiracy theorist. ""What are you guys doing?"" She asked. Before I could answer, John interrupted me. ""We're going to go to my brand new cabin!"" ""Without me? At least tell me where you guys are going!"" Sarah said. ""Oh, just up north."" I replied. Suddenly, Sarah's face turned serious. ""Oh no, oh no no no. I've heard terrible things about there. A lot of people die there because of some strange cryptid."" She said. ""Ha! I'll defeat it with my bare hands!"" John said, sarcastic and overconfident as always, as he jumped into my car. Sarah turned to me. ""Promise me you'll be careful."" She said. ""Don't worry, I will, besides, aren't all those deaths caused by wolves or something?"" I said. ""Officially, yes,but I don't trust that, anyways, stay safe, bye."" Sarah said. ""Yep, no problem!"" I said as jumped into my car. We waved as I started the engine and we drove away.

The interstate turned into a local road. The local road turned into a trail, and the trail turned into something that can only be described as to lines on some grass. After that nightmare of a 'road' we arrived, and it was beautiful. There was a large lake in front of the cabin, surrounded by woods. It looked absolutely awesome. The water was perfectly still, the birds soared over the trees and some deer looked up from their drink as we arrived. ""This looks amazing dude!"" I said. ""I know right, it's gonna be a great sight to wake up to!"" John replied. After having looked at the scenery for a while, we went inside. The cabin had a gicantic TV, luxurious looking furniture, and (best of all) two separate bedrooms. On the walls were several posters of Football players, Nascar drivers and some girls with, let's say, not too much clothes on. ""Don't let Sarah see that!"" John joked. We laughed for a while, and soon after started messing around. We found out several things, such as that microwaving crisps wasn't a great idea, that it takes Domino's an hour to deliver to the middle of the woods and that reheated pizza tastes way better than you would expect. After dinner we started messing around with the TV. Constantly switching between random shows before eventually settling down on (and laughing to death at) a random low-budget kid's film. Eventually we had tired each other out and went to bed. I was so tired that I just fell asleep the second I touched my bed.

I woke up around 1 AM to some weird noises. I heard growling and footsteps, like an entire pack of wolves was just outside the door. I tried to ignore it and go back to sleep, when I saw John's door open. ""What the fuck is he doing?"" I mumbled. John got out of his bedroom and started walking towards the door. I tried to tell him to stop, but he wouldn't listen. It looked like he was in trance as he walked towards the door. I quickly hid away as he opened the door, because I fully expected the wolves to charge into the cabin.

It stayed quiet for too long. No screaming, now howling, just the sounds of the lake. I can't explain why I looked. Maybe it was morbid curiosity to see if John was actually dead, or maybe I was looking to see if he was okay, and it was all imagination. Whatever it was, I looked. There was John's body, completely ripped open, and standing above him, was a creature that was as big as the cabin itself. It looked like someone took those cliche werewolves from cartoons, and made them ten times scarier. It's mouth was surrounded by blood, its teeth were at least 40 centimeters tall, and its claws were sharper than most combat knives. Then, it looked up. It noticed me standing in the doorway, and started making its way towards me. I just stood there, as vulnerable as a kitten. There were no weapons in the cabin, I was completely defenseless. I just closed my eyes and braced myself for its claw to grab me.

My eyes were shut for half a minute. After that, I couldn't handle the pressure and opened them. There the creature stood. Dead silent, looking at the thickest part of the woods. Then, everything happened at once. An actual pack of wolves appeared out the woods, sprinting towards the creature. They were growling and showing of their teeth at the creature. Suddenly, the creature began to panic. It started shaking and looked around itself, looking for an escape route. The second it found one the creature sprinted away. I still don't know why, it looked like it could tackle the wolves easily. A few wolves chased it down, while the rest of the pack stayed in front of the cabin. This was my chance. I climbed out of my bedroom window, silently waked to my car and hightailed it out of there.

I drove for nearly 5 hours, only stopping once to take a pee, and even then, I was always paranoidly looking around me to make sure I was safe. It was only when the sun started to rise that I even dared to stop longer than 5 minutes. And that's where I am now, in a rest stop, just frantically typing. For this of you wondering I will call the police when I get home. I'll tell some bullshit story about him going missing on a walk, and no, I'm not gonna tell Sarah the truth, I just don't want her to tell all here conspiracy friends.

,nosleep,"Was it my fault? Could I have stopped it if I did something differently? Do I deserve to live when so many others had to die? These thoughts torment me ever since that day.  What I'm about to share... well, officially it never happened. I'm probably going to die tomorrow and I don't care, but I want to leave the truth behind. It's strange how clear my memories are even after all this time.

It started like most of my days during high school. Rushing to the bus stop, already being late, thinking about an excuse. Unfortunately, our first class was Spanish, and my teacher Mrs. Ariely loved to make a spectacle out of everyone who was not on time. You always had to explain to her why you were late, in Spanish! The first few times, she accepted the sentence I memorized for these occasions: Me quedé dormido (I overslept). But I had a feeling she is not going to let me off the hook so easily this time, and ask me why I couldn't wake up. I would have gladly told her I spent the whole night reading a horror novel, but that was beyond my Spanish language skills. So I opened the dictionary once I was on the bus, hoping I would be able to talk my way out of it. I had no idea Spanish would be the least of my concerns, and that I would never touch another horror book ever again after that day. 

I was lost in the dictionary when someone put me in a headlock from behind. I started struggling and gasping for air, but unexpectedly, my attacker's grip loosened, and I heard familiar laughter and a smug yet friendly voice from behind. 

""Isn't it a bit late to start studying for Spanish? Man, you are such a nerd, you were so deep in your book you didn't even notice when I got on the bus.""

""Fuck you, Sylvester. I just don't want to get humiliated in front of the whole class,"" I chuckled. 

""I am not in the mood to give an explanation to Mrs. Ariely either. Let's ditch the first class and drink something instead!"" 

""Well, I don't know. We already skipped some classes last week,"" I argued, but already knew how that's going to end.

Thirty minutes later, we were in a pub and Sylvester was in the middle of persuading the bartender to serve us. You could always count on him to get some alcohol since he looked much older than he really was. He was bald and had a large scar on his scalp. He proudly told everyone that he got it during Krav Maga training when they were practicing knife techniques, but I was convinced he was bullshiting. I avoided him at first because he seemed like the textbook example of bad influence. He was on the verge of failing most of his classes every year, and his only extracurricular activity was getting wasted. Despite all this, he had a big heart, and once I got to know him better, he became one of my best friends. 

Spanish was already over when we entered our classroom. We smelled of alcohol and tobacco, so our classmates turned to us and started laughing. None of them had a problem with our careless attitude. Well, maybe one of them did, I could see Greta at her desk closing her book to give me a dark and disappointed look. 

She was a childhood friend of mine. To be honest, she was my only friend in elementary school. We shared the same fascination with horror stories, but for her, it was a bit more serious. A horror novel was enough to entertain me she, on the other hand, was studying ancient tomes about witchcraft, blood magic, and rituals. Her appearance passed perfectly to her interests. She was pale and only wore dark clothes, even had a black cat called Shadow. Most of the class thought she was insane, but I never had a problem with her unique style.

What bothered me was that she never even tried to socialize with anyone else. I slowly made new friends, but she simply couldn't. Because of that, I interacted with her less and less each year. By the end of elementary school, we barely spoke. I knew she despised me for this and thought that my new high school friends (especially Sylvester) are assholes. I felt bad for her, but I thought that's how life is, friends come and go.

I was already used to her looking at me with sad or frustrated eyes when  I was having fun with someone. However, to my surprise, on that day, she came to my desk and started lecturing me, ""Why did you even bother to come to school!? You should have stayed at that dirty pub. That would have been better for everyone."" 

She has never been this direct, so it caught me off guard. I was just looking at her with a surprised face, but Sylvester, who was sitting next to me, already had a comeback, ""Hey Greta, did you find a spell in one of your stupid books that made you confident? Good for you! Now you should sit back and search for another one that can help with that ugly mug of yours! I am not kidding, please get out of our faces, otherwise, we might throw up.""

She stood there for a few seconds without saying anything, then suddenly turned around, ran back to her desk, threw her books in her bag, and stormed out of the classroom. I stood up to go after her, but Sylvester grabbed my arm. ""Do you really want to go after that crazy witch? She might have been your friend long ago, but—"" 

""Fuck off Sylvester, you overdid it this time,"" I said as I pushed him away and ran out. I saw her entering a classroom at the end of the hallway, so I followed her. The room was empty aside from the two of us. Her backpack was on the ground. She next to it curled up in a ball and weeping.  I noticed a familiar black creature crawling out of her bag. It took me a second to realize that it was her cat, Shadow. It started purring and rubbing its head against Greta to comfort her.

Seeing her like that made me realize how lonely she must have been, and memories of our childhood flashed before my eyes. The happy moments we spent playing with Shadow. The summer nights when we were sky gazing in her garden. The countless hours reading together and discussing books. 

I wanted to say something to let her know how sorry I was, but I couldn't find the right words. So instead of saying anything, I offered her a tissue, but she pushed my hand away. 

""I hate you! You ignored me for years, and never stood up for me. It was the same today. You just sat there in silence while Sylvester was saying those horrible things. I thought we had something special, but you are just like the rest,"" she took a deep breath, wiped the tears from her eyes and continued, ""it's too late now anyway, all of you will get what you deserve, I will—"" She couldn't finish because I pulled her to myself and hugged her while tears started flowing down my cheeks too. She returned my hug and a weak smile appeared on her face.

I was ashamed of myself and wanted to be close to her again. We probably would have stayed on the ground, hugging each other, sharing our feelings as we used to if the door didn't slam open. Greta's smile disappeared immediately when she saw the two guys entering the room. It was Sylvester and the biggest asshole in the whole class, Martin. Of course, he started mocking us immediately. 

""I can't believe my eyes!  Why didn't you tell us you are in love with that disgusting hag? Let me take a picture! The whole class is going to love this!""

""Shut up, Martin! You don't know anything about us! And you Sylvester, why did you follow me, and why did you bring this idiot with you?!""

But before he could answer, Greta interrupted, ""I almost changed my mind. I wanted to show mercy, but you reminded me how much I hate all of you. Thank you, Martin,"" and with those words, she stood up and pulled out a black dagger from her bag. 

I was frozen in place while my two classmates stepped back with confusion in their eyes. I was half-expecting her to charge at them with the dagger. But instead, she cut her own palm and closed her eyes. Blood started pouring out of the wound and quickly formed a puddle at her feet. Martin started making distasteful suicide jokes, but the words stuck in his throat when strange red mist began to emanate from the blood, and the disgusting smell of decay filled the room. 

I was trying to make sense of this strange phenomenon when Greta abruptly picked up Shadow, put the dagger to its throat, and slit it open. Blood was gushing all over her as she let go of the cat and the dagger.  Her eyes remained closed during this, but I swear I could see a faint red glow behind her eyelids. The poor animal trashed around for a while after hitting the ground, splashing blood everywhere while the mist got thicker.

The situation was so shocking I wasn't able to move or say anything. I just stood there with Martin and Sylvester in silence. The mist started to slowly engulf Shadow while its hair fell out, and small holes appeared all over its body. The blood lifted from the ground and poured into these newly-opened holes. Shadow was twitching violently as the red liquid filled it. 

I am not sure what happened next because the red mist filled the entire room. I heard disturbing noises and growls coming from Greta's direction, but I couldn't see anything. Suddenly, the whole building started to tremble, and the windows slammed shut. I was afraid the whole building is going to collapse, but after a minute, the shaking stopped, the mist cleared, and an eerie silence filled the room. 

Nothing was blocking my view anymore and I could see a terrifying monster standing next to Greta. It resembled a hairless bear that was almost as tall as me. It was standing on four legs and had a long tail ending in a stinger. The creature only had a few patches of hair covering its wrinkly, rotting, black skin and the eyes of a cat, but the iris around the black pupil was dark red. I was looking at something impossible, yet I understood that it was real, it was too awful not to be. My voice trembled as I asked what I already knew.  ""This monster... is it Shadow?"" 

Greta looked at me with a sad smile and said one final word, ""Goodbye.""

I had thousands of questions. How is this possible? Could Greta really have done this? Is she going to let me die? The beast started growling and advancing towards me. The stench of rotting flesh became unbearable as it got closer.  I probably would have died there if Martin didn't start to scream. That captured Shadow's attention, and it pounced at him. Martin tried to dodge the attack but wasn't fast enough, the monster's long claws tore off his right leg with just one slash. He collapsed and kept screaming, but he was silenced almost immediately by the creature's tail. The stinger at the end went right through Martin's skull, leaving a gaping hole. I was still frozen in place when I heard Sylvester shouting, ""Run, you idiot! We have to get out!"" 

That finally snapped me out of my shock, and I bolted after him to the door, but a sudden sharp pain made me stumble at the exit. I fell to the ground yelling with pain and saw Shadow pulling its blood-covered tail out from my lower leg and preparing for another strike, this time aiming at my face. I rolled to my side and felt the wind as the stinger passed my head and hit the ground next to me. I tried to get up, but there was no time, the beast was already readying itself to jump on me.

I laid there full of dread when Sylvester grabbed me from behind and pulled me out of the room right before Shadow pounced. I did my best to ignore the pain as my friend helped me to my feet and started dragging me through the hallway. As we ran for our lives, doors opened left and right, and our schoolmates poured out from their classrooms. They were probably looking for the source of the wild uproar.

We just kept running without looking back, but once we were close to the staircase leading to the ground floor, I risked a glance back. The beast was still mustering the students with its evil, red eyes. There were a few quiet seconds, but then all hell broke loose. Shadow jumped from person to person, ripping off limbs with its claws.

I quickened my steps as much as I could to get out of the building and as far away from that monster as possible. I was incredibly relieved when I finally stumbled down the stairs and saw the double door leading outside. But this feeling quickly faded when we tried to open it. ""What the hell?! They never close this door,"" I shrieked.

""Calm down, it won't be my first time vandalizing something,""  Sylvester said while he started pushing against the door.

I wanted to help him, but I couldn't even stand without my friend's support. The adrenalin rush that kept me on my feet while we were running through the hallway was gone, and the pain became unbearable. I looked down and realized that my whole lower right leg was soaked in blood. To stop the bleeding, I took off my sweatshirt and used it as a bandage substitute.

Meanwhile, Sylvester kept charging at the door, but to no avail. So he stopped and turned his attention to the tall narrow glass panes in the door. ""We can fit through there, just a second,"" he said and started kicking the glass. 

It looked thin and weak, but no matter how much force Sylvester put into his kicks, not even a small crack appeared on the glass. He realized this and started panicking, banging his whole body against the door. My vision became blurry as I watched my friend struggle, and the hopelessness of our situation struck me.

""Stop Sylvester! This is not normal, the door shouldn't be closed, and the glass should have broken after your first kick. I think Greta sealed us in somehow, that's why the whole building shook during that ritual or whatever it was... But there must be something we can do. I don't wanna die. Please help me up."" 

Sylvester inspected my wound, and his face turned pale. ""Your leg doesn't look good. We need to treat it properly, there should be a first aid kit in every classroom. Not that it matters if that beast catches us... How could she make such a monster out of a cat anyway, this whole situation is impossible. Do you know what happened or how we could escape? Greta was your friend after all.""

""I have no idea how she did that. I know she is into strange books about magic, but I'd never imagined— ""

I was interrupted by the cries of our schoolmates. They were running down the staircase in panic. Despite their loud screams, I could hear Shadow's growls coming from behind them. Sylvester helped me to my foot again, and we started moving towards the classroom on the far side of the hallway to hide. I could already hear the sounds of carnage not far behind when we entered. All the students were cowering under their desks. We tried to close the door immediately after we rushed in, but someone jumped out from behind it and swung a chair towards us. 

The chair stopped before reaching us and to my surprise, the one who was holding it was our Spanish teacher, Mrs. Ariely. It was hard to believe that in the morning she was my biggest fear.

""Oh my God, sorry! I almost hit you! ...Wait a moment. I thought you two are not in school today,"" there was an awkward moment of silence before she continued, ""nevermind, do you know what's going on out there? I tried calling the other teachers and the police too, but nobody here has a signal on their phone."" 

""Sorry for ditching class this morning teacher,""  I am not sure why I said that. Probably because of the blood loss because I collapsed and lost consciousness right after.

When I came to my senses, the first thing I heard was Mrs. Ariely and Sylvester arguing. My friend waving around with his hands vehemently while trying to prove his point. I was lying on the ground at the back of the class. There was an open first aid kit next to me. I looked at my leg and saw it was properly bandaged. It still hurt like hell, but the bleeding has finally stopped. 

""How long was I out? What happened?"" I asked as loud as I could to catch the attention of my friend. 

Sylvester turned to me with a relieved smile. ""Only a few minutes. Man, I am glad you are back, tell Mrs. Ariely about the monster, she doesn't believe me.""

Our teacher's face was red, and she was shouting, ""This is not funny at all! I know you two always like to fool around, but this is not the time for jokes!  Do you realize you could have died without first aid?! You are lucky I knew how to treat such a deep wound. But I swear if you do not tell me the truth I will— ""

""Teacher, this might make you believe,"" Sylvester interrupted as he picked up a chair and started smashing one of the classroom windows with it. The chair bounced back without leaving a scratch.  Miss. Ariely stopped talking and stepped closer to my friend with confusion in her eyes.

I stood up and joined the conversation to help Sylvester prove that we were not fooling around. ""I know it sounds unbelievable, and I am not the most trustworthy student either, but what he said is true. We are trapped in here with a monster. However, there might be something we can do,"" I said as I approached the window.

There was a busy street next to our school, so I  started shouting and waving frantically to the people who were passing by. Soon the whole class joined. Some students were trying to force the windows open, others kept banging on it and shouting, but no matter how hard we tried, no one from the outside could see or hear us. The thought that we were invisible to the outside world and no help is coming horrified me. ""It's no use, there is no escape,"" I said as my last glimmer of hope extinguished. 

""No! There must be a way out! After me, students!"" Mrs. Ariely shouted with fear in her voice as she made her way to the door. But before she could open it, Shadow's tail came bursting through, sending wooden splinters everywhere and impaling our teacher. The beast slowly walked in, and the smell of rotting flesh filled the room. Mrs. Ariely was still on its tail, gasping for air and coughing up blood. Greta also entered the classroom, walking casually behind her monstrous pet. A sinister grin appeared on her face the moment our eyes met. Shadow swung its tail propelling our teacher's body through the air. It landed with a loud thud right next to me. To my horror, she was still alive, groaning with pain as blood kept gushing from her mouth. My legs started to shake uncontrollably, and I fell to my knees as Shadow began to massacre the students one by one. 

The monster took its time with each student. Poking them full of holes, slowly eating them alive, slashing their limbs off, squeezing them to death. Meanwhile, Greta stood in the corner, watching the slaughter with cold empty eyes. She looked at me from time to time and smirked when she saw how horrified I was. By the end, blood was dripping from all of the walls, and the floor was full of gory red pools. Sylvester and I were the only ones still alive.  My friend was shaking next to me during the massacre. But to my surprise, he seemed to have regained control of his body as Shadow started advancing towards him.  

He pulled out a black dagger from his pocket and started running towards Greta while shouting. ""You disgusting witch! I won't let you feed me to your fucking monster!"" But Shadow jumped between them and struck Sylvester with its tail. The attack penetrated his right arm, but as soon as it hit him, he used the weapon in his other hand and severed the stinger from the end of the monster's tail. Shadow hissed as it jumped back. Greta's wicked smile disappeared, and she looked at Sylvester in disbelief.

""Surprised bitch?! A normal knife shouldn't be able to cut your little pet so easily, right? Take a look at my weapon, isn't it familiar?  I didn't think it would be so useful, but now I am glad I picked it up. Now you will fucking pay for what you've done!"" said Sylvester while walking menacingly towards Greta.

Shadow attacked him again, using its claws this time. My friend stepped back to avoid the strike and threw the dagger with surprising accuracy into the monster's left eye. It let out a painful cry but continued attacking. My friend evaded the beast's claws again, reached for the dagger stuck in its eye, gave it a good twist, and pulled it out.

Instead of striking the monster again, he charged at Greta. Shadow was still recovering, so it couldn't interfere. Greta started backing up, but soon hit the wall and had nowhere to run. Sylvester lunged towards her, ready to kill. The blade was getting closer and closer, but when it almost reached her throat, there was a loud bang, and the dagger shattered into a thousand pieces. Sylvester was looking at the remains of the weapon with confusion when Shadow's large claws tore his head off from behind. It happened so fast he didn't even have time to scream. 

Greta realized that she was no longer in danger, and the evil grin returned to her face. She slowly walked to the severed head of my friend, picked it up, and started speaking to it. ""I  have underestimated you. Thought you were just a stupid asshole, but I must admit I was wrong. You were bold enough to pick up my dagger during the ritual. You maybe even could have killed poor Shadow if you didn't try to attack me. But hurting a Witch with her own sacrificial weapon is not possible. Shame you had to learn it this way,"" she let go of Sylvester's head and turned to me, ""now let's finish this.""

I was still kneeling on the ground and didn't even try to stand up, I accepted my fate. Shadow was right in front of me, its left eye was closed, and blood kept dripping from it. But its rage-filled right eye was looking straight at me. As its mouth opened, the stench of blood and decay almost made me pass out. I closed my eyes and prepared for the pain I was about to experience. But instead, a small hand dragged me up to my feet. I was sure Greta decided to kill me personally, so I kept my eyes closed, but instead of a killing blow, I felt her cold lips pressed against mine as she put her hand on my back and pulled me closer. It was not a kiss of passion nor love, it was dominant and violent, but I could not resist it... or rather, I didn't dare to resist.

She pushed me back to the ground when she was done. I noticed that the terrible smell has vanished, and I couldn't hear Shadow's heavy breathing either, so I opened my eyes. Greta was standing in front of me. But next to her, there was only a small black cat, instead of the monster. Its left eye and the end of its tail was still missing, and its remaining eye was dark red, but otherwise, it was the same small, black cat I knew from my childhood. Greta looked at me one last time with a satisfied smile, then she picked up Shadow, turned around, and walked out of the classroom. My vision started to become blurry as I watched her leave. Once I could no longer hear her footsteps everything faded into darkness... 

The next morning I woke in a hospital bed. After a few moments of peace, the memories of the massacre came flooding back. I started to shiver and scream uncontrollably. I was sure Greta and Shadow would come bursting through the door any second. I lost touch with reality, and it stayed like that for many months. I only had brief moments of clarity here and there. I can remember how Police officers told me that I was the only survivor.  I can remember that they were asking me about the murders, and I also remember that they never believed anything I said. 

Back then, I didn't care about it. Most of the time, I was in a world of nightmares anyway. I relived that day again and again, and each time I saw all of my blood-covered, mangled schoolmates vividly. I couldn't eat or sleep properly and considered taking my own life almost every day. I might have never recovered if my parents didn't spend a fortune on psychiatrists. Of course, they never believed me either, but at least they could help me get my life somewhat together. 

Tomorrow it will be exactly ten years since Greta killed everyone in my school. I  still ask myself the same questions every day. Why did all those people have to die? Why was I left alive? From the outside, it would seem that I have a normal life, steady job, and great friends, but to tell the truth, I haven't felt alive since that day. Like I told you in the beginning, I am writing this because I'm probably going to die tomorrow, but I don't care I must go, I need answers. Last week I found a note in my mailbox with no address or name on it, but I knew exactly who sent it:

*If you want to know what happened all those years ago, come to our school on the tenth anniversary of my blood ritual.  I will be waiting for you in the classroom where it started. The school is abandoned now so nobody will disturb us.*  

*You belong to me.*",t2_503zufb0,False,,0,False,"I might die tomorrow, but I will leave the truth about my school behind",[],r/nosleep,False,6,,0,False,t3_fgi720,False,dark,,public,43,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,43,,False,,False,,[],{},['writing'],True,,1583892697.0,text,6,,,text,self.nosleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it my fault? Could I have stopped it if I did something differently? Do I deserve to live when so many others had to die? These thoughts torment me ever since that day.  What I&amp;#39;m about to share... well, officially it never happened. I&amp;#39;m probably going to die tomorrow and I don&amp;#39;t care, but I want to leave the truth behind. It&amp;#39;s strange how clear my memories are even after all this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started like most of my days during high school. Rushing to the bus stop, already being late, thinking about an excuse. Unfortunately, our first class was Spanish, and my teacher Mrs. Ariely loved to make a spectacle out of everyone who was not on time. You always had to explain to her why you were late, in Spanish! The first few times, she accepted the sentence I memorized for these occasions: Me quedé dormido (I overslept). But I had a feeling she is not going to let me off the hook so easily this time, and ask me why I couldn&amp;#39;t wake up. I would have gladly told her I spent the whole night reading a horror novel, but that was beyond my Spanish language skills. So I opened the dictionary once I was on the bus, hoping I would be able to talk my way out of it. I had no idea Spanish would be the least of my concerns, and that I would never touch another horror book ever again after that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lost in the dictionary when someone put me in a headlock from behind. I started struggling and gasping for air, but unexpectedly, my attacker&amp;#39;s grip loosened, and I heard familiar laughter and a smug yet friendly voice from behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t it a bit late to start studying for Spanish? Man, you are such a nerd, you were so deep in your book you didn&amp;#39;t even notice when I got on the bus.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck you, Sylvester. I just don&amp;#39;t want to get humiliated in front of the whole class,&amp;quot; I chuckled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am not in the mood to give an explanation to Mrs. Ariely either. Let&amp;#39;s ditch the first class and drink something instead!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, I don&amp;#39;t know. We already skipped some classes last week,&amp;quot; I argued, but already knew how that&amp;#39;s going to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes later, we were in a pub and Sylvester was in the middle of persuading the bartender to serve us. You could always count on him to get some alcohol since he looked much older than he really was. He was bald and had a large scar on his scalp. He proudly told everyone that he got it during Krav Maga training when they were practicing knife techniques, but I was convinced he was bullshiting. I avoided him at first because he seemed like the textbook example of bad influence. He was on the verge of failing most of his classes every year, and his only extracurricular activity was getting wasted. Despite all this, he had a big heart, and once I got to know him better, he became one of my best friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanish was already over when we entered our classroom. We smelled of alcohol and tobacco, so our classmates turned to us and started laughing. None of them had a problem with our careless attitude. Well, maybe one of them did, I could see Greta at her desk closing her book to give me a dark and disappointed look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was a childhood friend of mine. To be honest, she was my only friend in elementary school. We shared the same fascination with horror stories, but for her, it was a bit more serious. A horror novel was enough to entertain me she, on the other hand, was studying ancient tomes about witchcraft, blood magic, and rituals. Her appearance passed perfectly to her interests. She was pale and only wore dark clothes, even had a black cat called Shadow. Most of the class thought she was insane, but I never had a problem with her unique style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What bothered me was that she never even tried to socialize with anyone else. I slowly made new friends, but she simply couldn&amp;#39;t. Because of that, I interacted with her less and less each year. By the end of elementary school, we barely spoke. I knew she despised me for this and thought that my new high school friends (especially Sylvester) are assholes. I felt bad for her, but I thought that&amp;#39;s how life is, friends come and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already used to her looking at me with sad or frustrated eyes when  I was having fun with someone. However, to my surprise, on that day, she came to my desk and started lecturing me, &amp;quot;Why did you even bother to come to school!? You should have stayed at that dirty pub. That would have been better for everyone.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has never been this direct, so it caught me off guard. I was just looking at her with a surprised face, but Sylvester, who was sitting next to me, already had a comeback, &amp;quot;Hey Greta, did you find a spell in one of your stupid books that made you confident? Good for you! Now you should sit back and search for another one that can help with that ugly mug of yours! I am not kidding, please get out of our faces, otherwise, we might throw up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She stood there for a few seconds without saying anything, then suddenly turned around, ran back to her desk, threw her books in her bag, and stormed out of the classroom. I stood up to go after her, but Sylvester grabbed my arm. &amp;quot;Do you really want to go after that crazy witch? She might have been your friend long ago, but—&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck off Sylvester, you overdid it this time,&amp;quot; I said as I pushed him away and ran out. I saw her entering a classroom at the end of the hallway, so I followed her. The room was empty aside from the two of us. Her backpack was on the ground. She next to it curled up in a ball and weeping.  I noticed a familiar black creature crawling out of her bag. It took me a second to realize that it was her cat, Shadow. It started purring and rubbing its head against Greta to comfort her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing her like that made me realize how lonely she must have been, and memories of our childhood flashed before my eyes. The happy moments we spent playing with Shadow. The summer nights when we were sky gazing in her garden. The countless hours reading together and discussing books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to say something to let her know how sorry I was, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find the right words. So instead of saying anything, I offered her a tissue, but she pushed my hand away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hate you! You ignored me for years, and never stood up for me. It was the same today. You just sat there in silence while Sylvester was saying those horrible things. I thought we had something special, but you are just like the rest,&amp;quot; she took a deep breath, wiped the tears from her eyes and continued, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s too late now anyway, all of you will get what you deserve, I will—&amp;quot; She couldn&amp;#39;t finish because I pulled her to myself and hugged her while tears started flowing down my cheeks too. She returned my hug and a weak smile appeared on her face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was ashamed of myself and wanted to be close to her again. We probably would have stayed on the ground, hugging each other, sharing our feelings as we used to if the door didn&amp;#39;t slam open. Greta&amp;#39;s smile disappeared immediately when she saw the two guys entering the room. It was Sylvester and the biggest asshole in the whole class, Martin. Of course, he started mocking us immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe my eyes!  Why didn&amp;#39;t you tell us you are in love with that disgusting hag? Let me take a picture! The whole class is going to love this!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shut up, Martin! You don&amp;#39;t know anything about us! And you Sylvester, why did you follow me, and why did you bring this idiot with you?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before he could answer, Greta interrupted, &amp;quot;I almost changed my mind. I wanted to show mercy, but you reminded me how much I hate all of you. Thank you, Martin,&amp;quot; and with those words, she stood up and pulled out a black dagger from her bag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was frozen in place while my two classmates stepped back with confusion in their eyes. I was half-expecting her to charge at them with the dagger. But instead, she cut her own palm and closed her eyes. Blood started pouring out of the wound and quickly formed a puddle at her feet. Martin started making distasteful suicide jokes, but the words stuck in his throat when strange red mist began to emanate from the blood, and the disgusting smell of decay filled the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to make sense of this strange phenomenon when Greta abruptly picked up Shadow, put the dagger to its throat, and slit it open. Blood was gushing all over her as she let go of the cat and the dagger.  Her eyes remained closed during this, but I swear I could see a faint red glow behind her eyelids. The poor animal trashed around for a while after hitting the ground, splashing blood everywhere while the mist got thicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation was so shocking I wasn&amp;#39;t able to move or say anything. I just stood there with Martin and Sylvester in silence. The mist started to slowly engulf Shadow while its hair fell out, and small holes appeared all over its body. The blood lifted from the ground and poured into these newly-opened holes. Shadow was twitching violently as the red liquid filled it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what happened next because the red mist filled the entire room. I heard disturbing noises and growls coming from Greta&amp;#39;s direction, but I couldn&amp;#39;t see anything. Suddenly, the whole building started to tremble, and the windows slammed shut. I was afraid the whole building is going to collapse, but after a minute, the shaking stopped, the mist cleared, and an eerie silence filled the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing was blocking my view anymore and I could see a terrifying monster standing next to Greta. It resembled a hairless bear that was almost as tall as me. It was standing on four legs and had a long tail ending in a stinger. The creature only had a few patches of hair covering its wrinkly, rotting, black skin and the eyes of a cat, but the iris around the black pupil was dark red. I was looking at something impossible, yet I understood that it was real, it was too awful not to be. My voice trembled as I asked what I already knew.  &amp;quot;This monster... is it Shadow?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greta looked at me with a sad smile and said one final word, &amp;quot;Goodbye.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had thousands of questions. How is this possible? Could Greta really have done this? Is she going to let me die? The beast started growling and advancing towards me. The stench of rotting flesh became unbearable as it got closer.  I probably would have died there if Martin didn&amp;#39;t start to scream. That captured Shadow&amp;#39;s attention, and it pounced at him. Martin tried to dodge the attack but wasn&amp;#39;t fast enough, the monster&amp;#39;s long claws tore off his right leg with just one slash. He collapsed and kept screaming, but he was silenced almost immediately by the creature&amp;#39;s tail. The stinger at the end went right through Martin&amp;#39;s skull, leaving a gaping hole. I was still frozen in place when I heard Sylvester shouting, &amp;quot;Run, you idiot! We have to get out!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That finally snapped me out of my shock, and I bolted after him to the door, but a sudden sharp pain made me stumble at the exit. I fell to the ground yelling with pain and saw Shadow pulling its blood-covered tail out from my lower leg and preparing for another strike, this time aiming at my face. I rolled to my side and felt the wind as the stinger passed my head and hit the ground next to me. I tried to get up, but there was no time, the beast was already readying itself to jump on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laid there full of dread when Sylvester grabbed me from behind and pulled me out of the room right before Shadow pounced. I did my best to ignore the pain as my friend helped me to my feet and started dragging me through the hallway. As we ran for our lives, doors opened left and right, and our schoolmates poured out from their classrooms. They were probably looking for the source of the wild uproar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just kept running without looking back, but once we were close to the staircase leading to the ground floor, I risked a glance back. The beast was still mustering the students with its evil, red eyes. There were a few quiet seconds, but then all hell broke loose. Shadow jumped from person to person, ripping off limbs with its claws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickened my steps as much as I could to get out of the building and as far away from that monster as possible. I was incredibly relieved when I finally stumbled down the stairs and saw the double door leading outside. But this feeling quickly faded when we tried to open it. &amp;quot;What the hell?! They never close this door,&amp;quot; I shrieked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Calm down, it won&amp;#39;t be my first time vandalizing something,&amp;quot;  Sylvester said while he started pushing against the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to help him, but I couldn&amp;#39;t even stand without my friend&amp;#39;s support. The adrenalin rush that kept me on my feet while we were running through the hallway was gone, and the pain became unbearable. I looked down and realized that my whole lower right leg was soaked in blood. To stop the bleeding, I took off my sweatshirt and used it as a bandage substitute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sylvester kept charging at the door, but to no avail. So he stopped and turned his attention to the tall narrow glass panes in the door. &amp;quot;We can fit through there, just a second,&amp;quot; he said and started kicking the glass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looked thin and weak, but no matter how much force Sylvester put into his kicks, not even a small crack appeared on the glass. He realized this and started panicking, banging his whole body against the door. My vision became blurry as I watched my friend struggle, and the hopelessness of our situation struck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop Sylvester! This is not normal, the door shouldn&amp;#39;t be closed, and the glass should have broken after your first kick. I think Greta sealed us in somehow, that&amp;#39;s why the whole building shook during that ritual or whatever it was... But there must be something we can do. I don&amp;#39;t wanna die. Please help me up.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylvester inspected my wound, and his face turned pale. &amp;quot;Your leg doesn&amp;#39;t look good. We need to treat it properly, there should be a first aid kit in every classroom. Not that it matters if that beast catches us... How could she make such a monster out of a cat anyway, this whole situation is impossible. Do you know what happened or how we could escape? Greta was your friend after all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have no idea how she did that. I know she is into strange books about magic, but I&amp;#39;d never imagined— &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interrupted by the cries of our schoolmates. They were running down the staircase in panic. Despite their loud screams, I could hear Shadow&amp;#39;s growls coming from behind them. Sylvester helped me to my foot again, and we started moving towards the classroom on the far side of the hallway to hide. I could already hear the sounds of carnage not far behind when we entered. All the students were cowering under their desks. We tried to close the door immediately after we rushed in, but someone jumped out from behind it and swung a chair towards us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chair stopped before reaching us and to my surprise, the one who was holding it was our Spanish teacher, Mrs. Ariely. It was hard to believe that in the morning she was my biggest fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my God, sorry! I almost hit you! ...Wait a moment. I thought you two are not in school today,&amp;quot; there was an awkward moment of silence before she continued, &amp;quot;nevermind, do you know what&amp;#39;s going on out there? I tried calling the other teachers and the police too, but nobody here has a signal on their phone.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry for ditching class this morning teacher,&amp;quot;  I am not sure why I said that. Probably because of the blood loss because I collapsed and lost consciousness right after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to my senses, the first thing I heard was Mrs. Ariely and Sylvester arguing. My friend waving around with his hands vehemently while trying to prove his point. I was lying on the ground at the back of the class. There was an open first aid kit next to me. I looked at my leg and saw it was properly bandaged. It still hurt like hell, but the bleeding has finally stopped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How long was I out? What happened?&amp;quot; I asked as loud as I could to catch the attention of my friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylvester turned to me with a relieved smile. &amp;quot;Only a few minutes. Man, I am glad you are back, tell Mrs. Ariely about the monster, she doesn&amp;#39;t believe me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our teacher&amp;#39;s face was red, and she was shouting, &amp;quot;This is not funny at all! I know you two always like to fool around, but this is not the time for jokes!  Do you realize you could have died without first aid?! You are lucky I knew how to treat such a deep wound. But I swear if you do not tell me the truth I will— &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Teacher, this might make you believe,&amp;quot; Sylvester interrupted as he picked up a chair and started smashing one of the classroom windows with it. The chair bounced back without leaving a scratch.  Miss. Ariely stopped talking and stepped closer to my friend with confusion in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood up and joined the conversation to help Sylvester prove that we were not fooling around. &amp;quot;I know it sounds unbelievable, and I am not the most trustworthy student either, but what he said is true. We are trapped in here with a monster. However, there might be something we can do,&amp;quot; I said as I approached the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a busy street next to our school, so I  started shouting and waving frantically to the people who were passing by. Soon the whole class joined. Some students were trying to force the windows open, others kept banging on it and shouting, but no matter how hard we tried, no one from the outside could see or hear us. The thought that we were invisible to the outside world and no help is coming horrified me. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s no use, there is no escape,&amp;quot; I said as my last glimmer of hope extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No! There must be a way out! After me, students!&amp;quot; Mrs. Ariely shouted with fear in her voice as she made her way to the door. But before she could open it, Shadow&amp;#39;s tail came bursting through, sending wooden splinters everywhere and impaling our teacher. The beast slowly walked in, and the smell of rotting flesh filled the room. Mrs. Ariely was still on its tail, gasping for air and coughing up blood. Greta also entered the classroom, walking casually behind her monstrous pet. A sinister grin appeared on her face the moment our eyes met. Shadow swung its tail propelling our teacher&amp;#39;s body through the air. It landed with a loud thud right next to me. To my horror, she was still alive, groaning with pain as blood kept gushing from her mouth. My legs started to shake uncontrollably, and I fell to my knees as Shadow began to massacre the students one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monster took its time with each student. Poking them full of holes, slowly eating them alive, slashing their limbs off, squeezing them to death. Meanwhile, Greta stood in the corner, watching the slaughter with cold empty eyes. She looked at me from time to time and smirked when she saw how horrified I was. By the end, blood was dripping from all of the walls, and the floor was full of gory red pools. Sylvester and I were the only ones still alive.  My friend was shaking next to me during the massacre. But to my surprise, he seemed to have regained control of his body as Shadow started advancing towards him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pulled out a black dagger from his pocket and started running towards Greta while shouting. &amp;quot;You disgusting witch! I won&amp;#39;t let you feed me to your fucking monster!&amp;quot; But Shadow jumped between them and struck Sylvester with its tail. The attack penetrated his right arm, but as soon as it hit him, he used the weapon in his other hand and severed the stinger from the end of the monster&amp;#39;s tail. Shadow hissed as it jumped back. Greta&amp;#39;s wicked smile disappeared, and she looked at Sylvester in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Surprised bitch?! A normal knife shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to cut your little pet so easily, right? Take a look at my weapon, isn&amp;#39;t it familiar?  I didn&amp;#39;t think it would be so useful, but now I am glad I picked it up. Now you will fucking pay for what you&amp;#39;ve done!&amp;quot; said Sylvester while walking menacingly towards Greta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow attacked him again, using its claws this time. My friend stepped back to avoid the strike and threw the dagger with surprising accuracy into the monster&amp;#39;s left eye. It let out a painful cry but continued attacking. My friend evaded the beast&amp;#39;s claws again, reached for the dagger stuck in its eye, gave it a good twist, and pulled it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of striking the monster again, he charged at Greta. Shadow was still recovering, so it couldn&amp;#39;t interfere. Greta started backing up, but soon hit the wall and had nowhere to run. Sylvester lunged towards her, ready to kill. The blade was getting closer and closer, but when it almost reached her throat, there was a loud bang, and the dagger shattered into a thousand pieces. Sylvester was looking at the remains of the weapon with confusion when Shadow&amp;#39;s large claws tore his head off from behind. It happened so fast he didn&amp;#39;t even have time to scream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greta realized that she was no longer in danger, and the evil grin returned to her face. She slowly walked to the severed head of my friend, picked it up, and started speaking to it. &amp;quot;I  have underestimated you. Thought you were just a stupid asshole, but I must admit I was wrong. You were bold enough to pick up my dagger during the ritual. You maybe even could have killed poor Shadow if you didn&amp;#39;t try to attack me. But hurting a Witch with her own sacrificial weapon is not possible. Shame you had to learn it this way,&amp;quot; she let go of Sylvester&amp;#39;s head and turned to me, &amp;quot;now let&amp;#39;s finish this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still kneeling on the ground and didn&amp;#39;t even try to stand up, I accepted my fate. Shadow was right in front of me, its left eye was closed, and blood kept dripping from it. But its rage-filled right eye was looking straight at me. As its mouth opened, the stench of blood and decay almost made me pass out. I closed my eyes and prepared for the pain I was about to experience. But instead, a small hand dragged me up to my feet. I was sure Greta decided to kill me personally, so I kept my eyes closed, but instead of a killing blow, I felt her cold lips pressed against mine as she put her hand on my back and pulled me closer. It was not a kiss of passion nor love, it was dominant and violent, but I could not resist it... or rather, I didn&amp;#39;t dare to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She pushed me back to the ground when she was done. I noticed that the terrible smell has vanished, and I couldn&amp;#39;t hear Shadow&amp;#39;s heavy breathing either, so I opened my eyes. Greta was standing in front of me. But next to her, there was only a small black cat, instead of the monster. Its left eye and the end of its tail was still missing, and its remaining eye was dark red, but otherwise, it was the same small, black cat I knew from my childhood. Greta looked at me one last time with a satisfied smile, then she picked up Shadow, turned around, and walked out of the classroom. My vision started to become blurry as I watched her leave. Once I could no longer hear her footsteps everything faded into darkness... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I woke in a hospital bed. After a few moments of peace, the memories of the massacre came flooding back. I started to shiver and scream uncontrollably. I was sure Greta and Shadow would come bursting through the door any second. I lost touch with reality, and it stayed like that for many months. I only had brief moments of clarity here and there. I can remember how Police officers told me that I was the only survivor.  I can remember that they were asking me about the murders, and I also remember that they never believed anything I said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, I didn&amp;#39;t care about it. Most of the time, I was in a world of nightmares anyway. I relived that day again and again, and each time I saw all of my blood-covered, mangled schoolmates vividly. I couldn&amp;#39;t eat or sleep properly and considered taking my own life almost every day. I might have never recovered if my parents didn&amp;#39;t spend a fortune on psychiatrists. Of course, they never believed me either, but at least they could help me get my life somewhat together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow it will be exactly ten years since Greta killed everyone in my school. I  still ask myself the same questions every day. Why did all those people have to die? Why was I left alive? From the outside, it would seem that I have a normal life, steady job, and great friends, but to tell the truth, I haven&amp;#39;t felt alive since that day. Like I told you in the beginning, I am writing this because I&amp;#39;m probably going to die tomorrow, but I don&amp;#39;t care I must go, I need answers. Last week I found a note in my mailbox with no address or name on it, but I knew exactly who sent it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to know what happened all those years ago, come to our school on the tenth anniversary of my blood ritual.  I will be waiting for you in the classroom where it started. The school is abandoned now so nobody will disturb us.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You belong to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
