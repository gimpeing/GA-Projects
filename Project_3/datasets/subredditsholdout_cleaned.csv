1,like people first job teen wanted little extra pocket money buying stuff hanging friend sort thing much like teenager typical scenario typical kid well part anyway applied bunch different place one got job offer settled convenience store road family apartment building interesting choice know like teenager looking minimum wage work ha plentiful option simple fact within easy walking distance home enough reason choose others pretty standard sort place usual trapping run mill convenience store think used eleven since found couple old sign back storeroom time working privately owned went name rick may nick something else generic like honestly never remember shopped time since place close noticed sort major red flag particular part city located relatively low traffic safe employee seemed happy enough ever one maybe two people manning store one time seemed like generally left device overall seemed like normal relatively pleasant place work except one little abnormal detail come end training pretty standard fare far part time minimum wage work go met guy store early name mike previously spoken length phone another employee taking care customer showed around place got acquainted machine procedure went rule would need follow helped legal stuff paperwork needed fill new employee said pretty standard stuff though mike one final thing said needed talk see simply assumed whole time mike manager assistant manager something like however quite case mike simply senior employee time though trusted handle training new employee thing occasionally outside another worker manager owner place man name mr downey mike led room back building appeared something office sort say office thing distinguished room small metal desk pushed one wall top desk two way radio sitting charging dock nothing else room completely barren feature note set stair went second floor mike went explain mr downey lived second floor establishment though handled necessary responsibility owning managing business hated disturbed never came downstairs business hour time anyone building radio needed talk emergency mr downey apparently even bother respond tried contact reason obviously bit weirded mike reassured though bit strange never really much issue despite reclusive mr downey good managing everything delivery handled time repair servicing requested promptly everything required employee properly communicated written note left store beginning day unconventional sure worked apparently couple year mike working never spoken directly mr downey even far knew one entirely convinced however see something worth refusing job ended shrugging honestly though mike right despite never seen even spoken person working everything generally went rather smoothly manager since seen spoken almost every single day manage run thing even half well mr downey go far say convenience store one best working environment entire life lie though every strangeness would make bit uncomfortable security camera room main level bothered bit monitor anything access logically speaking left one person could monitoring feed every working glance camera shudder bit idea watched maybe even constantly unsettling say least ever thought brief moment though mr downey seem nitpicky sort never really sort performance review much way feedback one worker got busted stealing really indication ever got mr downey might actually paying attention pretty easy forget camera part much anything else complain really laid back pleasant sort gig course good time anyone ever worked sort service industry job tell one uncontrollable aspect job turn reasonably good day bad one drop hat worst part service industry job customer course fair share awful customer working convenience store well however one stand particular woman generally referred karen name karen karen every way imagine think name christy something like never really made effort try remember frankly wanted spend little time thinking interacting humanly possible however seemed want exact opposite usually came least week always something new complain maybe something something thought maybe store hot cold perhaps lighting bright dim maybe poor service matter think something gripe matter would always back frankly suspected came specifically blow steam laying whoever happened working time absolutely despised however behavior reason still think day see karen thing always wanted speak manager sort running theme every single complaint asked demanded speak manager see knowing told mr downey probably pretty obvious never going happen employee gave every excuse book sick et cetera tell would take note complaint let manager know begrudgingly accept best going get however never gave asking eventually excuse longer good enough misfortune one person working finally reached breaking point forget initial complaint honestly really matter time taking answer manager available going wait bit taken aback figured new thing could last long however two hour hanging around store realized thing going easy quietly standing either getting angry random inane outburst even starting scare customer debating calling police handle paused second guessing glancing briefly security camera angled towards counter thought probably one decide quickly ducked back grabbed two way radio holding mouth never really type get nervous phone call sort thing take deep calming breath could bring press button side radio hey mr downey said voice shaking bit know noticed know camera customer making scene wanting speak turning bit issue trailed mouth feeling weirdly dry waited moment see would get response continued met silence know exactly emergency per se getting point might need get police involved well figured would even bother wanted see wanted handle response stood several minute silence feeling like sort idiot beginning ready absolute ordeal would turn call police heard something sound radio voice anything immediately recognizable listened closer holding device ear realized hearing background noise mixed slight amount static person end holding button without speaking could barely make noise static faint could maybe imagined low hum sort intermittent clicking thought bubbling could spend much time trying analyze noise thought interrupted dry raspy voice person could mr downey said send stood moment sort processing whole situation bit outlandish felt uncomfortable mr downey request figured still better getting police involved made way back storefront trying figure going present karen way reasonable normal sounding possible oddly enough karen took stride without giving chance really explain mr downey simply jumped conclusion probably sort invalid something like mattered still going give piece mind either way really wanting go effort trying correct sort meekly agreed besides mr downey could actually seriously ill otherwise disabled knew know self assurance came confidence simple irritation followed back office stomped stair without batting eye tried twist handle door let door top stair still locked turned around give snide comment cut chance asking give second looked around office try find camera wave get mr downey attention seem actually one room reason many reason spend much time back entirely surprising noticed lacking real direction opted pick radio back pressing button muttered receiver without even two second delay spoken radio loud click door top stair swung open bit weird say least door old wooden like used year certainly sort door expect automatic could see mechanism door open even bottom stair perfectly concealed door use door set specific intention mind could seen open door short hallway another closed door end almost like airlock something like karen looked back towards shoulder first trace unease leaking confident expression shrugged noncommittally response word reassurance give would given willingly even much new territory stepped forward watched first door slowly swung closed behind latch snapping back place moment later waited moment see radio would crackle life instruction mr downey remained silent left counter unattended long enough simply took silence mean get back work busied attending daily task helping customer messing around phone time however get mind going upstairs reclusive mr downey decided actually meet someone long time presumably direct contact anyone karen people sure may wanted duty manager calm angry customer small paranoid part telling simple world going one two three hour passed karen still returned second floor nearing end shift stocking one shelf debated going go explaining situation next shift sudden became aware presence behind whatever made single sound whipped around stumbling back bit letting slightly embarrassing startled yelp karen idea long standing watching somehow wandered downstairs storefront back office without seen heard even heard breathing wait breathing quickly lost track train thought though saw expression leathery sundried skin face wrinkled year consistent frowning twisted widest unnatural smile ever seen every single one teeth exposed truly ghoulish behold looked forced much must hurt twist face extent almost seemed stuck way could steady ask okay thanked time clenched teeth left store walking stiff brisk walk stood quite sure process happened karen sudden change jarring far many way happened upstairs bring change whatever hoped permanent serving customer like would much much worse fortunately also far unfortunately would last time saw day karen got home beat two young child death bare hand afterwards waited husband get home promptly stabbing neck kitchen knife front door neighbor witnessed called police time arrived karen already hung murder exactly uncommon large city like mine rarely get attention probably however particular instance talk town quite still circle though sudden severe violence crime along apparent lack motive play part case notoriety main reason talked rather information would leak course investigation really drew people attention notably various bit piece found missing karen body autopsy seemingly wound account extraction reasonable explanation fourth circulatory system three inch large intestine entirety parietal lobe notable example throughout investigation convenience store never connected crime meaningful way long thought going police tell happened almost something happened change mind see got next paycheck mr downey sent little note along read dark red ink would best u never speak police happened along little crude drawing eye message clear enough meaning eye little bit le thought first simply meant keeping eye probably doe part however soon convinced camera footage wherever show taking karen back office camera inside office seriously doubt would second floor would far easy implicate make accomplice culprit lord know hard establish motive sure police could believe story willing gamble besides may harsh say way willing risk well well family self righteous sense justice call coward sure sure hell idiot stick around working convenience store long year gone long moved away city worked many different job even started family ever spoken police anyone else life happened likely never still think every convenience store closed year incident ownership building passed someone else real record mr downey existed even prove real name old deed still idea mr downey hopefully never want speak manager

gave ample opportunity think dirk told crime couple supposed carried true reason doubt really care happened two tolerate lot thing far violence crime concerned absolutely cannot stand people harm young child period regard mission became slightly easier accept thing certainly started become interesting following day since asked dirk couple given instruction set ashore ha always denied simply said couple took upon make way forest toward centre island toward area native hanging instructed followed behind observing every move quite easy given loud ever seen hollywood movie depicting young american backpacker southeast asia always loud rowdy stand like cat swimming pool young couple played role well would describe laid back pot smoking hippie type guy woman ever referred chase long blonde hair tied back ponytail wore dirty old sweatband around head every second word coming mouth seemed take easy cool awesome spend twelve hour listening first day guess could say starting rub wrong way young woman slightly le annoying quite sure talked whole lot le chase guess never really know answer question long hair partner quite attractive often wondered since long would survived stayed beach going occasional swim dozing makeshift shelter piece tarpaulin stretched forty five degree angle rope strung two pole luck side maybe would lasted extra day maybe even week impossible tell given exercise futility go truth matter walking inland le hour thing started go downhill started strange noise sounded like someone regurgitating vocal cord heart skipped beat straight away felt adrenaline rush bloodstream noise made animal human made sound something confirmed moment later bird tree u sudden took froze stood absolutely still fearing close native young duo however seemed oblivious kept walking talking loudly oh god thought going walk straight immediately realised thing applied idea native suspected somewhere ahead u trying pinpoint exact location sound jungle extremely difficult knew could behind u also real possibility already visual u getting ready strike fuck get tricked spying kid insisted sticking original mission moved around pace crazy could well get killed quickly scanned surroundings unable see anyone apart young couple walking ahead without slightest idea precarious situation heart hammering away wound taut piano wire first time since set foot island started feel scared strange sound continued could tell whoever caused approaching kneeled rested haunch reached grabbed knife sheath attached leg clutched tightly held front chest hand holding shaking badly dawned might use long big tree twenty yard ahead decided make dash took deep breath stepped away bush hiding behind made way toward strange sound close finally able pinpoint coming coming directly ahead u top slight hill made safely tree carefully stuck head look started whooshing sound familiar thump arrow make whenever imbeds tree trunk see hit could see chase turn toward right stare something suspected arrow hit tree next forty yard behind young couple slightly left slightly lower elevation took second two reacted arrow loud holy fuck second passed could hear whooshing sound arrow still hitting target time arrow jolt young couple paralysis normal people would done situation threw around bolted back direction come moment later got second glimpse native since arriving island time lot agitated four probably hunter looking food accidentally come across young couple stayed moving single muscle key avoid getting spotted environment apart using right camouflage make sudden movement instead followed tiny camera attached hat turned head slowly upmost smoothly possible member fear inc wanted see paid premium membership scene would play hunter finally caught young couple killed fucking sick messed world thought waited native passed relieved discover noticed counted three pushed away tree time running real danger losing track young woman screaming hysterically native making loud regurgitating sound time sending arrow could see one throwing spear stepped vegetation found natural path could follow forty yard thereabouts behind native slightly right making way back toward beach million thought racing head moment one kept repeating whether young couple going make forest also wondered realised futility action matter long ran end native would catch whole thing would come abrupt end fate sealed moment jumped zodiac kept running another minute stopped took cover behind tree could see woman lying ground hand pressed thigh arrow blood seeping wound see struck see moment native caught screaming frantically stopped front arm shot protect addition kicking good leg believed would somehow keep bay match guy spear ran forward holding high head hand thrusting quick downward motion weapon hit lower abdomen able see wooden weapon bury body face contorted pain scream intensified thirty yard away could see everything going others joined shooting arrow hitting looked like mattock scythe word truly describe witnessing barbaric savagery attacking like worthless rodent regurgitating sound interspersed sick slashing sound sharp implement piercing skin hard wooden club hitting bone shattering felt physically ill twitched uncontrollably par incident witnessed congo year earlier woman stage realised facing arm stretched good strategy odds managed turn onto side attempting drag away use injury sustained tapped strength matter time would turned wait long moment later came quick end native spear rammed back neck plunged sharp tip throat point everything stopped attempt getting away hysterical scream guess live taken le four minute time native first discovered young couple time woman lying motionlessly ground blood covering body looked around boyfriend nowhere seen probably still running toward beach trying save hide remember ambivalent feeling action one hand coward leaving girlfriend behind hand people full blown panic mode trying get away imminent threat also reminded done little girl treatment bad one witnessed held thought order better deal mentally seen pursue boyfriend least straight away thing take care tying vine around young woman head hoisting forest floor used thick branch achieve leg two foot ground tied vine around ankle secured tree nearby ensuring body remained still literally started gut one hunter stepped forward removed sharp metal like object rope slung shoulder proceeded push object woman lower abdomen really ramming quick upward movement metal object sliced way solar plexus region innards came pouring like bucketful gore forced look careful move camera away action organisation would doubt zoom gruesome scene quite possibly even slow member miss thing spent hour mutilating body finally moved walking direction beach boyfriend managed escape followed mindful would happen ever caught glimpse next seven hour tailing hunter around southern tip island split two group made job considerably complicated two patrolling tree line closest beach two focused area inland spent half hour thereabouts studying campsite eventually found going content backpack far could tell take anything maybe

hour sundown left area able take quick break get something eat notify dirk happened spent remaining hour daylight trying pick trail guy found sun dipped horizon actually see could see faint footprint leading hiding spot done right thing tried cover track best could smoothing sand behind seeing arrow sink tree next first crossed path native knowing girlfriend captured mention listen horrific cry ran away must shaken bone thus sloppy made way across beach taken enough time thorough job knew intended get visual later evening wearing night vision goggles place chosen behind cluster boulder right next ocean visible forest hide hour spot would perfect spend prolonged period good natural cover hour hot daytime sun without water brain would start fry good strategy would move another location sun went head back campsite get water provision find new location lay low guy experienced soldier witnessed traumatic episode remained get visual hour sundown literally hanging onto boulder dear life face pressed rock would somehow make harder native spot night settled new hiding spot overlooking cluster boulder knew see another sunset native would resume search following morning would give treatment
