,Thetruthishere,"This happened a few years ago on a camping trip, but it feels like yesterday. 

Me and my friend, both teen girls at the time, were sleeping a few yards from her aunt's trailer in a little tent. After goofing off for a while, we settled down. I faced one side of the tent, she faced the other.

I was just starting to fall asleep when I could tell a bright light was illuminating the tent (you know how you can tell the lights are on, even when your eyes are closed?). Assuming it was a car or something of the sort driving by, I kept trying to sleep. I heard an odd scratching sound as well, but didn't think much about it. I felt my friend tap my shoulder, but for some reason thought she had just rolled over while sleeping and had done it by accident. 

Finally, after another tap to the shoulder, I slowly and quietly turned to face her side of the tent. 

There was an incredibly bright light, brighter than any flashlight I've seen, pointing straight at the tent. There was only one point of light, so it couldn't have been a car. The best comparison I could draw is a motorcycle, but we would have heard a motorcycle approach the tent, or any vehicle for that matter. This wasn't the scary part, though. 

It looked as though some kind of hooked saw-like object was being dragged slowly against the fabric of the tent, and made very much visible by the abrasive light, but we could not see anything holding it up. Then, the light just switched off and we didn't hear or see anything else that night. 

When we worked up the courage to book it the few yards to the trailer her aunt was in, we didn't see anyone or anything out of place outside. After we got inside, she told me that before I had turned around to look at whatever she had seen, multiple shapes similar to the weird hooked saw thing were very clearly dragged against the tent, still with nothing seeming to hold them up. All equally terrifying and sharp looking, but nothing like I'd ever seen. Looked like the contents of a toolbox from hell.

Not exactly the most terrifying, but it absolutely rattled me to my core and I still cannot explain it.

,Thetruthishere,"So I had an encounter a few months ago, and I feel like maybe this could be a good place to post it. 

I was sitting in my living room watching tv around 8:30pm, and it was already pretty dark outside. All of the sudden I hear knocks on my door, so I get up to see who’s there- no one I know ever knocks on the door, they just walk right in. 
So anyway, standing on my porch are these three guys. Just one look at them and I was freaked out. They seemed like almost caricatures of humans, but ones that walked straight out of hell and onto my doorstep. (I keep thinking about the MadTV kid, yanno?) They were dressed up like Mormon boys in suits, but their name tags only said Jesus Christ. They never introduced themselves, and kept asking for people by name.
Honestly I can’t convey how uncomfortable they made me feel. I can barely remember their faces now, but one guy in the middle was just staring and smiling the entire time. I don’t know how, but my instincts were telling me that something was very wrong. 
I never opened the door fully, and got out of the conversation by telling them I was cold and didn’t really feel like talking. Haven’t seen them or heard anything about them since then. It’s been months now and still just thinking about it freaks sick to my stomach.

,Thetruthishere,"I believe in the paranormal, but with a healthy dose of skepticism. For example, I believe most instances of 'orbs' are just dust motes illuminated by camera flash. Nor is every decrepit abandoned house haunted. Though when you brush with something, especially a disruptive something, it has a distinct feel. 

Over the last year, I've had a handful of recognizable brushes with something that just doesn't like me. The feeling is mutual. 

A year ago my girlfriend invited me to move in with her full time. I'd stayed over before for a weekend. Nothing seemed off about the place, or the living arrangement. I didn't get goose pimples, or a sense of dread when I roamed around the place. Shortly after her invitation, I chose to move in with her.

She was rather insistent that I move in immediately. I decided just to pull up stakes and find a job in the area after I moved in. This meant I spent most of the day alone in the house.

It took a lot longer than I thought it would to get an entry level job in the area. After a while, I took to laying in bed for an hour or two out of the day. That's when I started to notice strange noises.

They sounded like radio commercials, and music. Though I could never quite make out what was said. The voices had the tones of males &amp; females, but all I could hear was garbled nonsense. Just recall radio commercials for local businesses, interspersed with semi-discordant 'music', and you're probably close to the mark.

A little while after that, I started having vivid jarring dreams. In one I was holding an infant then I had a seizure, and started squeezing the baby. I couldn't let go, and it had a horrified look on it's face. That woke me up, and once I could go back to sleep I was hit with another.

The next one came as soon as I went back to sleep. I was standing in a backyard, then I heard young children's panicked screaming. I ran inside, just to see a toddler age child running out the front door with an infant slung over their shoulder.

I got to the toddler, and infant, in the driveway where the toddler dropped the baby. The baby started vomiting a large amount of green fluid. I woke up just as I had picked up the infant, and went to call for medics. Immediately upon waking, I clearly heard; ""Every smart homeowner knows...."", and it faded away. 

We didn't have a radio, or television on. It seemed like the same kind of commercial mimicry, but with more clarity.  

On another night, I woke up to a hard slap on the side of my head. I saw my girlfriend standing over me, with tears running down her cheeks. She disappeared when I yelled; ""Why the hell did you hit me?!?!?!"" To which my girlfriend, laying next to me all along, sleepily stated; ""I didn't hit you. What are you talking about?""

A couple weeks after that, my girlfriend went to bed earlier than I. I was on my computer in the finished basement, almost directly under the bedroom. After a few hours she messaged me, and asked me to come upstairs. She said it sounded like there was a block party outside, and she heard people talking outside the window.

If there had been anything like that, I would have heard it as well. I heard nothing of the sort, whilst in pretty much the same side of the house. The neighborhood had been quiet all night, for me, at least.

We resolved to move the bed, just in case we were picking up radio broadcasts or some other odd signal. She had heard the same things as well, before I moved in. The adjustment seemed to significantly cut down on the odd 'commercial' noises. Though I noticed them for a couple of seconds, especially when tensions between her and I were elevated.

Over the coming months, there were a host of other small odd occurrences. After the basement became unnaturally cold, I began to feel like I wasn't alone. I would catch brief glimpses of a naked man, facing away from me, in the basement. I had a general feeling I wasn't welcome.

The worst instance happened when I was in the middle of remodeling the basement half bath. I went from sweating, to practically freezing in an instant. I felt like something was standing just behind and off to the side, with about as much directed menace as I'd ever felt.

I'm not religious, but I started naming as many saints as I could remember while I finished my process. Then I got the hell out of there, and decided I would stream some games from the basement PC to the upstairs television while my girlfriend slept in. I started having all kinds of bandwidth problems, then somehow I was signed out of my account. To my knowledge, that needs to be done manually. 

Shortly after that, she woke up from a bad dream. She was with her mother, and they came back to her mother's house to find the door ajar. They found her cats had been messily slaughtered, and fed to dogs with various antisemitic epithets spray painted on them. 

All throughout this time, our relationship deteriorated. She would become physically violent at times. All I could do was block her, and attempt to restrain her. This eventually became emotionally abusive as well. The shark-like look of pure hate in her eyes is the most disturbing. Like the woman I know just wasn't there.

I kept waking up in the middle of the night, flailing. I felt under attack. One night I bashed my hand on the nightstand. Another night I woke up outside, fully clothed. She said I was acting like a lunatic. 

It all became too much for me, and I moved out. I worry about her, so we still keep in contact. Yet another strange thing happened last night.

We were talking on the phone but I eventually became too tired, and fell asleep. She stayed on the line, because listening to me sleep helps calm her. When I woke up, we were disconnected. I checked my messages, and she wanted me to call her back. 

I blearily called her back, and started to go back to sleep. I heard a faint voice on the line, which I brushed off as some podcast on her tablet until she started 'responding to me'. I perked up a bit, and heard a voice that sounded like mine. Though I couldn't make out what was being said.

I asked her who she was talking to, which confused her. She thought she was talking to me. I asked her what the voice had said to her, and she said it sounded like me asking her if she was doing okay - if she had found a job. I told her I had said nothing, though I had heard something that sounded like me.

Naturally this unsettled her, as we both know something is wrong in the house. I don't know if there's something in the house itself, or if it can be tied to a certain relic she has. It's a Chokwe (tribe from Angola) mask, which symbolizes a mother being separated from her child as he enters manhood. I've urged her to donate it to some curator, as there are several in the area. 

The tribe itself is known to use their crafts as commodities, so I can't be certain about that angle.

&lt;p&gt;Naturally this unsettled her, as we both know something is wrong in the house. I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s something in the house itself, or if it can be tied to a certain relic she has. It&amp;#39;s a Chokwe (tribe from Angola) mask, which symbolizes a mother being separated from her child as he enters manhood. I&amp;#39;ve urged her to donate it to some curator, as there are several in the area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tribe itself is known to use their crafts as commodities, so I can&amp;#39;t be certain about that angle. Though I know something in that house is disruptive, and loves to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a little bit difficult to talk about, as it happened last Thursday night and is still very emotional. A little back story, I have always been in touch with the other side, they use me a lot. Typically, I have no emotional connection with any spirit I come in contact with. This was different.

An important piece of information is that I have a six year old daughter. When I go outside, often times she will be directly on the other side of the front door and asking when I'll be back in.

In the early afternoon, my wife and I had stepped outside for a few minutes. As usual, I heard a little girl on the other side of the door. Not so usual, this little girl said momma. My daughter always calls me mommy or mom. I answered ""yes dear"" just as I always would, but there was no response from the other side of the door. I realized that my daughter was playing in her room the whole time.

Later that night, my wife and I were laying in bed scrolling reddit and my six year old had only just fallen asleep. I heard what sounded like 6yo getting out of bed. I waited for her to come to our door, but she never showed. I got up to check on her, she was still very much asleep. I crawled back into bed and after a few moments, I heard it again. We have cats, so hearing noises at night isn't out of the ordinary. I thought nothing of it.

Whenever 6yo is standing in my doorway, I can feel it. Awake or asleep, I feel it. Well, I had that same feeling after hearing the noise again. I turned around expecting to see my dark haired green eyed daughter, only the child I saw was so blonde her hair was almost white, and her eyes were golden brown. I looked away for a split second at my wife and the child was gone. About 30 seconds later, I heard that same voice say ""momma"" just as a few hours earlier. My wife did not see her nor hear her, but she very clearly heard it the first time.

The age of this child is what mine would have been, had I not miscarried. The father is blonde with golden eyes. She had my curls and his chubby cheeks. I could just feel that she was my baby. She came to me because I needed something to keep me going.

Mostly they'd be about strange and random things but didn't bother me much, and I enjoyed telling friends about them.\n\nHowever, recently I've noticed that my dreams have become quite strange.\n\nPretty much since I turned 16  in Dec, the same girl has appeared in my dreams. What I find strange is not only how I can remember her face quite clearly, but also how I seem to see her in another time, like it's a past life. I cannot possibly describe all of my dreams with her in detail, as each one would be at least 2000 words long. I will provide a few though, in italics.\n\n*The first time I met her we seemed to be in a garden, with a wooden swing bench and a tree in the middle. I waited there and then she appeared under the tree, I kissed her and then we made out on the bench. We then went down to a city and flew around and even walked through shops and streets, but we were still invisible to everyone else. At some point I did become visible at will though, scaring a man in a bookstore, which I thought was funny. The dream ended with us departing on a boat somewhere. The landscape was not natural at all. I believe this dream was more of a symbolic one than literal one, and a few of my dreams with her are like that.*\n\nAlthough I'm not a heavily spiritual person, I do believe these are past life dreams.Some of the past life dreams are more normal though, like us going to a beach or a town for example. Other ones do not feature her at all, and are just memories of another family or moments by myself. For timelines sake, I believe the ones with her took place in the very late 90s, especially how I remember watching in a cinema and also seeing an advert for Ep.1 of Star Wars, which came out in 1999 I believe. My relationship with her seems to be quite a close one, I'm quite sure homosexual, though I don't understand how we would have hidden that since homophobia was still common in the 90s. We seem to have a car as well, though I think it is more likely hers since she has driven it in all of the occasions I have seen her. It's a red car, I don't know the model but it seems to be from the late 80s or early 90s. I have searched online for one similar with no luck. I have also tried searching for the locations in my dreams on google maps, but I gave up a few days later realising it will take a lifetime. I would also like to add that I have seen a very similar car in real life after those dreams, but only twice. It was quite elusive both times though, I didn't get to see a driver or model.\n\nThis is where things become even more spiritual, though. Recently I haven't dreamt of her I don't think, but there have been many strange signs irl. For example, last Friday I decided to go on a small walk before returning home. I didn't go far, just down a street near my own house. At one of the dead ends of this street is a wall overlooking a graveyard. I just wanted to know if there was a bench I could read on so I looked over it. When I turned back around to return home, I walked a bit then found a plain brown glass marble leaning against the kerb. I picked it up, and it instantly reminded me of her. It was kind of chipped in some places, but I still thought it was nice. It had a warm aura to it, it reminded me of her eyes and her seemingly gentle nature. The next evening a bead I found like 2 years ago was on the floor next to me for some reason whilst I was doing revision. I was certain I had kept it in a drawer somewhere, but just guessed I might have taken it out accidentally. I believe it's a rosary bead, but I'm not too sure. It's wooden and spherical with a small hole, but seems to have a glossy layer over it and the wood shines when rolled in light.\n\nBefore I went to sleep last night, I remembered that meditation does help me sleep sometimes, so I decided to try it out again. However, this time I held the marble and bead in a hand each, meditating for about 2 minutes. I don't know why I did that, out of curiosity maybe? I managed to fall asleep better than usual though, however the dream I had was not normal at all, even for me.\n\n*I was in a dense forest, and it was quite dark, but not night. The sky was grey like it was about to rain heavily. The trees had some leaves, but they were quite faded, either dark green or brown. The area I was in had some wooden structures, like huts and walled areas made out of wooden planks. But they had been completely abandoned. I suddenly felt like I was being watched, so I found my way out of that area. I found a clearing which  was wooden decking over a very circular lake or pool. It had 5 symmetrical pentagonal huts which were all different colours and left to rot. One of them i remember had dark blue tarpaulin with white or yellow stars covering it. I still had a strong feeling of being watched, but from behind me, and I began running around the clearing looking for a place to hide or leave as I panicked. I stopped and glanced into the woods to my right. A dark figure or shadow met me when I stopped. It stared directly at me, and I couldn't tell if it was a pace ahead of me or a pace behind. Before I could do anything, I was in a car park, behind some run down buildings. There was a few vans and no one was around. The feeling was strong, and I instantly closed my eyes. I didn't want to see anything. I looked towards the ground. Through the slits of my eyes i could see it standing right in front of me. The fear became intimidation, but the moment before I woke up it suddenly felt reassuring. I woke up after that in the dead of night and my room was silent but i felt like i was being watched, it was an intense feeling, almost like someone was actually there. I was too scared to check though, since this has never happened to me so strongly before. I just faced the wall and instantly went back to sleep which is weird for me.*\n\nIn addition to this, today at 15:41 I noticed my ear had become infected, which I thought was very strange since I take very good care of my piercings and just my hygiene in general. As I arrived home at about 15:50, I helped my mother with the shopping, and she noticed a small object on the floor. She did not recognise it, and asked me if it was mine. I took it from her and later inspected it. At first I thought it was a brooche or pin, however after further inspection I realised it was an earring that had the metal stick thing bent. It was a small silver owl with black gemstone eyes, and a larger grey gemstone stomach. I found an earring after my ear became suddenly infected, I thought this was odd.\n\nI think that maybe these objects are left by her for me, kind of like little presents or what's on my mind. The marble can be due to the fact that in the past week I was thinking about how I used to find marbles a lot as a child, along with other random things. Then the earring could be a result of my ear being infected. But since I found a lot of things as a child, does this mean she was always around?\n\nI don't have much else to say right at this moment, other than that whenever I seem to speak of someone in any manner they seem to either appear in real life or join a voice chat instantly. Also, whenever I get bad vibes from someone, I always turn out to be right these days.\n\nI've woken up crying after these dreams a few times, since I feel immense sorrow deep down somewhere after them, but I also feel joy after I see her.\n\nIt's been on my mind for months, I'd be really grateful for any kind of explanation, and for advice on what I can do to get some kind of stronger connection with her, to see her more in my dreams properly and maybe communicate with her safely.\n\nIf you have read this far down then thank you, it means a lot."", 'author_fullname': 't2_7b6h6g', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Odd dreams/Haunting from a past life?', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Advice'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Paranormal', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'f', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fg0la7', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 5, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Advice', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 5, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': 1583783645.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583812165.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.Paranormal', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(sorry I know this is quite long, and I&amp;#39;m new here)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always had quite vivid dreams, even when I was very young. Mostly they&amp;#39;d be about strange and random things but didn&amp;#39;t bother me much, and I enjoyed telling friends about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, recently I&amp;#39;ve noticed that my dreams have become quite strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty much since I turned 16  in Dec, the same girl has appeared in my dreams. What I find strange is not only how I can remember her face quite clearly, but also how I seem to see her in another time, like it&amp;#39;s a past life. I cannot possibly describe all of my dreams with her in detail, as each one would be at least 2000 words long. I will provide a few though, in italics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first time I met her we seemed to be in a garden, with a wooden swing bench and a tree in the middle. I waited there and then she appeared under the tree, I kissed her and then we made out on the bench. We then went down to a city and flew around and even walked through shops and streets, but we were still invisible to everyone else. At some point I did become visible at will though, scaring a man in a bookstore, which I thought was funny. The dream ended with us departing on a boat somewhere. The landscape was not natural at all. I believe this dream was more of a symbolic one than literal one, and a few of my dreams with her are like that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#39;m not a heavily spiritual person, I do believe these are past life dreams.Some of the past life dreams are more normal though, like us going to a beach or a town for example. Other ones do not feature her at all, and are just memories of another family or moments by myself. For timelines sake, I believe the ones with her took place in the very late 90s, especially how I remember watching in a cinema and also seeing an advert for Ep.1 of Star Wars, which came out in 1999 I believe. My relationship with her seems to be quite a close one, I&amp;#39;m quite sure homosexual, though I don&amp;#39;t understand how we would have hidden that since homophobia was still common in the 90s. We seem to have a car as well, though I think it is more likely hers since she has driven it in all of the occasions I have seen her. It&amp;#39;s a red car, I don&amp;#39;t know the model but it seems to be from the late 80s or early 90s. I have searched online for one similar with no luck. I have also tried searching for the locations in my dreams on google maps, but I gave up a few days later realising it will take a lifetime. I would also like to add that I have seen a very similar car in real life after those dreams, but only twice. It was quite elusive both times though, I didn&amp;#39;t get to see a driver or model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where things become even more spiritual, though. Recently I haven&amp;#39;t dreamt of her I don&amp;#39;t think, but there have been many strange signs irl. For example, last Friday I decided to go on a small walk before returning home. I didn&amp;#39;t go far, just down a street near my own house. At one of the dead ends of this street is a wall overlooking a graveyard. I just wanted to know if there was a bench I could read on so I looked over it. When I turned back around to return home, I walked a bit then found a plain brown glass marble leaning against the kerb. I picked it up, and it instantly reminded me of her. It was kind of chipped in some places, but I still thought it was nice. It had a warm aura to it, it reminded me of her eyes and her seemingly gentle nature. The next evening a bead I found like 2 years ago was on the floor next to me for some reason whilst I was doing revision. I was certain I had kept it in a drawer somewhere, but just guessed I might have taken it out accidentally. I believe it&amp;#39;s a rosary bead, but I&amp;#39;m not too sure. It&amp;#39;s wooden and spherical with a small hole, but seems to have a glossy layer over it and the wood shines when rolled in light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I went to sleep last night, I remembered that meditation does help me sleep sometimes, so I decided to try it out again.

,Thetruthishere,"When I was younger me and my friends enjoyed exploring abandoned houses. We had been to many, in and around our town. There was a specific house that we went back to many times to explore. It was a big building, split into two sides and very old, probably from the 18th century. It had a basement, 10 bedrooms and an attic (that we never managed to get into). 

I first discovered it when me and one other friend saw it from a field nearby my house. We had a look round and were pretty creeped out to say the least. There was a stairwell that lead to an underground room underneath the house that you could get to from outside. We went in and all the lights were on...we soon left after discovering this.

A few weeks later we were out with a group of our mates. There was probably 7 or 8 of us. We got the idea of returning to the house and so we did. We managed to get in this time, and we had a look round. All the lights worked and were connected to electricity, which confused me but we continued to look round. There was a large basement with furnaces and oven etc. All the rooms were pretty similar and we soon left as there wasn’t an awful amount to do.

Anyway, to the point. Recently me and two other friends decided to go back to the house. We were bored and figured it would be fun. It was around 8pm when we left so it was pitch black. The house backed onto a field so we chose to get to it from there. It was about a 15 minute walk from my house so it didn’t take us long. We entered the field and began trudging towards the house. 

We were slightly nervous, but we had done this before so it was nothing to be scared about. We slowly approached the back of the house, observing the windows (there were 5). It was very dark, but we did have a powerful torch so we had no trouble seeing. There was a fence surrounding the back of the house so in order to get in we would have to climb over this. My friend volunteered to go first and as he began climbing we heard the most terrifying sound. The word ‘meow’ came from inside of the house. We all froze. This was not a cat. Someone had mimicked the noise of a cat from inside of that house. For a split second we did nothing, and then we ran.

As we ran, a horrifying, cackling laugh came bellowing out of the house. We said nothing to each other we just sprinted towards the exit of the field. I was petrified and I was playing the noise over and over in my head, grimacing at who or what it could have been. When we got to the road we stopped running to catch our breath. We tried to discuss what had happened but none of us had answers, it was truly terrifying. We slowly calmed down as we walked towards my house and figured maybe it was somebody messing around. But that’s not the end of the story.

My house is very near to a mere which has a footpath that goes all the way around it. You can get to the town from my house by walking through the mere. On our way back we decided we wanted to go to town, still talking about what had happened and honestly still not really believing it actually had. We decided to cut through the mere to get to town as it was the quickest way, so we did. It was about 9pm by this point and any light was totally gone. I still had my touch, but we encountered a couple of walkers at the mere so I decided to turn it off so I wouldn’t blind anyone walking towards us. We walked and spoke as we entered the mere and it takes about 10 minutes to get round to the entrance to the town. It was very quiet, apart from our chatter there was no sound at all. Suddenly out of the bushes next to us came the same sound ‘meow’. It felt as if it was within a metre of us. This time we did not freeze. We ran so fucking fast away from that noise. The same cackling laugh came from the bushes as we ran, and I kid you not, it ran after us. Only for a short while, but it followed us as we sprinted away. 

To this day, I don’t know who or what that noise came from. But it followed us back from that house. Thinking about someone watching us and following us all the way back and knowing where i live.

,Thetruthishere,"So I have a long story with lot of moving parts, so bear with me. I think I will tell this story in the order events as I found out about them, rather than how they chronologically occurred.

To begin, I have this recurring dream that I've been having since middle school. I have it one or two times a year, but it's slowed down since I've gotten older. In the dream I'm at home, but it isn't my house. It's a big 2 or 3 story home that's shaped like a U. I've never seen anything like it before. I go upstairs to my mom's room in this dream and she's on the bed, seizing. My first thought is that she must be possessed. I call my brother in a panic and tell him mom is possessed. He just asks me if we need more bread or milk, because he's grocery shopping. We fight back and forth, he refuses to listen, and I eventually hang up and try to help my mom myself. Before I can do anything she stops seizing and looks out the window. I run to the window that overlooks the pool (in the middle of the U). I see a spirit flying into (out of?) the pool. I don't hear anything but I know his name is Chris. My mom is fine again.

It's a weird dream to keep having, but I've never thought too much of it. 

Moving forward to when I was in college. There was a Ouija board that had been on the game shelf of my house for as long as I can remember. None of us have ever touched it or played it, but it has always been there. I asked if I could take it with me to college. I thought it would be fun for my friends and I to use. I've been very interested in paranormal, but never really believed in it. I take it, and the first time I use it, I ask if it knows me. It says yes. I ask how. It spells MAMA. I disregard it, my friends I use it several times after that. Nothing particularly interesting really happens in the hundreds of other uses.

One night, a few years later, my family is all sitting in a hot tub late at night in late fall in our backyard. We were just looking at the stars but my little brother suggested we tell ghost stories. No one could come up with any, so we started talking about weird dreams and the meanings behind them instead. I offered to share mine, as I recently had one that I had several times before.

I tell this dream to my family and my mom and dad turn their necks so quickly to look at each other I swear I hear them crack. I ask them what's wrong and they say Chris is just someone from their past. They act awfully strange for a bit before my mom says that she does, actually, have a ghost story.

When my parents were teenagers and still dating my mom bought a Ouija board (the same one I took with me to college). She convinced my dad to use it with her and the had fun asking it questions about their future and what not. They ask several questions about their future and specifically, it if they'll ever have their own cars. It answers ""Grand Prix."" They asked for the name of the ghost their speaking to and it said *Christopher.* They didn't really play with it again due to just lack of interest.

Several months (maybe years?) after their first experience, my mom buys her first car. Lo and behold, it's a Grand Prix. I think the fact that the Ouija board predicted that was a realization they had several months after the purchase. Could be chocked up to subconscious, but a little weird.

**I will refer to my mom as ""M"" from here on**

Several months after the car, my parents are visiting friends in another state. They're there for a Superbowl party, I think. They're out of snacks for the party so my mom offers to drive to the store and get some. Now, my mom has always been a big fan of personalized license plates. So, of course, her Grand Prix had a license plate that said ""M's GP"".

She gets to the grocery store and the bag boy helped her carry her groceries to her car. They're loading them into the truck and he sees her license plate.

""Is your name M?""

""Yeah, it's my Grand Prix, why?""

""My friends in I were playing with a Ouija board the other night and it just kept saying ""where M, where M?""

She did not talk any longer with the bag boy or exchange any kind of information.

Now, to top things off, I'm working at my first job after college. I've been here for nearly two years, and only a few weeks ago did I realize, the building I work in is 3 stories tall and shaped like a U. It is nearly identical to the one from my dream, save for the fact there's a courtyard instead of a pool in the center.

 I'd love to hear any thoughts. It definitely feels like someone is looking for my mom, and now going through me to find her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's worth noting but my mom also seems to have a sort of sixth sense? She has dreams about people in strange rooms before they die, she's ran into someone in the grocery store and thought  ""he doesn't seem well"" weeks before he is diagnosed with cancer (and was outwardly 100% fine and normal), and she has told me that a few times as a child she has been so angry with someone (bullying her brother), she can't stop thinking about how much she hates them, and they've died shortly after.",t2_4h53311a,False,,0,False,Something is desperately trying to reach my mom,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,2,0,False,t3_fgho8c,False,dark,,public,34,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Ghosts/Apparitions,False,34,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583890771.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have a long story with lot of moving parts, so bear with me.

&lt;p&gt;Several months after the car, my parents are visiting friends in another state. They&amp;#39;re there for a Superbowl party, I think. They&amp;#39;re out of snacks for the party so my mom offers to drive to the store and get some. Now, my mom has always been a big fan of personalized license plates. So, of course, her Grand Prix had a license plate that said &amp;quot;M&amp;#39;s GP&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gets to the grocery store and the bag boy helped her carry her groceries to her car. They&amp;#39;re loading them into the truck and he sees her license plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is your name M?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s my Grand Prix, why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My friends in I were playing with a Ouija board the other night and it just kept saying &amp;quot;where M, where M?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did not talk any longer with the bag boy or exchange any kind of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to top things off, I&amp;#39;m working at my first job after college. I&amp;#39;ve been here for nearly two years, and only a few weeks ago did I realize, the building I work in is 3 stories tall and shaped like a U. It is nearly identical to the one from my dream, save for the fact there&amp;#39;s a courtyard instead of a pool in the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear any thoughts. It definitely feels like someone is looking for my mom, and now going through me to find her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s worth noting but my mom also seems to have a sort of sixth sense? She has dreams about people in strange rooms before they die, she&amp;#39;s ran into someone in the grocery store and thought  &amp;quot;he doesn&amp;#39;t seem well&amp;quot; weeks before he is diagnosed with cancer (and was outwardly 100% fine and normal), and she has told me that a few times as a child she has been so angry with someone (bullying her brother), she can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about how much she hates them, and they&amp;#39;ve died shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"About a week ago me and some friends were in a small old town. Old as in 100s of years old, these houses are at least a century old. Ghost town as you might put it. The town has about 2 streets. 

Me and a friend walk up to this house. This house was an old two story house with the small creepy windows at the top. It had a half wrapped around porch like the centennial houses back in the days. It has a wheel chair lift (which was up) onto their porch. 

The porch is completely fenced off so you can only stand on the steps. We notice that all of the windows and doors are blocked off. Like they have so much crap on their porch that there is no way into the house from the porch. Which was odd. Why would the wheelchair life be up if there’s no way into the house? We reasoned that either there’s still a person in a wheelchair inside or that someone put it up so people wouldn’t use it. There was also two cars in the driveway.

Anyways, we got back into the car, and I could feel someone watching me. I also got this strong wave of sadness. I knew something was off, and I didn’t feel like myself anymore. I felt so sad all of a sudden. My brain and thought process was turned to mush.

We stayed in this town for about 30 more minutes. I really wanted to get out of this town. I felt like something was really off. 

I noticed this guy. There was this guy sitting in his car on the side of the road. He had his phone out and it looked like he was video taping us. I think he noticed that we were watching him because he drove away. This could explain some of this lol.

,Thetruthishere,"This happened a year ago for context.
I had a dream I was in HS again in a place mixed with my birth place, where I was raised and, my future town I’m guessing. My mom comes to pick me up and, as we’re driving on the highway we go on a ramp. But, I notice before my mom does that it’s not done and, literally drops off. As I go to tell my mom she notices too but, at that point it was too late so, we start saying our I love yous, holding hands and our goodbyes. Surprisingly, the fall is slow and as we’re dropping in what feels like slow motion, we see all the lights of the cars on the other levels like a light show. This makes us laugh and we stay holding hands finally the car lands w a little jolt but we’re in one piece. As I go to express my surprise to my mom I feel my eyes droop and my neck just falls to the side. I woke up from it relatively calm but as I wake I realized there was smt at the foot of my bed. Couldn’t see a face or anything just a tall figure looking at me w his head tilted. For a sec I thought a man was watching me bc I could make out a white shirt and his figure was def not female. But all while I was running thru these things in my mind, unbeknownst to me I was screaming non stop so much so that my mom rushed to my room. As soon as my mom touched me he literally whisped away like smoke or sand in the wind. This all happened at 6 am btw so no devil hour and such. 
That day I later took a nap and, as I was napping I felt this intense bright light behind my eyes and, could not move or open my eyes. So, I just started praying to god to let me out of it and, as I said it I felt the light shutter away and I could open my eyes. Needless to say, I slept w in my parents room w my mom that night. I woke up at 6 again and, at the foot of my bed is the same figure but he’s not curious anymore just watching. I began screaming unknowingly again and, as soon as my mom touched me he whisped away again. 
That morning I told my mom adamant about what I saw. She then called my aunt (who is b spiritual and connected) and asked, she told my mom that was my guardian angel trying to warn me about a threat to/in my life. She said I’m lucky if I can see him and not many can say they have. 
So, the next night before I went to bed I prayed to god to never show me him again because, whatever threat was possibly in my life I think the Angel he sent would take me sooner than that w a heart attack. I also asked to send a handsome one and, not a terrifying one. I feel bad that I shut him out but, I can’t keep screaming awake.

I had a dream I was in HS again in a place mixed with my birth place, where I was raised and, my future town I’m guessing. My mom comes to pick me up and, as we’re driving on the highway we go on a ramp. But, I notice before my mom does that it’s not done and, literally drops off. As I go to tell my mom she notices too but, at that point it was too late so, we start saying our I love yous, holding hands and our goodbyes. Surprisingly, the fall is slow and as we’re dropping in what feels like slow motion, we see all the lights of the cars on the other levels like a light show. This makes us laugh and we stay holding hands finally the car lands w a little jolt but we’re in one piece. As I go to express my surprise to my mom I feel my eyes droop and my neck just falls to the side. I woke up from it relatively calm but as I wake I realized there was smt at the foot of my bed. Couldn’t see a face or anything just a tall figure looking at me w his head tilted. For a sec I thought a man was watching me bc I could make out a white shirt and his figure was def not female. But all while I was running thru these things in my mind, unbeknownst to me I was screaming non stop so much so that my mom rushed to my room. As soon as my mom touched me he literally whisped away like smoke or sand in the wind. This all happened at 6 am btw so no devil hour and such.

,Thetruthishere,"Tonight I had a strange experience out in the woods on the perimeter of my university campus and I'd love to have some second opinions on what could've been happening. At around 8:30 pm, my friends (2 others) and I decided to ditch our responsibilities for a while and go out on a walk around campus. We eventually found ourselves at the edge of the campus, where the forest begins. Collectively we all just shrugged and decided, why not take a walk in the forest?

The forest itself is really, really large, spanning several hundred acres, and we had walked pretty far once it started to rain more than we would've liked. My friends and I had all packed umbrellas, so we opened them up and decided to turn around and make the trip back to campus. On our way back, at about halfway out,  we heard a loud sobbing sound coming from several metres behind us. To me, it sounded like a woman drawing out her sobbing for a few seconds and then stopping. The sound wasn't coming from behind us on the dirt path we were walking on, rather from several metres behind us within the forest.

My friends and I had been walking with a phone flashlight pointed to the ground ahead of us, and upon hearing the crying sound, we sped up and walked faster to get **OUT OF THERE**. There would be a period of silence, then the sound would repeat, with each repeat coming up closer next to us (to our left, still within the forest). Each repeat of the sobbing sounded less distinctly like a person crying and more animal-like, which was concerning because it was seemingly following us. It also sounded like there were two sounds happening, one after the other, but ending at the same time. The sound repeated maybe 2 or 3 times, with the last call/cry we heard was about matched to where we were,  still metres away in the forest (parallel, not right directly beside us). I was on the leftmost side of the path and I kept my eyes on the woods the whole time as we sped walked OUT of there, but I wasn't able to see anything moving or trace where/what the sound was coming from.

Once we were out of the forest and far enough away that we were properly back on campus, I pulled out my phone to look up fox/coyote calls on youtube to see if anything sounded similar, but every clip I listened to sounded too dog-like. I'd say that the closest might've been some fox soundbites, but they sounded too high pitched and more like wailing than sobbing. I can't imagine that any animal would've wanted to tail us considering we were three people who were talking/laughing fairly loudly, with umbrellas open, and a bright light trained on the ground ahead of us. My friends shrugged the experience off and tried to rationalize it by saying that it was likely dogs out in the woods, but I know what we heard and I know that it definitely was not anyone's dog. No one would've been walking in the forest in the rain at 9 pm on a Monday (other than us crazies), so I really don't know what it could've been. I really wish I had taken my phone out earlier and recorded the noise as it was happening, but I'm not sure if I'd ever want to relive that again.",t2_kh5uayl,False,,0,False,Sobbing in the Forest,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,6,0,False,t3_fg9fzn,False,dark,,public,16,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Strange Sounds,False,16,,False,,1583821396.0,,[],{},,True,,1583849941.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight I had a strange experience out in the woods on the perimeter of my university campus and I&amp;#39;d love to have some second opinions on what could&amp;#39;ve been happening.

,Thetruthishere,"This takes place in Grand Rapids, Mi. 

About 18 years ago when I was 17-18 I was living across the state from Grand Rapids. I was a senior in high school and I had a lot of friends who had graduated and went to college. One weekend a friend and I decided to take a trip to see some of our friends and spend the weekend at their house. When we got there we realized the house was down a weird dead end street. It was like a normal city neighborhood but you could turn down this one almost not noticeable street that looked almost like an alley and there was like 5-10 houses down it and they were all in pretty bad shape. 

When we got there it was a really big and old like 5 bedroom house and there was a couple people living there and a couple people I was just meeting for the first time. We met and all got along and were having a good time. Then they started telling me about how weird the street was and how all the neighbors have been living there for a long time. So we started partying and my friend started telling me he loved living in the house but things were weird because he was a really curious dude and he said the landlord told them specifically when they moved in he knew they were gonna be partying a lot and just doing typical young college kid stuff. Then he starts telling me about the basement. 

He tells me after the landlord told him he didn’t care what they did the one rule he had in the house, and he was very adamant about this, was to never under any circumstances try not to open the doors in the basement. Obviously at this point my interest is piqued. So after a discussion we head down to the basement. 

To set this up visually... the basement was like one of those very old basements where everything is cement. It was super dirty and long and had big cement support pillars down the middle and there was nothing in it. Now on either side of the room there was doors. Big doors. And when I saw them my heart sank. 

Both doors had about 1000 nails in them. All over. Some of them were bent, some were sticking out. It looked like someone was frantically nailing this thing as shut as they could. Both of them. We discussed it for awhile and decided not to open the doors and honestly I really regret it. I still think about it from time to time. I have no idea what was behind them. We’ve discussed so many possibilities. Was it like an old well? But if so why would they be on both sides of the house? Was it maybe old tunnels? The house was really old. My the ultimate reason my friend didn’t want us opening the doors is because he was afraid a poltergeist was trapped or something, which I laughed off. 

I don’t even think the house is still there but I know they asked the landlord again what was behind the doors and all he would say is “just promise me you’ll never try and open them”",t2_3ut2p2ub,False,,0,False,Adamant landlord,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_ffxzsu,False,dark,,public,26,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,26,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583802725.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This takes place in Grand Rapids, Mi. &lt;/p&gt;

I found her running towards me from the other side of one of the chairs in the living room. I said “what happened?!” She was sobbing and grabbing onto me so I picked her up and said “what’s wrong?” 
She wouldn’t tell me so I just let her cry until she calmed down. We went to the room she snd her sister shared, and finally she told me she saw a face under the chair. 

I need to mention, I didn’t watch anything scary while the kids were around, nor did I allow them to watch anything considered scary. They were always with me unless they were at daycare and I was at work. 

I asked her what the face looked like. She furrowed her brow, grit and bared her teeth and twisted her nose up. The contortion she performed startled me. She had not made that face before. I said “ok, well, I’m going to go check and I promise you, I’ll take care of it, whatever I find.” 

I felt on edge but checked under all the chairs expecting for something to appear to me. I found nothing. I ended up calling my parents, who are religious, and the prayed for us. I did that to comfort the kids, but I believe my daughter must have seen something. 

Earlier that evening, BEFORE I went to pick up my kids from daycare, I got off early from work and went home to watch tv for a bit before going. I ended up watching ghost/paranormal videos. I shut it off before I left to get them.

,Thetruthishere,"A couple months ago me and my buddy were drinking at our friends house and we both decided we wanted to leave. Of course being the responsible guys we are we agreed to walk to my house and I would drive him to pick up his car in the morning. It was about 3am and pretty cold. I only had a sweatshirt on and was shivering a little bit.

At one point in the walk a cemetery was up about a quarter mile to the right. I looked up and saw a little girl with black hair running into the cemetery and immediately I told my friend to look but he looked too late and didn’t see her as she disappeared into the cemetery. I explained to him what I saw and obviously he thought I was crazy and just seeing things and wrote it off as I had a little too much to drink. 

Fast forward about 5 minutes later and we’re walking on the left side of the road with the cemetery to our right immediately next to the road. 

We’re just walking and talking but I couldn’t stop thinking about the little girl I saw running. She had no coat or sweatshirt and it was cold out. Just as I was about to stop thinking about it she pops out from a bush right next to the cemetery on the other side of the road. She popped out of the bush and sprinted down the road, I froze with fear and my friend immediately started laughing. I asked him why the fuck are you laughing and he said because I can’t believe my eyes right now. She kept running, pretty fast I may add and just like that she was gone. She didn’t disappear like a gosht or anything she just was too far away to see anymore maybe she hid in another bush i’m not sure. With that closer look we both had I noticed she had a long sleeve grey t-shirt on and jeans. The strange thing is that she was also barefoot.

,Thetruthishere,"A little background first. I am a sensitive and have seen ghosts, spirits, demons, unknown things. I currently have a 10 month old daughter. She’s been walking last few weeks pretty well and sooner than other babies around us. Her crib is still in our bedroom next to my side of the bed. It’s a proper crib with the mattress lowered so she can’t fall out and can stand up. There is a night light at the foot of her crib that is always on. 

It’s the middle of the night. We are all asleep. I wake up to something brush my face lightly..Felt like maybe air? Anyways, I open my eyes a little confused why I’m awake. I lightly hear my baby whispering and light laughing. I open my eyes and look around. I see her walking next to bed! Wobbly holding on the side of the bed and crib to balance. (She hasn’t had to hold on for a few weeks) I’m scared thinking she must have fallen out of her crib somehow and is hurt? Then I think maybe I slept in? And husband took her out and let her wake me? I’m starting to sit up and she starts walking back towards my way. Closer to the head of the crib. She keeps looking inside the crib excited and lightly laughing/whispering. I hear husband snoring behind me and realize somethings wrong. I sit up a little and get ready to pick her up to check her. Make sure she’s not hurt. However she’s escaped. That’s when i noticed! I could see her sleeping inside the crib!! I sit up all the way and throw my blanket off..the baby is now with its back to me at the head of the crib, I yell WTF?! It turns. Looks at me and walks into the wall. It had no face. Just a blur. Now I’m mad. And yell wtf again. Check my daughter. She’s fine. Sleeping. I get up bless the whole room with holy water. And go back to bed. Sleeping peacefully now I’m woken up again. Now there’s a light laugh and noise back again. By the foot of the crib again. I don’t see anything just feel it. I had enough of this shit. I got up, picked up my daughter n put her to sleep in the middle of us. Whatever that no face giggling thing was. I was Over it! Unless you have some lotto numbers don’t keep waking me up with no face. 

After speaking to a few elders. I was told it was just a friendly spirit nothing evil. That’s why it was allowed to enter even after being blessed. It just wanted to play and changed it’s form. That’s why it had no face. My daughter has been showing signs of being sensitive as well. Which I’ll save for another day.

Then one of my friends hears a weird distorted  talking from my other friends mic (sounds as if it's a plane's black box) (Keep in mind that my friend who's mic this is coming from can't hear this). when we listened to it it sounded as if the person said ""Plane 192""  or something among those lines.

At then end you can hear my friend laughing because my other friend told him something (You can't hear him in this recording)

They were both in a Discord call but they were silent for majority of the call. Then one of my friends hears a weird distorted  talking from my other friends mic (sounds as if it&amp;#39;s a plane&amp;#39;s black box) (Keep in mind that my friend who&amp;#39;s mic this is coming from can&amp;#39;t hear this). when we listened to it it sounded as if the person said &amp;quot;Plane 192&amp;quot;  or something among those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At then end you can hear my friend laughing because my other friend told him something (You can&amp;#39;t hear him in this recording)&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"I've had a couple of supernatural / paranormal experiences in my life but there is one that stands out from them all. When I was about 28 I was living in an apartment with a friend of mine. Things were great between us we got along so well and worked well as flatmates. One night we were pretty bored so we decided to go onto the Three Kings subreddit (r/threekings) and try to do a ritual. She was very much into the idea of it but I wasn't because she had no experience with magic or meditation or hypnotism or anything outside of the norm. So I can't remember which ritual it was but I'll describe it as best I can. So I had to hypnotise her which involved reading out a prewritten script, pretty much saying you are getting sleepy, very relaxed, even 10 times more relaxed etc. The thing is I actually hypnotised her. She fell into the hypnosis like instantly. Next there was the ritual part which involved meeting something hidden behind a door that will show her the future. So I was reading out another prewritten script of her walking down a hall looking at different doors, opening the doors and seeing whats on the other side. She described what was on the side doors as nothing, or white light. When she finally got to the door at the end of the hall she was very hesitant to open it. She opened the door and her face changed. A huge grimace came over her face, like a huge smile showing all of her teeth. Straight away I felt light something was wrong and I told her to come out of the hypnosis. But she didn't. She started speaking gibberish that I didnt understand and then finally she said ""He's here, he's here"" Over and over. And now this is where the next thing happens. The lamp next to her flickered a couple of times. It wasn't that intense but it totally freaked me out. I tried to talk to her slowly to wake up again, but she just sat there with her head down whispering gibberish. Suddenly she raised her head and looked at me with her own eyes again. ""What happened?"" She said. We talked into the night but.. she seemed different. Over the next few weeks she changed. She seemed quiet and distant, and got angry a couple of times which wasn't like her. Gradually she started to get better but she wasn't exactly the same again.

,Thetruthishere,"This happened literally MINUTES AGO and I’ll describe what happened. For context, I have two accounts I use, this one and (u/Baxteriscute). My account was banned from r/paranormal, due to the fact that they have terrible mods on it, who gave no warnings to anyone when they get banned. I had to use one, just to write my paranormal stories. 

Anyway, My dog, Baxter, recently passed away from stomach cancer in November, literally days from when he was diagnosed. He was a beautiful soft coated wheaten, and overall was a beautiful dog. He was quiet, he absolutely adored my mom, and he was generally, one of the best dogs to ever live, statistically speaking. 

When he passed, I would see him in a couple of my dreams (posted on this account) and I think he was just trying to say Hi. 

Story: Right now, it’s 3:32am, so I was just going downstairs to get some water, and when I turn the corner, I see him. It was a black shadow, almost physical, like an outline quite distinguished. He was sitting on the stairs, looking down at the kitchen. It took a moment, maybe 3 seconds before I turn on the hallway light, so I could see him for maybe 3-4 seconds. 
I ran downstairs to get a glass of water before scrambling up the steps. 

I have not had an experience like this in a while. At first it was my cat (who died in April) and now it’s my dog. CRAAAZZZY.

,Thetruthishere,"First I'd like to say I'm glad I found this sub because I never get to talk about this experiences, I'm 25, way past the age when you make up ghost stories, but there's no way of telling this kind of stuff without it looking that you are just lying, I can't even believe myself when talking about this.

I used to suffer from sleep paralysis a lot, it has always been terrifying, but there's just two instances where what happened was just completely out of normal.

The first time I was like 15 maybe, I was going through a face where I was starting to believe in God and was learning about him and reading the Bible. Sleep paralysis usually happens in the middle of the night, but this time it happened early in the morning, It was like my head was draged to the curtains by itself, and I could clearly see two red eyes, when I had sleep paralysis you could hear anything in particular, maybe a resemblance of shouts but nothing clear, this time was different. With a really unsettling voice the eyes were telling me to ""do it"", they told me do it over and over and over, I couldn't snap out of it for a really long time, I couldn't even talk back to it inside my mind or anything.

When it was over I was really sceptical about what had happened, part of me didn't believed it was real, and the other part trying to make sense out of it couldn't understand what was ""it"", I had no idea what this thing wanted me to do. I kept it for myself for a time, but later told my grandma, and asked her what she thought this thing wanted me to do, she advised me to not even try to learn what it wanted and just pray.

I had thought maybe I was a bit biased since I was reading the Bible for the first time, and maybe my mind made a demon for me, but the truth is, the devil is not very ""demonic"" in the Bible, yes he is mean beyond normal standards but he is never described in any way and when you read what he says he just sounds like a regular man making people or god question themselves, and the red eyes didn't mention anything about religion and I didn't took it that way, still maybe it had something to do with it if it was real.

The second time I saw them was 10 times more terrifying.
 I was working for a friend looking after her country house while her family was away, Iwas having a really hard time. The place was just enormous and had no way of stoping people form jumping the small grids, some places you could stick through without even jumping, and her family was rather wealthy, having a lot of valuables inside the house.

From the house to the nearest entrance must have been like a km, and there I learned woods are not like in the movies, take 5 steps away from the light the house gives you and it's pitch black, you won't see 1 meter in front of you and it was as if flash lights got their light sucked out of them, using them would only give you 3 more meters in one direction.

I was on the process of buying a gun when my friend forbid it, I don't live in the USA where people are ok with guns, she didn't like the idea of me killing someone who was just planning to steal a couple of oranges out of fear, I asked for a crossbow and she told me there wouldn't be any weapons in her house if I wanted to keep the job.

I used to sleep in her tv room (I was not allowed but that's another story) because I would play my PS4 there until I fell asleep, always with a knife bellow my pillow, one day I heard steps on the floor below, and to my bad look I had sleep paralysis as soon as they woke me up, I could here these cautious steps going up the stairs cracking without being able to move, later they got to my couch, I had my face covered with the blanket.

I was trying to reach my knife but I just couldn't move, later I swear for my life that the guy gently put the cover out of my face, I could stare at him at that point, it was really dark and couldn't see past his hoodie, he had the cap on. After like 2 seconds and the adrenaline just rushing I snapped out with hit but the guy just banished, it was as if it was made of a shadow out of smoke, I swear I could see the smoke  like for 2 or 3 seconds before it disappeared towards one of the two paintings upstairs.

I told this to my friend and asked her if the paintings had some story behind them. She kinda laughed it off, and told me they were old but that a friar and some fruit had nothing to do with people made out of smoke wearing clothes from the 21st century.

That was like 5 years ago, I haven't had a similar experience since then, and I truly hope I just don't.
I don't believe in this kind of stuff, I don't know if I convinced myself over the years or if it happened so long ago it just doesn't feel real anymore.

My first time posting but after reading so many of these kinds of things, I wanted to share. \n\nBackstory: my dad passed away in 2015. He was 64, so not super young, but it was a shock to us all because all 4 of my grandparents were still alive and well, and we obviously didn’t expect for him to die before them. So, My mom says that she felt like he was “still around” the house after he died, as she would see shadows, hear foot steps etc. I kind of chalked it to her just being alone now in a house where they used to be together. (I didn’t live there at the time, but did live there a couple years later in 2017-mid 2019) in 2017, her father, my Grampa, died as well. \noverall, she does believe in spirits and ghosts, etc and *used* to be quite Christian. She’s had paranormal experiences and is open minded but realistic.. her first guess isn’t always like “OHH GHOST!” She tried to figure it out logically before going to any paranormal conclusions as to not freak herself out. \n\nThe experience:\nIn late 2018, in the time i was living with her, I had a boyfriend who’s house I would stay at a few nights a week, as you do. She said that one night when I wasn’t there, she woke up in the middle of the night because she felt something was watching her. She opened her eyes and recalls a large shadowy face, with not super defined features but like a floating egg head with indents for eyes etc. No body. She flung herself out of bed, screaming, and threw a chair at it (scaring the shit out of my dog and cat who sleep in the bed with her. I don’t know if they sensed anything, I don’t think she can remember except when she screamed and got up they jumped up too). It disappeared into thin air. She turned on the lights and waited, but eventually fell back asleep. (Idk how she fell asleep after something like that lol)\n\nThe next night, she woke up again in the middle of the night, but this time to a glowing white orb above her in bed. She says it was the size of a pomelo. She, again, got scared and started screaming and kind of flailing her arms. The orb floated slowly out of the room, (unlike the face that just sort of dissipated). \nWhen I came home a couple days later, she told me what happened. I immediately was freaked out and also confused. What are these two things doing, battling!? Dark vs light? And so we went to a bruja shop, got crystals etc. (Yes we like crystals and believe in energy and all that) \n\nShe said things subsided for a while, but one night (again, as I was away for the night), she was getting ready for bed, and she said she felt a need to turn around while brushing her teeth so that she was facing the bedroom. When she turned, she saw a blurry gray man run and jump into the bed, like a dive into a pool, and disappear into it. She said it didn’t feel very malicious. She was spooked but still went to bed. \n\nThe next day, she told me about this third experience, and I freaked. I’m telling her to get a shaman in this house quick, especially as I’m set to be moving out of her house and kind of far away. So now she’s gonna be alone!? No, not on my watch!!!! \n\nShe’s done some work with this particular shaman before, so the shaman knows us and our family a bit. She does some reiki work as well over my mom, and gives her instructions on how to proceed and get the spirits out of our house. I do this ritual with her, and so far, she hasn’t had any more spirits around her room at night. \n\nSomething that the shaman said to her though has stuck with me ever since. My first guess when thinking about the entities coming to my mom at night, is that it was my dad (first black shadowy face) and then my Grampa (her dad, as the glowing orb). My dad and grandpa didn’t really get along. My grandpa was very protective of my mom, and never thought my dad was the best man for her. \n\nBut then I’m thinking, why would my dad be a dark shadowy face? It unfortunately makes sense, even though I would like it not to. He was a difficult man, and in his opinion, was going to finish life too soon. He wasn’t ready to go. \n\nLet’s go back to the shaman. She practices some past life guided meditations, and in her reiki work with my mom, told her that my dad was essentially stuck to her. Why? Because they had many past lives together. Cute, right? No. Fuck no. Apparently, in every past life before this one, he had out-lived her..... and the shaman said he had basically done anything to remain the survivor. So killed her, let her die, etc. The shaman said she saw it all there, and that he couldn’t let Go of my mom in this life because he was pissed that he went first. \nI honestly wish I could be like, nah that’s crazy. Dad wouldn’t kill mom, hurt her, or haunt her, etc. But the fucked part is that I can totally see  it. It makes sense to me. It hurts my heart to admit that but I can see my dad being someone who puts himself before everyone else.. he didn’t think he deserved to die. He even admitted once to my mom as she was taking care of him throughout his sickness that if the tables were turned, he probably wouldn’t have stuck around to take care of her. 😑 \n\nAnyways. What do you think?? Shadow man? Angel/demon? And who the hell jumped into her bed!? (She said it wasn’t my dad.) \n\nSorry this was so long. But it’s been something I’ve been thinking about and dealing with for the past 4 years 😓 \n\nTL;DR: my mom was haunted, I think it was my dad haunting her, and my deceased grandpa is trying to protect her from my dads darkness.', 'author_fullname': 't2_55y8ohuu', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'My dead dad is haunting my mom', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Haunting'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Paranormal', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'd', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fd2q6e', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 17, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Haunting', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 17, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583303106.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.Paranormal', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all.

I was attempting to fall asleep, when I hear whispering in the corner of my bedroom. Now, I have a large air conditioner outside on my patio, but this whispering was loud enough to physically hear overtop the loud noises of the conditoner. Two voices, maybe female, maybe male, but couldn’t distinctively understand them, which would’ve gave me a clue if they were female/male.
I’m never prepared for these situations, so when I’m scared, I immediately turn on my light and read a book to get my mind off of things, and it helps me sleep.

The next happened in October. 
My dog (rip Baxter) was on my bed, sleeping. I was attempting to fall asleep as well, when I hear static electricity on my bedroom carpet. Like ZZZ. I was kinda scared, when I began to hear heavy breathing, as if you ran for a maybe 10-15mins non-stop. Me, being the skeptic I was, put my ear to my dog’s face, cause I know my dog can sometimes breath quite loudly. 
My whole body went stone cold. 

The heavy breathing was louder than my dog’s breathing, and I could hear it overlap. NOPE, NOT AGAIN! I pulled my string light as fast as I could, and IT STILL WAS HAPPENING, keep in mind, this is at the FOOT OF MY BED, very, very close. 

I began reading fast, heart pounding like I’ve never had before. Scrolling through the pages, the heavy breathing slowly, but surely, disappeared. 

A few nights after, I heard heavy footsteps downstairs, like my dad’s footwear, but I knew my dad was asleep, cause I could hear his snoring. My brother was on his phone in his room, or asleep, so he was home, and not away, so it couldn’t have been him.

,Thetruthishere," I am sharing this wherever I think would make sense .. So here goes.

I have lived in my apartment for 3 years now and other than things falling randomly that I would usually blame on my cats I have never experienced anything paranormal. My boyfriend claims to see white lights at night in our bed room but i don't know , I feel there is always a logical explanation for things.

Yesterday I felt particularly ""spooked"" in my apartment I felt like someone was behind me , like I felt a presence . But also I am a fat baby when it comes to these things so I never take myself seriously . Anyway this is where It gets weird. That night my phone rang I was expecting a call from my best friend. So I pick up and say hello. And what I heard was a doll like voice laughing and giggling . She has a 1  year old daughter who does not sound like that but I just assumed it was her , so i was like ""awww hi "" all the while being creeped the f out and wondering what her daughter who goes to bed at 8 was up at 12 am. Then it quickly cut to my friend and she was like "" Was that you ? what are you doing ? tell me you are joking with me ."" I felt the blood leave my face . I was like "" no what did you hear"" thinking she heard the same thing or maybe some static. She was in shock she told me she heard a demonic man voice say ""hellooooooooooooo"" clearly and then cut to me saying hello. We spent the next few minutes arguing as she thought I was joking with her and I thought she was joking with me (even though she is not the type of person to do something like that ) . We established that it could have just been a weird glitch or something and left it at that.

I am so spooked from this lmao. Has anyone experienced something like this ? I never heard a sound like that in my life other than maybe in movies. I'm glad she heard something too because I feel like no one would have believed me .

,Thetruthishere,"So, sometimes my mind goes blank then my reflexes increase, my strength sky-rockets, my accuracy sky-rockets, and my hunting skills improve. Also, I remember everything when this happens and can control it and myself perfectly.

Example of hunting skills improving: I can track anything without having to look at them. I also can sense where people are around me and know details about them. I've named it Hunting Mode. Plus, I become very intimidating.

Examples of reflexes improving: I can block something from hitting me without even knowing it was there. I blocked my sister from hitting me from behind without knowing she was going to do it.

Example of accuracy improving: When I wanted to throw a pen at my sister to aggravate her. So, when her back was turned I decided to throw it at the back of her head. The only reason why it didn't hit her head is because she moved the last second. I was at least twenty feet away from her, and I was able to activate the ""Hunting Mode""

Example of strength improving: I was practicing using it then, my friend wanted to try to intimidate me by grabbing my shirt while getting in my face. So, I pushed him back and almost made him fall. I'm not usually strong enough to do that because he is a big guy.

Example of becoming intimidating: My friend doesn't like it when people push him, so he would usually become furious. That time he seemed horrified of me. Also, when I decided to look at myself in the mirror while doing it, it felt like it was tearing my mind apart. My eyes also looked like it was empty or there was just an endless, and empty abyss there.

Example of sensing people around me: My mind went blank and my head slowly rotated to where another person was in a car next to me. Even though I couldn't see the person there, I knew there was someone there, and I knew every detail about them. When I did see who it was in the car I was right about there gender, age and where they were located in the car (those are the only ones I could verify).

Can someone tell me what this is? I would appreciate all the help I can get on figuring out what this is. Is this like a predatory instinct, possession, some type of entity, or something?",t2_5oz2n0mo,False,,0,False,What is this?,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,,0,False,t3_ff5wk6,False,dark,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583663031.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, sometimes my mind goes blank then my reflexes increase, my strength sky-rockets, my accuracy sky-rockets, and my hunting skills improve. Also, I remember everything when this happens and can control it and myself perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of hunting skills improving: I can track anything without having to look at them. I also can sense where people are around me and know details about them. I&amp;#39;ve named it Hunting Mode. Plus, I become very intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of reflexes improving: I can block something from hitting me without even knowing it was there. I blocked my sister from hitting me from behind without knowing she was going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of accuracy improving: When I wanted to throw a pen at my sister to aggravate her. So, when her back was turned I decided to throw it at the back of her head. The only reason why it didn&amp;#39;t hit her head is because she moved the last second. I was at least twenty feet away from her, and I was able to activate the &amp;quot;Hunting Mode&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of strength improving: I was practicing using it then, my friend wanted to try to intimidate me by grabbing my shirt while getting in my face. So, I pushed him back and almost made him fall. I&amp;#39;m not usually strong enough to do that because he is a big guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of becoming intimidating: My friend doesn&amp;#39;t like it when people push him, so he would usually become furious. That time he seemed horrified of me. Also, when I decided to look at myself in the mirror while doing it, it felt like it was tearing my mind apart. My eyes also looked like it was empty or there was just an endless, and empty abyss there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of sensing people around me: My mind went blank and my head slowly rotated to where another person was in a car next to me.

,Thetruthishere,"Hi there! I just recently got this subreddit recommended to me by my phone and I thought I'd share some of my own experiences. You don't have to know absolutely everything about me but in my relatively short lifetime I've had some strange encounters. 2 years ago I moved from a relatively small village to a larger city, though in a pretty bad neighbourhood. And in these 2 years I've had the most haunting experiences I've ever had in any home I've lived in. Now as a bored teen I've practise and still practise some 'odd' hobbies like Tulpamancy and things related to that. And I know I'm not the most 100% sane person. However ever since the summer of 2019 I've heard strange noises coming from my neighbourhood and have seen strange lights in the skies. (I'll explain more about those lights in another post though. I've got them on video and camera). 
It started with odd clicking noises that would go on for a good 30 seconds to a minute before stopping and then returning later, with no set interval. It would usually be more than an hour, sometimes even 2 hours between the first clicking noises and the second clicking noises. And they would always start when it was about to turn pitch black outside. The sound was comparable to somebody taking a series of fast pictures or a fast camera shutter that was quite loud. It sounded eerily similar to one of the beasts from early videos from TheSunVanished oddly enough and when I first started hearing it I had a minor breakdown cause when I looked outside I also witnessed a red light while the sound was playing. But I've since debunked that light as just being a light from one of the neighbours backyards. That sound remained unanswered though.

It remained till around October-November when it dissapeared as suddenly as it initially appeared and was quickly replaced by a sound that would haunt my nights. A demonic screaming that hasn't stopped till this day. It's rather soft so It doesn't echo much further than my neighbourhood probably and usually appeares around 30 minutes before midnight and keeps going till around midnight. Occasionally I hear it way later at night aswell but that's a rare occurance. I have no clue what the source is and I'm unsure if I really want to know at this point. But luckily I haven't been attacked by anything demonic (directly). And I've grown somewhat used to it now.
I've asked my mom about these noises and she said she's never heard them directly. However she has been woken up by the rattleing and shaking of our backyard garden fence, this could all just be the wind aswell however. Near the end of 2019 our backyard fence gate got ripped out of its seem aswell. I've passed it off as the wind aswell just being to powerfull for the old gate however. My stepfather did quickly replace it with an all new fence while the old fence was suposedly ok, but he's done similar things before so it's not out of the ordinary.

What do you think? I'd be thrilled to read what you guys think of this and if you guys want to hear more of my personal experiences. Like the getho sky lights or my personal experiences as somebody with headmates and more. But for now I need to go to bed as work continues as normal in these trying Corona times.

,Thetruthishere,"Nightmares and weird noises

So for some background, I moved into a new apartment back in mid January. The apartment we moved into were older but had just been renovated and were super homey feeling and cozy. I honestly love my apartment and have no issues with it at all, no creepy vibes,  actually I feel super at peace there. The problem started last weekend, I went to sleep around 9 on Saturday and was woken up around 11:30 by the sound of someone stomping up the stairs of the apartment next to me. I looked outside, no neighbors car, thought it was weird but whatever and went to sleep. Starting from then every hour I would have a nightmare, wake up and see it was an hour from when I had went to sleep, and this repeated every hour until 4am when I would last until I woke up for work. This repeated almost down to the minute for 4 days . The only break i had was Wednesday when I stayed up till 12 and there was no stair noise and when I went sleep no nightmares at all. Last night I laid down around 9, wife as well. 11:30 came and there came the noise, just as some insight the neighbor has not been home in like 2 weeks, not sure why. I heard the noise, looked at my wife to tell her but she did not wake up. Went back to sleep and there’s a nightmare again, I woke up at 12:40 and more annoyed than anything, decided to stay awake till after 3 and then laid down.

,Thetruthishere,"So like 2 nights ago, it was around 1am and I heard someone coming down the stairs. I thought it was my mom so I pretended to sleep while I listened to my door very slowly but loudly crack open. (It’s pitch dark in my room so I can only feel and hear everything it does) as soon as it comes in, it comes up to me and rubbed something that felt like a jacket on my face for about 5 seconds. It chills there for a second before walking to the foot of my bed and I think it was literally just standing there. But then it goes to the other side of my bed (to my back) and lays on the very edge of my bed for maybe 5 minutes. Then it gets up and starts going through my closet and I got so confused when I could hear it rustling through the hiding spot in it, but it did that for another 5 minutes until it came back around to the other side of my bed and started searching under my pillow or something. Only for a minute before it sat on the bed beside me (I’m not sure but I think I heard a sigh) for only a minute, then it actually lays right beside me, like I can feel it solidly against me. It stayed there for about 3 minutes, but then I heard my mom walking upstairs in her room, and that’s when I got really fucking scared, but that’s not even the worst part. 5 seconds after hearing my mom upstairs, another one walks up to me from my door and crouches down beside me. Then I be like “yo wtf”, turn my phone on for a light and nothing is there.

Edit: I forgot to mention how I am constantly being bothered by it now, literally rnrn

Update: another freaky ass fucking thing that happened was yesterday, my mom came into my room to pray (she’s Christian) for something I can’t remember. But the entire time I was sitting there with my eyes closed, I could feel one of them standing in front of me, pacing back and forth. Sometimes I can hear an actual footstep, this shit has been getting so fucked, whatever this ghost wants, it wants it bad because it reeeallyy isn’t scared in the slightest of me knowing it’s there (though that could be my own fault, as I haven’t been doing anything to ward it off, and maybe even been more welcoming).

,Thetruthishere," For context, I'm a girl and the major part of this story happened when I was in 8th grade. I  lived in the same house from the age of 4 until I turned 21. It was a  duplex, meaning there were two houses on the same  property, with a  large backyard. Our property manager had turned part of his garage into a  small bedroom and had rented it out to a man.

My  family moved in to the home closest to the backyard when I was 4. My  dad being the friendly guy he is, made friends with the man living in  the small bedroom across from our home. This man was older, maybe in his  late 40's or early 50's. Always reeked of alcohol and cigarettes, wore  glasses, and had crooked teeth. The works.

Over  the years, he'd watch me closely, in a creepy way. He'd only leave his  door cracked open, about an inch, and I'd see his glasses gleam as he  watched me play with friends or by myself. He would always try to tempt  me to come to him with money or candy.

As  I got older, I started inviting my middle school friends to my home. A  few of them would comment on the weird man staring at us. I remember a  time where I said ""He's staring at us again."" and one of my guy friends  responded with ""He's not staring at us, he's watching YOU.""

My best friend, and yes she is the same best friend I've been mentioning in my last two stories. We'll call her Karin.

Karin  and I had been super invested in Naruto, we'd always watch it on our  spare time together. One of the characters Jiraiya, was a super pervert  who would lurk around women, Naruto called him pervy sage. So we started  calling the creepy old man Pervy Sage as well. (Sorry Jiraiya.)

Late  one night maybe around 8pm or 9pm, when i was about 13 or 14, Karin and I were in my dining  room area, sitting at the computer with my dog on my lap. My parents  were at work, my older brothers were in their room(they share the master  bedroom). They were hanging out with their friends.

I  recall hearing my front door open but not thinking much of it. That's  until I smelled the stench of cigarettes and alcohol, we looked to our  left and saw him inside my home. But neither of us said anything, Karin  and I were both in shock. He walked up to us and stood behind me. He  began to play with my hair asking what we were doing. Karin and I just  sat there, not knowing what to say, he knew my parents weren't home. She  blurted out we were ordering pizza online and typed in Pizza Hut on the  search bar. She later told me if we ordered pizza a grown up would come  and we could tell him/her what was wrong.

The  man did not budge, he continued to play with my hair. Karin got up and  nervously said ""I'm gonna ask your brothers if they want anything on  their pizza"" and with that she ran to her right, straight down the  hallway, and bolted through my brothers' door.

I had just finalized the pizza purchase and heard her scream ""Pervy Sage is acting weird!""

The  man spoke only spanish, I doubt he knew what she said, but with that I  grabbed my dog and ran towards my brothers room and repeated it. ""Pervy  sage is acting weird!""

Both Karin  and I were blurting out how weird he weird was being and how he came in  uninvited. I can imagine, we both  looked hysterical. My brothers, told us to get the fuck out of their room.

I'm  not sure if they were trying to look cool in front of their friends but  I knew how they were, if I didn't do as they asked, I'd get beat up or  told off. Karin and I looked at each other sort of defeated, we closed  their bedroom door and stood in front of it for a second.

We looked back where we originally sat but the man was not there. Karin  and I ran to the kitchen, grabbed two knives and ran into my bedroom and  locked the door. She sat on the bed with my dog and I sat on the floor,  trying to listen or feel if he was walking around my house. My house  was old, it would easily shake when someone walked around, so I felt if I  sat on the floor I'd feel it if he were inside.

My  bedroom had two doors... One with a lock that connected to the hallway.  The other, with no lock, connected to my parents room, which was right  next to the front door of the house.

Karin  and I heard his footsteps in the living room once more then silence. We both  looked at each other in horror. We both rushed to the second door and  pushed against it just in time to stop him from opening it. The man  pushed for about 30 seconds before stopping. The moment he stopped Karin  and I took the opportunity to push a dresser into the door to barricade  it.

About  15 minutes of us sitting on my bed, knives in hand,  we heard the pizza guy arrive. With that the man was gone, back in his  hole of a bedroom, outside my home. We locked the front door and ate our  pizza.

We didn't call police,  because of where we lived, we thought 'who'd believe two kids?'. A few  days later Karin and I reported everything to our school counselor, she  was an amazing caring woman, she was always there for us no matter what  we needed, so we trusted her enough to tell her what had happened. She made a full report,  and interviewed us  both separately to make sure we weren't lying.

She called us both into her office the next day and let us know she had called police to report the incident but they  told her ""We cannot do anything until something happens.""

Karin was furious, ""are we supposed to be found dead in a ditch for them do something?"" I can still hear her saying this to this day.

Our  counselor called our parents to report the incident. Karin's parent's  didn't seem to care, their divorce was more important. My dad asked me  if it was true and said he'd talk to the guy. My brothers came to me  saying ""if he comes near you tell us."" all of a sudden they cared.

My  dad remained friends with the man. The man stopped talking to me for years but  never stopped watching. When I was 16, Karin and I were hanging out near  the front of the property, the man had ridden his bike near us and said  ""You're attitude has changed."" (in spanish) This was the first time he said anything to me since the event two to three years prior. So I told him ""I'm not a  kid anymore, I know what you are, and I can fight back."" Karin glared at  him. He moved away shortly after that.

Karin  and I lost touch after he moved away, we both went to different high  schools and for the first two years we tried our hardest to remain in  contact, but we grew apart. That and her mom had her moving from place  to place after the divorce.

I grew up with trust issues around men due to that man. Just something I'm slowly trying to get over.

I'm  24 now, the last time I saw him I was in my dad's car and he was riding his bike down the street, but that was back when I was about 18.

My parents  were at work, my older brothers were in their room(they share the master  bedroom). They were hanging out with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  recall hearing my front door open but not thinking much of it. That&amp;#39;s  until I smelled the stench of cigarettes and alcohol, we looked to our  left and saw him inside my home. But neither of us said anything, Karin  and I were both in shock. He walked up to us and stood behind me. He  began to play with my hair asking what we were doing. Karin and I just  sat there, not knowing what to say, he knew my parents weren&amp;#39;t home. She  blurted out we were ordering pizza online and typed in Pizza Hut on the  search bar. She later told me if we ordered pizza a grown up would come  and we could tell him/her what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  man did not budge, he continued to play with my hair. Karin got up and  nervously said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna ask your brothers if they want anything on  their pizza&amp;quot; and with that she ran to her right, straight down the  hallway, and bolted through my brothers&amp;#39; door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just finalized the pizza purchase and heard her scream &amp;quot;Pervy Sage is acting weird!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  man spoke only spanish, I doubt he knew what she said, but with that I  grabbed my dog and ran towards my brothers room and repeated it. &amp;quot;Pervy  sage is acting weird!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Karin  and I were blurting out how weird he weird was being and how he came in  uninvited. I can imagine, we both  looked hysterical. My brothers, told us to get the fuck out of their room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m  not sure if they were trying to look cool in front of their friends but  I knew how they were, if I didn&amp;#39;t do as they asked, I&amp;#39;d get beat up or  told off. Karin and I looked at each other sort of defeated, we closed  their bedroom door and stood in front of it for a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked back where we originally sat but the man was not there. Karin  and I ran to the kitchen, grabbed two knives and ran into my bedroom and  locked the door. She sat on the bed with my dog and I sat on the floor,  trying to listen or feel if he was walking around my house. My house  was old, it would easily shake when someone walked around, so I felt if I  sat on the floor I&amp;#39;d feel it if he were inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My  bedroom had two doors... One with a lock that connected to the hallway.  The other, with no lock, connected to my parents room, which was right  next to the front door of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karin  and I heard his footsteps in the living room once more then silence. We both  looked at each other in horror. We both rushed to the second door and  pushed against it just in time to stop him from opening it. The man  pushed for about 30 seconds before stopping. The moment he stopped Karin  and I took the opportunity to push a dresser into the door to barricade  it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About  15 minutes of us sitting on my bed, knives in hand,  we heard the pizza guy arrive. With that the man was gone, back in his  hole of a bedroom, outside my home. We locked the front door and ate our  pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t call police,  because of where we lived, we thought &amp;#39;who&amp;#39;d believe two kids?&amp;#39;. A few  days later Karin and I reported everything to our school counselor, she  was an amazing caring woman, she was always there for us no matter what  we needed, so we trusted her enough to tell her what had happened. She made a full report,  and interviewed us  both separately to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t lying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She called us both into her office the next day and let us know she had called police to report the incident but they  told her &amp;quot;We cannot do anything until something happens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karin was furious, &amp;quot;are we supposed to be found dead in a ditch for them do something?&amp;quot; I can still hear her saying this to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our  counselor called our parents to report the incident. Karin&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s  didn&amp;#39;t seem to care, their divorce was more important. My dad asked me  if it was true and said he&amp;#39;d talk to the guy. My brothers came to me  saying &amp;quot;if he comes near you tell us.&amp;quot; all of a sudden they cared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My  dad remained friends with the man. The man stopped talking to me for years but  never stopped watching. When I was 16, Karin and I were hanging out near  the front of the property, the man had ridden his bike near us and said  &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re attitude has changed.&amp;quot; (in spanish) This was the first time he said anything to me since the event two to three years prior. So I told him &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not a  kid anymore, I know what you are, and I can fight back.&amp;quot; Karin glared at  him. He moved away shortly after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karin  and I lost touch after he moved away, we both went to different high  schools and for the first two years we tried our hardest to remain in  contact, but we grew apart. That and her mom had her moving from place  to place after the divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up with trust issues around men due to that man. Just something I&amp;#39;m slowly trying to get over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m  24 now, the last time I saw him I was in my dad&amp;#39;s car and he was riding his bike down the street, but that was back when I was about 18. I haven&amp;#39;t seen him since.&lt;/p&gt;

The familiar chime rang out, reverberating off the cement block walls as the elevator doors slid open. In the months we’d been living in the building, we’d only rarely shared the elevator with anyone else, but this time there was a woman on the lift already. She didn’t acknowledge our presence as we got on the elevator with her, she just stood there in the back corner, expressionless. I reached in front of her to press the button to take us down to the ground floor. The buttons for the 5th and 6th floors were illuminated as though they had already been pressed, as was the button for the basement. The doors slid closed and the elevator cables began to creak and groan as they pulled us upwards. The elevator stopped on the 5th floor and with a chime the silence filling the space was broken and the doors opened. There was no one there waiting to get on, and the woman in the corner made no move to exit the elevator. I looked over my shoulder at Matt; we shared a look of mild confusion, but didn’t think much of it. Perhaps the woman had accidentally pressed the buttons for both floors; a simple mistake. After a moment the doors closed again and we were hoisted the rest of the way up to the 6th floor. Another chime and the doors slid open. Again, no one was there; again the woman made no move to exit. Nervous laughter escaped me as I glanced over at the woman. She remained expressionless, her eyes almost lifeless; she looked dull, there was no lustre to her hair or skin. She was elderly and wore a long winter coat, a fur hat, and boots - clean and fashionable, but dated. She hadn’t moved an inch since we stepped onto the elevator 2 floors ago. She didn’t shift her weight from one side to the other, she didn’t adjust her grip on the bag she was carrying, she didn’t make a sound. A sense of dread washed over me - I didn’t want to spend another second on the lift with this strange woman. I wanted to exit the elevator right there on the 6th floor and take the stairs down. I looked at Matt and I could tell he was on the same page, but before we could make our move, the doors closed again. The elevator began its descent, the cables creaking as we were lowered towards the ground. The display above the elevator doors flashed the numbers for each floor as we passed them. 5 - 4 - 3 - 2.. as we finally reached the ground floor, the elevator shuddered as it came to a stop. There was a long pause before the familiar chime finally rang out and the doors slid open. We got off the elevator as fast as we could, not taking the time to look back at the woman in the corner. She did not exit the elevator with us. We could only assume she took the lift the rest of the way down to the basement. We hurried out of the building and across the parking lot to the car.

,Thetruthishere,"Hello all!

As I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/f9ziia/will_soon_possess_a_haunted_dollsuggestions_for/) I now possess a potentially haunted doll. I promised I would post an update, and so, here we are. 

Doll in containment: [Here](https://i.imgur.com/EoP73VW.jpg)

It's under 24/7 watch. The camera does motion detection, and also takes a still image every single minute. It alerts me to motion and also records 15 seconds before, and after the motion as a separate video.

Currently, he resides in a large glass jar. After speaking to a few different people, it was suggested I start small. Glass is made from sand, so a fully glass jar is ""akin to burying it"". For now, I felt that was a good start, and will increase as needed.

This was also suggested because if I start strong, the entity may see that as a challenge.

The two black boxes, one on each side: These are mini EMF detectors.

They glow blue as seen in this short video: [Video](https://i.imgur.com/OVnnApp.mp4)

They are pretty sensitive and will react to EMF even from across the room. For example, when my cat runs across the carpet, that little bit of static will make them react if they are within about 5 feet. They glow brighter, the stronger the EMF.

These two pictures should explain how they are helping with the investigation:

[One](https://i.imgur.com/jd5PbMJ.jpg)

[Two](https://i.imgur.com/vpe4jvZ.jpg)

In the first image, you can see the constant small glow they give off while next to the jar. Not even touching the jar.

The second image shows one of them moved to the wall, away from the jar by two inches, and is no longer glowing. You will see the left one is still glowing. I have a bunch of these that I use to make a circle, or other design, around investigation areas. It helps track the movement of entities/energy.

I have done one Spirit Box session, and one EVP session so far, but have received no contact. I did a reading with a separate EMF detector, and it gave me a strong reading at first, but then it stopped a moment or two later.

I will, of course, update more in the future when/if anything else happens.

No nightmares so far!

Someone below asked about my prior experiences, and I uploaded some old EVPs and recordings I did. Here is the comment, and my reply with the link:

&gt;Damn how was living in a haunted house? Did it scare you? And what kind of voice was there? Those over nights sound intense. That would’ve been fucking awesome. And damn that’s dope how you got the doll. Do they have big over night hunt events? So many questions lol.

You know, it's kinda funny really. My friends and family kept telling me all these ghost stories, and I just never really experienced anything, despite being a believer. I never heard the footsteps, I never saw things move.

In 2008, we had a kitchen fire, and the second floor took so much smoke damage that my brother and I ended up having to sleep in the living room. The back wall had a large opening for the kitchen, that went along to the bathroom as well. As I was laying there, late one night, I saw a swirling mass of colors exit the boarded up kitchen, walk along the wall, and into the bathroom.

At that time I was experimenting with astral projection, and hypnogogic imagery, so I assumed it was that. The next morning, my brother asked me ""Did you see the lady in white?""

I asked him what he meant, and he said he woke up around 3am, and saw a woman in a white dress come out of the kitchen, walk down the wall, and into the bathroom.

----

After that, I started hearing little noises, little taps. I heard my name said a few times. I started recording, and caught EVPs, two of which are my name, and two being longer sentences. One saying my name freaked the ever living fuck out of me, so I stopped recording. It wasn't that it was my name, but HOW it was said.

So, I was using an app called 'sleepbot' that records noises while you sleep. Fun for hearing you snore, ya know?

In order to use it, you leave it on the bed around your head, and if you move, it captures that as well.

Around 5am, I was half awake, and I swore I heard something. I rolled over, grabbed my phone, and hit stop. I then hit play on the last 30 seconds...it was my name, but it WASN'T an EVP in my opinion. I hear the entity take a deep breath, and say my name, before drawing more air through it's teeth. But as it says my name, wind goes over the microphone of of the phone. Just a foot from my head. (Uploaded the recordings to drive for your enjoyment: [EVP/Recordings](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1YEciZ0QwCqsjP_xdegOIuaSuvq3Ui_YH) (Uploaded to Mega.nz as well since some are having issues downloaded from google drive) [Here](https://mega.nz/#!Kt8FFaiL!IqFp9_Nx4MJZmfJQQtcCcfBWXItwTP9_KZPLMVyD4d8)

I heard it, and immediately got the fuck up. Ended up spending the rest of the morning in the kitchen smoking with all the lights on. I stopped recording after that, as it was clear I was getting too close.

After my experiences years later in bank repossession work, I renewed my interest.

To answer the final question, yes, both of those do public and private ghost hunts.",t2_bekyn,False,,0,False,The Doll Has Arrived...Follow up as promised!,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,pic,0,False,t3_fd57z5,False,dark,,public,664,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Picture/Evidence,False,664,,False,,1583348163.0,,[],{},,True,,1583313811.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked him what he meant, and he said he woke up around 3am, and saw a woman in a white dress come out of the kitchen, walk down the wall, and into the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I started hearing little noises, little taps. I heard my name said a few times. I started recording, and caught EVPs, two of which are my name, and two being longer sentences. One saying my name freaked the ever living fuck out of me, so I stopped recording. It wasn&amp;#39;t that it was my name, but HOW it was said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was using an app called &amp;#39;sleepbot&amp;#39; that records noises while you sleep. Fun for hearing you snore, ya know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use it, you leave it on the bed around your head, and if you move, it captures that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 5am, I was half awake, and I swore I heard something. I rolled over, grabbed my phone, and hit stop. I then hit play on the last 30 seconds...it was my name, but it WASN&amp;#39;T an EVP in my opinion. I hear the entity take a deep breath, and say my name, before drawing more air through it&amp;#39;s teeth. But as it says my name, wind goes over the microphone of of the phone. Just a foot from my head. (Uploaded the recordings to drive for your enjoyment: &lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1YEciZ0QwCqsjP_xdegOIuaSuvq3Ui_YH""&gt;EVP/Recordings&lt;/a&gt; (Uploaded to Mega.nz as well since some are having issues downloaded from google drive) &lt;a href=""https://mega.nz/#!Kt8FFaiL!IqFp9_Nx4MJZmfJQQtcCcfBWXItwTP9_KZPLMVyD4d8""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard it, and immediately got the fuck up. Ended up spending the rest of the morning in the kitchen smoking with all the lights on. I stopped recording after that, as it was clear I was getting too close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my experiences years later in bank repossession work, I renewed my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the final question, yes, both of those do public and private ghost hunts.&lt;/p&gt;

,Thetruthishere,"4 days ago my older sister and I were watching the Avs vs Panthers game, lightly drinking for boosted excitement watching the Avs make franchise history.

I slept not long after that bc I got so tired then woke up a little before 4:00 a.m. I’m scrolling through reddit when suddenly I’m hit with this immense fear.

I go to the living room bc I can’t stand being in the last room anymore and plus my sister was also sleeping in the living room and there was only us 2 and her 4 little kiddos. 

I keep feeling this fear like something is waiting for just the right moment to jump scare me and I’m seriously thinking I should commit suicide cause that’s how scared I was. I want to cry, or wake my sister up but if she fell back asleep it would only scare me even more.  I can’t go back to sleep either bc every time I close my eyes it’s like the presence gets stronger and I feel like I’m going to die. I would have fallen asleep easily laying on my back but I deal with sleep paralysis so there’s just no way.

I’m scared but don’t know what to do. I think about climbing out the window and walking home but it was so dark. 
I decide to wait til it gets light outside maybe I’ll be more comfortable in closing my eyes. 

I keep hearing house noises that makes my heartbeat pick up pace. Shadows I see from the sides of my eyes that make me wish I could just be dead already. 

My stomach is hurting and I’m trying to hold in my insides cause I don’t want to go to the bathroom and puke. 

In all the fear is everywhere and I feel so little against it.

When it starts to lighten up outside and it’s close to the kiddies waking up I start to feel comfortable and let my guard down. Bad mistake, I start to hear this weird sound like something heavy being dragged. I look around trying to figure out where it’s coming from when all of a sudden the blanket that covers the front door (bc I live in a cold area and it’s winter here) pushes up and the front door opens. I swear to god my soul left my body at that moment, I’m so scared but I go close the door then go lay next to my sister under the blanket til she wakes up, when she does I go straight to sleep.

Later that day after I wake up my sister told me Branden a.k.a “big so” passed away, I don’t even know the guy but apparently he passed away of suicide downing bottles of pills.

&lt;p&gt;I slept not long after that bc I got so tired then woke up a little before 4:00 a.m. I’m scrolling through reddit when suddenly I’m hit with this immense fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to the living room bc I can’t stand being in the last room anymore and plus my sister was also sleeping in the living room and there was only us 2 and her 4 little kiddos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep feeling this fear like something is waiting for just the right moment to jump scare me and I’m seriously thinking I should commit suicide cause that’s how scared I was. I want to cry, or wake my sister up but if she fell back asleep it would only scare me even more.  I can’t go back to sleep either bc every time I close my eyes it’s like the presence gets stronger and I feel like I’m going to die. I would have fallen asleep easily laying on my back but I deal with sleep paralysis so there’s just no way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m scared but don’t know what to do. I think about climbing out the window and walking home but it was so dark. 
I decide to wait til it gets light outside maybe I’ll be more comfortable in closing my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing house noises that makes my heartbeat pick up pace. Shadows I see from the sides of my eyes that make me wish I could just be dead already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stomach is hurting and I’m trying to hold in my insides cause I don’t want to go to the bathroom and puke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the fear is everywhere and I feel so little against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it starts to lighten up outside and it’s close to the kiddies waking up I start to feel comfortable and let my guard down. Bad mistake, I start to hear this weird sound like something heavy being dragged. I look around trying to figure out where it’s coming from when all of a sudden the blanket that covers the front door (bc I live in a cold area and it’s winter here) pushes up and the front door opens. I swear to god my soul left my body at that moment, I’m so scared but I go close the door then go lay next to my sister under the blanket til she wakes up, when she does I go straight to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

So Ive said this before please forgive my structsring with writing.

During the summer after finishing my freshman year a few buddies and I were just hanging out all day into the next morning(around 3 to 4 am) we decided to stay at my place that night to play games and watch tv. So arounf 3 or 4 am we decide to head down to the basement to sleep since we had a reclinging couch and a love seat. Well I was ready to sleep but my 2 friends were not so they kept talking and trying to get me into the conversation. So while we sat in out spot reclined we heard pounding upstairs like someone was running down the stairs, then a loud bang, and a scream. The scream didnt sound like anyone in the house which made this even more weird. We shot up from our spot and all looked at each other for a few seconds before we all said ""did you hear that?"". I pointed out that it didnt sound like my Dad but it didnt sound like someone broke in either so we rush upstairs to see what happened. Nothing was there or moved out of place so we freaked out and ran to my room just confused. We eventually passed out right away and the next morning my friend Aaron and I told my mother what happened. She went from it was probably one of the animals but when we told her it couldnt have been it then turned into it must have been your father. So I pointed out if it was my Dad you would have heard him get up and then go back upstairs which no one heard. He had an average body type during this time and id maybe an inch smaller than me you would have heard him go back up stairs.

Since that was shorter than my last post Ill give you guys another short story. During my JR year of high school so a few years later I had 2 friends over on a school night. These 2 were like family to us so my Mom was aleays cool with it as long as we were home on time and in bed at a decent time. So my friend Aaron who lived with us was up in my room studying and doing home work while my friend Orlando and I were in the living room. Orlando was watching TV while I was on the computer trying to get a game running on the computer. Orland shuts off the TV and says ""Im going to head upstairs man"" so I tell him ""wait up Im going to shut this off"". I was secretly afraid to shut off everything downstaors because of how creepy the house was at night which resulted in me shutting everything off and running upstairs. So as I stand up we hear through the vents someone yelling. Like an actual person yelling not like air blowing through the vent. I swear it sounded like my name being called my friend claims he just heard a yell. He looks at me and nopes out while I press the power button the pc and run up stairs.

,Thetruthishere,"To preface this, I'm pretty sure the area my friend lives in has occultists because we've had a few strange run ins while out in the wooded suburbs. We just try to ignore strange happenings but also tempt fate a bit which is why we went out walking at night on Friday the 13th. There aren't too many streetlights and sometimes the sidewalks abruptly end so it was dark enough that walking or driving around would require use of a flashlight or headlights (especially to avoid deer). 
Anyway since it was the weekend and we were bored high schoolers at the time, we decided the nearby elementary school would be empty this late at night and we could mess around on the playground. We had an uneventful 20 minute walk over and jumped a medium fence into the playground. Another 20 yards or so further was the front of the school. The front face of the school had a looped road off the main road we walked on, and the only lights on were the outdoor ones on the school's entrance. The front of the school was empty when we walked to the playground, and we sat on the swings talking for half an hour before I noticed there was a cop car sitting outside the school front.
I pointed it out to my friend and she froze.
It was silent outside all night. Neither of us heard the car pull up. The angle the swings were at meant that a car pulling up would've cast it's headlights right on us, which we would've also noticed, but there were no lights. No other cars had passed by either. The car was parked there silently in the dark with only the school's front lights on it. Everything felt wrong about it, it was even an older model car that the county doesn't use anymore.

,Thetruthishere,"So, In Canada, We have a scouts system similar to the US. Our System by level is Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Ventures. This happened during Cubs. 

So, there was this house on the property of the camp. Beautiful house, nice wooden smell, it was great. During this time, all the troops around us, gathered for a weekend up at the house. There were maybe 6-7 troops gathered, we would be doing wooden car racing, etc. 

The house was split into two rooms, one for males, other for females, and there was a closet doors connected to each room. At the time, there was maybe 10-20 guys in one room, and maybe 10-15 females. We would be sleeping on the floors with our sleeping bags. 
After brushing, me and the guys went back to the guys room. We were talking and one of the kids said that this place was haunted, and that the closet that leads into the girls section was where someone was hanged. 

Now, I’m not gonna lie, I always had a strange feeling of the doorway. So much in fact, that I specifically put my sleeping bag across the other side of the room. There was also an air vent there, that I was afraid as well, so I then moved it into the middle, even if I had to sleep in between two guys, I didn’t mind it.

That night, after the counslers shushed us to sleep, cause you know guys, we talk for hours on end if we don’t get told to sleep.

It was around maybe, 4:30. I awoke, my head facing towards the closet, when I notice something going down. The closet door, was slowly opening. I was kinda stunned, girls shouldn’t be peeping on guys. That’s when I see a shadow, no bigger than 6’. It was crazy tall for it’s size. Now, best I can describe from memory, is like the colour Vanta Black (Google it). It was very blurry, but crisp until the middle. It slowly inched it’s way across the wooden floor boards. No sound, nothing. It just silently passed each kid as it went by. I didn’t want this thing to see me, so I turned my head. It passed more kids, the more it went down. I was now trembling. I didn’t know what it wanted. It kept moving slowly, passing a few kids ahead of me, and then it happened. 

The more it got closer, the more I felt dread. Not only did I feel dread, but I felt the air getting colder. And not just the physical feeling cold, it felt cold in my insides. The air got more dry and cold, like Liquid Nitrogen. The greatest amount of that feeling happened when it passed me. I was maybe a few feet to the door, so when it went to the other entrance I was at, I’m not sh*tting you this, it was LITERALLY TURNING THE DOORKNOB. It pulled the door open, and slowly exited, before, strangely enough, shut the door behind itself.

That morning, We were getting up from bed, and walked down the rickity old steps. One of the kids said “Did you guys see that shadow last night”, and maybe 4 kids eyes widened. We all blurted “YES”. We talked about it for a short while, and let’s just say, after that experience.

Through posting this I have finally come into contact with some people who have been or are going thru the same thing I am ,down to the different methods employed on me. My goal through writing these post is that anyone else going through similar events can know they aren't alone, ultimately we can collaborate and demystify this. \n\nThis is my fifth entry, I got ahead of myself on my fourth entry so the events and experiences that I am writing happened before my last entry. If you are just finding this and have not read any of my previous posts I believe I am the star of a reality show that everyone on the planet is in on, including my family,friends literally everyone. I do cling to the possibility I may be mentally ill, I almost hope for it. I move into a new apartment and hope for the best, no more neighbors spying on me, contacting my coworkers, family, friends ect. Unfortunately I am in for a huge disappointment, This new apartment is equipped with new technology, and it is everywhere. Now my sleep is interrupted constantly,my dreams are being manipulated and new methods and tactics are being used. The voices never stop and there are more voices with different sometimes electronic tones. The tone and tempo of there sentences are very strange, but it doesn't seem like they are strange for being stranges sake.  When I first started to hearing them I remember thinking  to myself this is  what you would use to brainwash or hypnotise someone. I later learned these methods were associated with NLP, or nero linguistic programming. They also started using tones to induce me into a trance, then things got wierd, I could write 10 pages on all of the different methods that were used, if you are going thru something similar message me and i can elaborate or we can trade stories. I could go on about every detail but my last entry was seven pages and I don't have that time. . As a side note I've been in  contact with more than a few people that are going through this, so your not alone. Anyways I have transitioned from being heckled by passer bys neighbors everyone to hearing things all the time in every sound possible, the wind electricity anything with a sound produces voices, I am told its programming. I could and can only speculate but it seemed they were  programming themselves into all surrounding and ambient sound. At  times I would enter what I called dual mode, basically my mouth would move with the words I heard them speaking, they  called this parroting. My mind was feeling foggy , it always did but now it felt more sluggish these voices didnt go away, how were  they following me to this level with this new pinpoint accuracy? They were making up songs and constantly singing. I had this overwhelming thought of I”have to do something” the thought was over whelming  unrelenting, and on a fast loop. I later realized  that among other things it was possible  to implant streams of thought in my mind. For now at this point the only thing that makes sense is everyone on the planet is participating in a reality show Im the star of collaborating to mess with me. Its the only possible explanation, I may be schizophrenic ,but its a very small possibility in my mind. I try to convince myself I am but I keep getting bombarded with new information and experiences Im just not intelligent enough to make up. Anyway I have moved into this new apartment and my sunny optimism of a fresh start has been shit on, on top of the reality show continuing Im being hit harder and wondering how my life has turned into this. Although I've accepted everyone on the planet is in  on it, as a defense mechanism I think maybe everyone isn't participating. One day I traded in my car and got a brand new one. On top of being excited for the new car I thought that maybe there was a possibility this car had not been hacked yet, I would finally have a car where I would be free of any cameras, microphones or speakers being hacked. I was in for a disappointment as soon as I drove off of the dealership I heard the voices, this put me in a very fowl mood I felt so hopeless so helpless to do anything or escape, truly everyone on the planet was in on this, It did take along time for the dealership to fill up the tank and put on the temp tags they must have installed cameras and hacked the bluetooth. I knew I was going to be unpleasant so I let my family do what we had planned for the evening without me and stayed home. My neighbors were badgering me through the hidden speakers and watching me through there hidden cameras and I had enough, I couldn't kill anyone and go to prison, if my life could be made hell like this on the outside i could only imagine what their reach would extend to on the inside of a prison. I decided to kill myself. I sat inside the bathroom on the toilet and had a razor every time I would start cutting they would start talking, at times they would say don't do it, don't leave your family, then they would say whats taking you soo long? “Your just trying to make everyone feel bad for you”. After a couple of hours of trying to cut and it hurting and being tired of the audience I decided Im done, I wont be a spectacle and I wont do this in front of everyone to be broadcast  over these hidden cameras. I decided I was going to kill myself where no one can see, I was going to find a tall bridge and jump off. I called a cab, when it arrived I turned off my phone so my location could not be tracked. I had the cab drop me about 20 miles away near a high exit ramp. I debated walking up the ramp to jump but decided I would look odd walking the opposite direction of traffic on a tollway and may get arrested and my plan would be foiled and Id be in jail to boot. New plan, I would walk until I saw a high building I could access,climb up and jump from there. I walked about 20 minutes heard and no voices, I was successful I had lost them. I finally found a building that was under construction and easily accessible. I accessed the stairwell and climbed to the top I think it was 10 stories, It would definitely do the trick.  I walked to the edge and looked down,  I pulled my wallet and phone out of my pocket. I turned my phone on and tried to write my wife a message telling her I loved her and I was sorry but it was at 1 percent so it was the most pathetic suicide message ever, “killilng myself, phones about to die love you sorry”, I put my phone and wallet on the ledge and prepared to lean foward enough to lose my balance and fall, then I hear “do it hurry up” I look where the voices are coming from and theres a crane doing construction on a nearby building. Then I see construction workers on the building the crane is working on encouraging me to jump. What the fuck why are they operating a crane at night and why are they such dicks? I go to the otherside of the building facing the tollway nobody yelling or looking, then I hear all of the familiar voices that have been tormenting me, having a blast using there voice filters.” How the fuck did you find me” “cant you let me do this in private? “  “No, we wanna watch, plus your not even crying you're not gonna do it. “ , and if you are you better hurry” “you are the perfect definition of a loser” why don't you stop being a loser?” “fuck you, you are the loser” the rest is a back and forth of blah blah blah. I finally asked why? A familiar female voice said “power” this pissed me off so much I decided i was gonna tough this out and one day show them power, I was going to have revenge. I walked for 2 hours freezing with no jacket looking like an insane person yelling at the air. I finally got to a gas station and bought a charger to charge my phone. I went to the bathroom and looked at myself I looked disheveled and by wrist were bleeding. My phone charged and I called my wife to pick me up. She was so surprised to hear my voice after the message I sent her. Anyways now my mind was on the fact that they tracked me down so fast and the voices came out of no where, I came to the conclusion they were using very small drones, looking back all of these  answers and rationalizations I came up with were a self defense mechanism. I couldn't accept or entertain the possibility that through technology, spiritualism whatever something was inside me, cohabitating with me.

,Thetruthishere,"When a strange or an unexplained thing happens it usually lasts only a moment or perhaps only a few minutes and as the weeks, months and years pass by you're no longer certain of what you have actually witnessed, if anything at all. The story that I want to tell however is one where the unexplained has lasted a whole night, so the experience is unpleasantly fresh in my mind even though it happened more that two decades ago. Perhaps smarter people than me will be able to come up with a rational explanation, or maybe there will be someone who had similar experiences.

It happened in the late 90s when I was 13 years old. My grandfather, who lived in another town, has fallen ill and my parents had to leave in a hurry to assist my grandma. I was left to my own devices, and as any teenager my age I was more than happy to be alone with all the computer games I could play. At the time we were living in a small two bedroom apartment, with a dog that looked scary, but in reality was the kindest and gentlest animal.

I spend the whole day playing video games. By the time I would usually go to bed I got a call from my father telling me that grandpa died. He told me that they will be staying in the other town to arrange the funeral. I got upset and cried for a while. I didn't want to go to bed so I went to the kitchen and cooked a frozen pizza. It was almost midnight by the time I finished eating. I decided to watch some TV thinking that perhaps it will help me fall asleep. As I was changing channels I stumbled upon some porn. Being a teenager with no easy access to porn, my horniness overcame any sadness and I spend some time masturbating. After I was done I took a shower and went to bed.

As I was going to bed I called the dog into the room since she would just scratch the door if I were to leave her outside. I closed the bedroom door and cozied up under the blanket. This is when I began to hear strange sounds from the kitchen, with which my bedroom shared a wall. The sounds were exactly what you would hear when you place kitchenware on a table. For example when you put a cup on a counter-top, or a knife on a plate, only louder. I could distinctively hear those sounds, and there was no mistake that the sounds were coming from the kitchen.

The dog heard the sounds too, I looked at her and she was starring at the wall intently. Things started to get much noisier. Within minutes I could hear ruckus from beyond the wall. Plates hitting other plates, metal clanking, hollow sounds when something hits a wooden table and many more in a bizarre cacophony. I was literally paralyzed with fear, for the first half an hour I wouldn't dare to move. During that time the dog became livid and began barking, not at the wall but at the door.

As time passed I had ample time to reassure myself that this wasn't a dream, and that this was really happening. The dog kept barking at the door and I finally gathered some courage to move. I sat up and after staring at the wall for a while, I looked at the door. It looked as if I was safe, and I was certainly glad that the dog was with me in the room. During the next hours the commotion continued while I was able to get up from the bed and slowly approach the door. After a while I was holding the doorknob, but I never gathered up enough courage to actually open the door. It wasn't just my fear: when I looked at the dog I could see what I can only describe as terror in her eyes as she kept barking.

It took me some time to return and sit on the bed. An hour perhaps, since I was still afraid to move too quickly, partially because I didn't want to miss any of the noise coming closer, and partially because I was too afraid that I might attract attention of whatever it was that was making it. Once I was sitting I looked out of the window, but I couldn't see anything, it was pitch dark. I decided that the best strategy for me would be to sit quietly and wait for the morning.

As the dawn came I could hear the noise die out slowly just as it came. The noises became weak and rare enough that I could hear the building's elevator in the distance. And very soon the dog calmed down. Just sitting looking at me looking at her. I waited for about another hour and decided that it was probably safe to come out. When I entered the kitchen I couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. Everything was as I remembered it.

To this day I don't know what exactly was making that noise. All I know it was coming from the kitchen, it was strong and it lasted all night. I tried really hard to come up with a rational explanation. My line of thinking was that perhaps someone has broken in to the apartment. But the problem with that theory was that the front door, and the balcony door were both locked, there were no signs of break-in. And besides why would anybody break-in just to make noise, without taking anything and without leaving a trace.

The closest paranormal explanation is poltergeist. The problem is that I don't really believe in paranormal, so that “explanation” was never enough for me. I was shaky for about a week afterwards, afraid to sleep, but fortunately the hellish cacophony never came back.",t2_3eedb,False,,0,False,[CHI] The night after my grandfather died,[],r/Thetruthishere,False,6,4,0,False,t3_fbyirb,False,dark,,public,11,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Poltergeist ,False,11,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583117237.0,text,6,,,text,self.Thetruthishere,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a strange or an unexplained thing happens it usually lasts only a moment or perhaps only a few minutes and as the weeks, months and years pass by you&amp;#39;re no longer certain of what you have actually witnessed, if anything at all. The story that I want to tell however is one where the unexplained has lasted a whole night, so the experience is unpleasantly fresh in my mind even though it happened more that two decades ago. Perhaps smarter people than me will be able to come up with a rational explanation, or maybe there will be someone who had similar experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened in the late 90s when I was 13 years old. My grandfather, who lived in another town, has fallen ill and my parents had to leave in a hurry to assist my grandma. I was left to my own devices, and as any teenager my age I was more than happy to be alone with all the computer games I could play. At the time we were living in a small two bedroom apartment, with a dog that looked scary, but in reality was the kindest and gentlest animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend the whole day playing video games. By the time I would usually go to bed I got a call from my father telling me that grandpa died. He told me that they will be staying in the other town to arrange the funeral. I got upset and cried for a while. I didn&amp;#39;t want to go to bed so I went to the kitchen and cooked a frozen pizza. It was almost midnight by the time I finished eating. I decided to watch some TV thinking that perhaps it will help me fall asleep. As I was changing channels I stumbled upon some porn. Being a teenager with no easy access to porn, my horniness overcame any sadness and I spend some time masturbating. After I was done I took a shower and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was going to bed I called the dog into the room since she would just scratch the door if I were to leave her outside. I closed the bedroom door and cozied up under the blanket. This is when I began to hear strange sounds from the kitchen, with which my bedroom shared a wall. The sounds were exactly what you would hear when you place kitchenware on a table. For example when you put a cup on a counter-top, or a knife on a plate, only louder. I could distinctively hear those sounds, and there was no mistake that the sounds were coming from the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog heard the sounds too, I looked at her and she was starring at the wall intently. Things started to get much noisier. Within minutes I could hear ruckus from beyond the wall.

So this happened a few years ago, but the memory stuck with me and I remember it clear as day. I’m Vietnamese and my family celebrates Lunar New Year every year which is a holiday where we exchange red envelopes as a tradition. (The red envelopes contain money and it’s for good luck for the new year). 

My grandma does this lottery thing where she puts a 5 or 10 dollar bill in every red envelope, but only ONE of them has a 100 dollar bill, which was the jackpot. I have quite a few cousins so maybe around like 10 or 15 (my grandma was holding like 30 envelopes tho because my aunts and uncles also get to choose one) and we line up from youngest to oldest. I was one of the older cousins so I’m never in the front.

When it was my turn to choose an envelope, there was this one envelope I just KNEW for certain that it had the 100 dollar bill. I can’t even describe the feeling. I just had this deep certainty about it. If u asked me to bet my life on it during that moment, I would have (just shows that I knew 100%). I chose it, no hesitation and I opened it up a few minutes later. It was the 100 dollar bill.

I tried to play it off as maybe it was just a rlly lucky coincidence, but I still couldn’t find a reason on how I just KNEW? I didn’t see any of the red envelopes before hand at all. Anyway, every year after that incident, I’ve been trying to see if I could get certainty feeling again and I haven’t had that same feeling since. I still have no rational explanation for it.

I’m in the middle of nowhere, on a weird off-on-it’s-own cul de sac with houses on only one side and woods all around it. Other than the cul de sac houses are all over 100yards(m) away from each other. The woods are thick and begin about 30ft (10m) away from our house. 
The area is not known to have any bears (those are far further north), no wolves or coywolves, and our coyotes are rather small and very shy. As are the deer. I even contacted our local DFW and they said there was nothing bigger than coyote and deer out here. 

I take the dogs out into the yard to pee 2-3 times after dark. I put them on a split leash and normally wander around the yard for a bit to let them find a spot, but that has come to an end. I don’t dare step off the patio now. 

For the past few weeks, my dogs have been acting really odd when it comes to going out at night. They want to go out front, but since my landlord doesn’t want me to let them ruin the front lawn I have to drag them to the backdoor. And they refuse to step out most times, especially my younger dog. They want to stay close to the house, and are always VERY alert. 
They will lunge towards the woods at random, starting to bark like crazy. I would normally call this off as wildlife, but it’s been getting really weird. And normally if there is something like a rabbit, they are very easily shushed and redirected. 

I’ve heard whatever it is walking, right at the edge of the woods. It doesn’t have the typical 4-beat walk of a 4 legged animal, and it is not scared of my dogs. I can hear it’s heavy by the way the leaves scrunch and the branches crack. It is not scared of the dogs, or me shouting, and it does not leave. If it’s there at 9 pm, it’ll be there at midnight, and it’ll be there at 2am. Always at the edge of the woods. And I can feel a difference myself, too. Even when I go out alone (I had to grab a patio chair the other day, for example) it’s almost like I can feel when it’s there. I’m normally very relaxed in my yard, even at night. But I’ll get that backshuddering, heartracing get-in-get-in-get-in feeling. 

My dogs will even go crazy when inside, seemingly at random. Standing at the windows barking out to the woods. 

I’ve been out there during the day, looking for things like fur scraps, scat, stag, or clawmarks, etc. Nothing turned up. Not even footsteps (thought it would have been a person, perhaps)

I’m trying really hard to find a reasonable excuse for what might have been happening. But I keep running into dead ends. 

I’m an immigrant, I’m not too knowledgeable on the local stuff... “folklore” or whatever you wanna call it. But holy hell this scares the life out of me.

,Thetruthishere,"Hey it’s me again ya boy with the weird dreams and run-on sentences. I’m visiting home for the weekend and now that I’m back in my childhood room I’m having a lot of things come back to me. 

As a kid I often called for my parents in the night because I wasn’t afraid of the dark I was afraid of what was in the dark specifically in my closet. As normal and cliche as it is I always felt much safer when the doors were closed. However there would be times when if I slept with my back facing my room and doorway I’d get the feeling and mental image of a large figure either coming from beneath my bed or materializing in my room and running its fingers down my back. 

There were two forms it takes one is a woman and I can’t tell if she’s young or old but she seems sad and angry. I think she lost her child though because her touch, as frightening as it was, tended to be more gentle though I could feel the rage in her. She tended to materialize more in the room. The second is far bigger and its touch more frightening. It is this giant figure draped in seaweed or rags or something. Like a mummy but not all stiff and decomposing. It seems more remorseful but still has something horrific behind it. 

They don’t seem to be very active now and since I’m much older I haven’t seemed to be in tune with them much. My odd theory is they’re somehow connected possibly they lost a child or were together and suffered. I also felt things in my dad’s office, the living room, and the guest bathroom. My parents have been in this house for nearly 30 years and haven’t really had anything odd happen to them in that time and as far as I know there isn’t anything that happened in the house before them or to the land it’s built on. Maybe they’re attached to the house or maybe they’re attached to me but at college they can’t manifest as easily cause of my current state or the sheer number of people around me. 

Do any of you have spirits that were with you when you were young?

I’m visiting home for the weekend and now that I’m back in my childhood room I’m having a lot of things come back to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid I often called for my parents in the night because I wasn’t afraid of the dark I was afraid of what was in the dark specifically in my closet. As normal and cliche as it is I always felt much safer when the doors were closed. However there would be times when if I slept with my back facing my room and doorway I’d get the feeling and mental image of a large figure either coming from beneath my bed or materializing in my room and running its fingers down my back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two forms it takes one is a woman and I can’t tell if she’s young or old but she seems sad and angry. I think she lost her child though because her touch, as frightening as it was, tended to be more gentle though I could feel the rage in her. She tended to materialize more in the room. The second is far bigger and its touch more frightening. It is this giant figure draped in seaweed or rags or something. Like a mummy but not all stiff and decomposing. It seems more remorseful but still has something horrific behind it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t seem to be very active now and since I’m much older I haven’t seemed to be in tune with them much. My odd theory is they’re somehow connected possibly they lost a child or were together and suffered. I also felt things in my dad’s office, the living room, and the guest bathroom.

,Thetruthishere,"This is my written encounter with Robert the Doll.

Detailed as follows is the meeting and later encounter with the spirit or entity attached to the doll. Then an explanation of any bad luck that has happened.

Everything that happened is real. I experienced it while awake. I was on no substances that could cause a hallucination and have never partaken in anything that would be considered a drug or illegal substance. You choose what you believe but my eyes saw what they saw and I heard what I heard. 

I went on vacation with my family to Key West a few years ago. We decided to go to the museum to visit and I honestly did want to go see Robert in person because I had read about him before. I took a picture at one point that had him in the background. It was not a direct picture in front of him. This was enough to get his attention though but I did delete the picture later and it no longer exists. 

When he visited me (this means the entity moved from the doll) I heard laughing and turned on the light to see the metal pull cord to the fan (it was on but I had never seen it move the chain prior to this) spinning around like someone had pulled it or was messing around with it. This was the extent of any interaction I have had with the entity away from the doll itself. Nothing happened while I was at the museum or during the day up to this point. 

Since taking the picture and the visit I have not had anything that I would call unfortunate or terrible in a life-ruining way. I have a nice job that I like now and life has been normal. I think there is a chance Robert may know when someone makes a mistake or is intentionally going up and taking his picture with full knowledge of what they are doing. Basically, if you play with fire, in this case, you will probably get burned.
